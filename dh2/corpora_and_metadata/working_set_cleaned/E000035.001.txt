caleb williams or things as they are by william godwin   preface by the author the following narrative is intended to answer a purpose more general and important than immediately appears upon the face of it the question now afloat in the world respecting things as they are is the most interesting that can be presented to the human mind while one party pleads for reformation and change the other extols in the warmest terms the existing constitution of society it seemed as if something would be gained for the decision of this question if that constitution were faithfully developed in its practical effects what is now presented to the public is no refined and abstract speculation it is a study and delineation of things passing in the moral world it is but of late that the inestimable importance of political principles has been adequately apprehended it is now known to philosophers that the spirit and character of the government intrudes itself into every rank of society but this is a truth highly worthy to be communicated to persons whom books of philosophy and science are never likely to reach accordingly it was proposed in the invention of the following work to comprehend as far as the progressive nature of a single story would allow a general review of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism by which man becomes the destroyer of man if the author shall have taught a valuable lesson without subtracting from the interest and passion by which a performance of this sort ought to be characterised he will have reason to congratulate himself upon the vehicle he has chosen may         this preface was withdrawn in the original edition in compliance with the alarms of booksellers caleb williams made his first appearance in the world in the same month in which the sanguinary plot broke out against the liberties of englishmen which was happily terminated by the acquittal of its first intended victims in the close of that year terror was the order of the day and it was feared that even the humble novelist might be shown to be constructively a traitor october          authors latest preface london november  0      caleb williams has always been regarded by the public with an unusual degree of favour the proprietor of the standard novels has therefore imagined that even an account of the concoction and mode of writing of the work would be viewed with some interest i finished the enquiry concerning political justice the first work which may be considered as written by me in a certain degree in the maturity of my intellectual powers and bearing my name early in january      and about the middle of the following month the book was published it was my fortune at that time to be obliged to consider my pen as the sole instrument for supplying my current expenses by the liberality of my bookseller mr george robinson of paternoster row i was enabled then and for nearly ten years before to meet these expenses while writing different things of obscure note the names of which though innocent and in some degree useful i am rather inclined to suppress in may      i projected this my favourite work and from that time gave up every other occupation that might interfere with it my agreement with robinson was that he was to supply my wants at a specified rate while the book was in the train of composition finally i was very little beforehand with the world on the day of its publication and was therefore obliged to look round and consider to what species of industry i should next devote myself i had always felt in myself some vocation towards the composition of a narrative of fictitious adventure and among the things of obscure note which i have above referred to were two or three pieces of this nature it is not therefore extraordinary that some project of the sort should have suggested itself on the present occasion but i stood now in a very different situation from that in which i had been placed at a former period in past years and even almost from boyhood i was perpetually prone to exclaim with cowley what shall i do to be for ever known and make the age to come my own but i had endeavoured for ten years and was as far from approaching my object as ever everything i wrote fell deadborn from the press very often i was disposed to quit the enterprise in despair but still i felt ever and anon impelled to repeat my effort at length i conceived the plan of political justice i was convinced that my object of building to myself a name would never be attained by merely repeating and refining a little upon what other men had said even though i should imagine that i delivered things of this sort with a more than usual point and elegance the world i believed would accept nothing from me with distinguishing favour that did not bear upon the face of it the undoubted stamp of originality having long ruminated upon the principles of political justice i persuaded myself that i could offer to the public in a treatise on this subject things at once new true and important in the progress of the work i became more sanguine and confident i talked over my ideas with a few familiar friends during its progress and they gave me every generous encouragement it happened that the fame of my book in some inconsiderable degree got before its publication and a certain number of persons were prepared to receive it with favour it would be false modesty in me to say that its acceptance when published did not nearly come up to everything that could soberly have been expected by me in consequence of this the tone of my mind both during the period in which i was engaged in the work and afterwards acquired a certain elevation and made me now unwilling to stoop to what was insignificant i formed a conception of a book of fictitious adventure that should in some way be distinguished by a very powerful interest pursuing this idea i invented first the third volume of my tale then the second and last of all the first i bent myself to the conception of a series of adventures of flight and pursuit the fugitive in perpetual apprehension of being overwhelmed with the worst calamities and the pursuer by his ingenuity and resources keeping his victim in a state of the most fearful alarm this was the project of my third volume i was next called upon to conceive a dramatic and impressive situation adequate to account for the impulse that the pursuer should feel incessantly to alarm and harass his victim with an inextinguishable resolution never to allow him the least interval of peace and security this i apprehended could best be effected by a secret murder to the investigation of which the innocent victim should be impelled by an unconquerable spirit of curiosity the murderer would thus have a sufficient motive to persecute the unhappy discoverer that he might deprive him of peace character and credit and have him for ever in his power this constituted the outline of my second volume the subject of the first volume was still to be invented to account for the fearful events of the third it was necessary that the pursuer should be invested with every advantage of fortune with a resolution that nothing could defeat or baffle and with extraordinary resources of intellect nor could my purpose of giving an overpowering interest to my tale be answered without his appearing to have been originally endowed with a mighty store of amiable dispositions and virtues so that his being driven to the first act of murder should be judged worthy of the deepest regret and should be seen in some measure to have arisen out of his virtues themselves it was necessary to make him so to speak the tenant of an atmosphere of romance so that every reader should feel prompted almost to worship him for his high qualities here were ample materials for a first volume i felt that i had a great advantage in thus carrying back my invention from the ultimate conclusion to the first commencement of the train of adventures upon which i purposed to employ my pen an entire unity of plot would be the infallible result and the unity of spirit and interest in a tale truly considered gives it a powerful hold on the reader which can scarcely be generated with equal success in any other way i devoted about two or three weeks to the imagining and putting down hints for my story before i engaged seriously and methodically in its composition in these hints i began with my third volume then proceeded to my second and last of all grappled with the first i filled two or three sheets of demy writingpaper folded in octavo with these memorandums they were put down with great brevity yet explicitly enough to secure a perfect recollection of their meaning within the time necessary for drawing out the story at full in short paragraphs of two three four five or six lines each i then sat down to write my story from the beginning i wrote for the most part but a short portion in any single day i wrote only when the afflatus was upon me i held it for a maxim that any portion that was written when i was not fully in the vein told for considerably worse than nothing idleness was a thousand times better in this case than industry against the grain idleness was only time lost and the next day it may be was as promising as ever it was merely a day perished from the calendar but a passage written feebly flatly and in a wrong spirit constituted an obstacle that it was next to impossible to correct and set right again i wrote therefore by starts sometimes for a week or ten days not a line yet all came to the same thing in the sequel on an average a volume of caleb williams cost me four months neither less nor more it must be admitted however that during the whole period bating a few intervals my mind was in a high state of excitement i said to myself a thousand times i will write a tale that shall constitute an epoch in the mind of the reader that no one after he has read it shall ever be exactly the same man that he was beforeâ€”i put these things down just as they happened and with the most entire frankness i know that it will sound like the most pitiable degree of selfconceit but such perhaps ought to be the state of mind of an author when he does his best at any rate i have said nothing of my vainglorious impulse for nearly forty years when i had written about seventenths of the first volume i was prevailed upon by the extreme importunity of an old and intimate friend to allow him the perusal of my manuscript on the second day he returned it with a note to this purpose i return you your manuscript because i promised to do so if i had obeyed the impulse of my own mind i should have thrust it in the fire if you persist the book will infallibly prove the grave of your literary fame i doubtless felt no implicit deference for the judgment of my friendly critic yet it cost me at least two days of deep anxiety before i recovered the shock let the reader picture to himself my situation i felt no implicit deference for the judgment of my friendly critic but it was all i had for it this was my first experiment of an unbiassed decision it stood in the place of all the world to me i could not and i did not feel disposed to appeal any further if i had how could i tell that the second and third judgment would be more favourable than the first then what would have been the result no i had nothing for it but to wrap myself in my own integrity by dint of resolution i became invulnerable i resolved to go on to the end trusting as i could to my own anticipations of the whole and bidding the world wait its time before it should be admitted to the consult i began my narrative as is the more usual way in the third person but i speedily became dissatisfied i then assumed the first person making the hero of my tale his own historian and in this mode i have persisted in all my subsequent attempts at works of fiction it was infinitely the best adapted at least to my vein of delineation where the thing in which my imagination revelled the most freely was the analysis of the private and internal operations of the mind employing my metaphysical dissecting knife in tracing and laying bare the involutions of motive and recording the gradually accumulating impulses which led the personages i had to describe primarily to adopt the particular way of proceeding in which they afterwards embarked when i had determined on the main purpose of my story it was ever my method to get about me any productions of former authors that seemed to bear on my subject i never entertained the fear that in this way of proceeding i should be in danger of servilely copying my predecessors i imagined that i had a vein of thinking that was properly my own which would always preserve me from plagiarism i read other authors that i might see what they had done or more properly that i might forcibly hold my mind and occupy my thoughts in a particular train i and my predecessors travelling in some sense to the same goal at the same time that i struck out a path of my own without ultimately heeding the direction they pursued and disdaining to inquire whether by any chance it for a few steps coincided or did not coincide with mine thus in the instance of caleb williams i read over a little old book entitled the adventures of mademoiselle de st phale a french protestant in the times of the fiercest persecution of the huguenots who fled through france in the utmost terror in the midst of eternal alarms and hairbreadth escapes having her quarters perpetually beaten up and by scarcely any chance finding a moments interval of security i turned over the pages of a tremendous compilation entitled gods revenge against murder where the beam of the eye of omniscience was represented as perpetually pursuing the guilty and laying open his most hidden retreats to the light of day i was extremely conversant with the newgate calendar and the lives of the pirates in the meantime no works of fiction came amiss to me provided they were written with energy the authors were still employed upon the same mine as myself however different was the vein they pursued we were all of us engaged in exploring the entrails of mind and motive and in tracing the various rencontres and clashes that may occur between man and man in the diversified scene of human life i rather amused myself with tracing a certain similitude between the story of caleb williams and the tale of bluebeard than derived any hints from that admirable specimen of the terrific falkland was my bluebeard who had perpetrated atrocious crimes which if discovered he might expect to have all the world roused to revenge against him caleb williams was the wife who in spite of warning persisted in his attempts to discover the forbidden secret and when he had succeeded struggled as fruitlessly to escape the consequences as the wife of bluebeard in washing the key of the ensanguined chamber who as often as she cleared the stain of blood from the one side found it showing itself with frightful distinctness on the other when i had proceeded as far as the early pages of my third volume i found myself completely at a stand i rested on my arms from the  nd of january      to the  st of april following without getting forward in the smallest degree it has ever been thus with me in works of any continuance the bow will not be for ever bent opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum i endeavoured however to take my repose to myself in security and not to inflict a set of crude and incoherent dreams upon my readers in the meantime when i revived i revived in earnest and in the course of that month carried on my work with unabated speed to the end thus i have endeavoured to give a true history of the concoction and mode of writing of this mighty trifle when i had done i soon became sensible that i had done in a manner nothing how many flat and insipid parts does the book contain how terribly unequal does it appear to me from time to time the author plainly reels to and fro like a drunken man and when i had done all what had i done written a book to amuse boys and girls in their vacant hours a story to be hastily gobbled up by them swallowed in a pusillanimous and unanimated mood without chewing and digestion i was in this respect greatly impressed with the confession of one of the most accomplished readers and excellent critics that any author could have fallen in with the unfortunate joseph gerald he told me that he had received my book late one evening and had read through the three volumes before he closed his eyes thus what had cost me twelve months labour ceaseless heartaches and industry now sinking in despair and now roused and sustained in unusual energy he went over in a few hours shut the book laid himself on his pillow slept and was refreshed and cried tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new i had thought to have said something here respecting the concoction of st leon and fleetwood but all that occurs to me on the subject seems to be anticipated in the following  preface to the first edition february      0  yet another novel from the same pen which has twice before claimed the patience of the public in this form the unequivocal indulgence which has been extended to my two former attempts renders me doubly solicitous not to forfeit the kindness i have experienced one caution i have particularly sought to exercise not to repeat myself caleb williams was a story of very surprising and uncommon events but which were supposed to be entirely within the laws and established course of nature as she operates in the planet we inhabit the story of st leon is of the miraculous class and its design to mix human feelings and passions with incredible situations and thus render them impressive and interesting some of those fastidious readersâ€”they may be classed among the best friends an author has if their admonitions are judiciously consideredâ€”who are willing to discover those faults which do not offer themselves to every eye have remarked that both these tales are in a vicious style of writing that horace has long ago decided that the story we cannot believe we are by all the laws of criticism called upon to hate and that even the adventures of the honest secretary who was first heard of ten years ago are so much out of the usual road that not one reader in a million can ever fear they will happen to himself gentlemen critics i thank you in the present volumes i have served you with a dish agreeable to your own receipt though i cannot say with any sanguine hope of obtaining your approbation the following story consists of such adventures as for the most part have occurred to at least one half of the englishmen now existing who are of the same rank of life as my hero most of them have been at college and shared in college excesses most of them have afterward run a certain gauntlet of dissipation most have married and i am afraid there are few of the married tribe who have not at some time or other had certain small misunderstandings with their wives  to be sure they have not all of them felt and acted under these trite adventures as my hero does in this little work the reader will scarcely find anything to elevate and surprise and if it has any merit it must consist in the liveliness with which it brings things home to the imagination and the reality it gives to the scenes it pourtrays yes even in the present narrative i have aimed at a certain kind of noveltyâ€”a novelty which may be aptly expressed by a parody on a wellknown line of pope it relates things often done but never yet described in selecting among common and ordinary adventures i have endeavoured to avoid such as a thousand novels before mine have undertaken to develop multitudes of readers have themselves passed through the very incidents i relate but for the most part no work has hitherto recorded them if i have told them truly i have added somewhat to the stock of books which should enable a recluse shut up in his closet to form an idea of what is passing in the world it is inconceivable meanwhile how much by this choice of a subject i increased the arduousness of my task it is so easy to do a little better or a little worse what twenty authors have done before if i had foreseen from the first all the difficulty of my project my courage would have failed me to undertake the execution of it certain persons who condescend to make my supposed inconsistencies the favourite object of their research will perhaps remark with exultation on the respect expressed in this work for marriage and exclaim it was not always thus referring to the pages in which this subject is treated in the enquiry concerning political justice for the proof of their assertion the answer to this remark is exceedingly simple the production referred to in it the first foundation of its authors claim to public distinction and favour was a treatise aiming to ascertain what new institutions in political society might be found more conducive to general happiness than those which at present prevail in the course of this disquisition it was enquired whether marriage as it stands described and supported in the laws of england might not with advantage admit of certain modifications can anything be more distinct than such a proposition on the one hand and a recommendation on the other that each man for himself should supersede and trample upon the institutions of the country in which he lives a thousand things might be found excellent and salutary if brought into general practice which would in some cases appear ridiculous and in others be attended with tragical consequences if prematurely acted upon by a solitary individual the author of political justice as appears again and again in the pages of that work is the last man in the world to recommend a pitiful attempt by scattered examples to renovate the face of society instead of endeavouring by discussion and reasoning to effect a grand and comprehensive improvement in the sentiments of its members  volume the first  chapter i my life has for several years been a theatre of calamity i have been a mark for the vigilance of tyranny and i could not escape my fairest prospects have been blasted my enemy has shown himself inaccessible to entreaties and untired in persecution my fame as well as my happiness has become his victim every one as far as my story has been known has refused to assist me in my distress and has execrated my name i have not deserved this treatment my own conscience witnesses in behalf of that innocence my pretensions to which are regarded in the world as incredible there is now however little hope that i shall escape from the toils that universally beset me i am incited to the penning of these memoirs only by a desire to divert my mind from the deplorableness of my situation and a faint idea that posterity may by their means be induced to render me a justice which my contemporaries refuse my story will at least appear to have that consistency which is seldom attendant but upon truth i was born of humble parents in a remote county of england their occupations were such as usually fall to the lot of peasants and they had no portion to give me but an education free from the usual sources of depravity and the inheritance long since lost by their unfortunate progeny of an honest fame i was taught the rudiments of no science except reading writing and arithmetic but i had an inquisitive mind and neglected no means of information from conversation or books my improvement was greater than my condition in life afforded room to expect there are other circumstances deserving to be mentioned as having influenced the history of my future life i was somewhat above the middle stature without being particularly athletic in appearance or large in my dimensions i was uncommonly vigorous and active my joints were supple and i was formed to excel in youthful sports the habits of my mind however were to a certain degree at war with the dictates of boyish vanity i had considerable aversion to the boisterous gaiety of the village gallants and contrived to satisfy my love of praise with an unfrequent apparition at their amusements my excellence in these respects however gave a turn to my meditations i delighted to read of feats of activity and was particularly interested by tales in which corporeal ingenuity or strength are the means resorted to for supplying resources and conquering difficulties i inured myself to mechanical pursuits and devoted much of my time to an endeavour after mechanical invention the spring of action which perhaps more than any other characterised the whole train of my life was curiosity it was this that gave me my mechanical turn i was desirous of tracing the variety of effects which might be produced from given causes it was this that made me a sort of natural philosopher i could not rest till i had acquainted myself with the solutions that had been invented for the phenomena of the universe in fine this produced in me an invincible attachment to books of narrative and romance i panted for the unravelling of an adventure with an anxiety perhaps almost equal to that of the man whose future happiness or misery depended on its issue i read i devoured compositions of this sort they took possession of my soul and the effects they produced were frequently discernible in my external appearance and my health my curiosity however was not entirely ignoble village anecdotes and scandal had no charms for me my imagination must be excited and when that was not done my curiosity was dormant the residence of my parents was within the manor of ferdinando falkland a country squire of considerable opulence at an early age i attracted the favourable notice of mr collins this gentlemans steward who used to call in occasionally at my fathers he observed the particulars of my progress with approbation and made a favourable report to his master of my industry and genius in the summer of the year  mr falkland visited his estate in our county after an absence of several months this was a period of misfortune to me i was then eighteen years of age my father lay dead in our cottage i had lost my mother some years before in this forlorn situation i was surprised with a message from the squire ordering me to repair to the mansionhouse the morning after my fathers funeral though i was not a stranger to books i had no practical acquaintance with men i had never had occasion to address a person of this elevated rank and i felt no small uneasiness and awe on the present occasion i found mr falkland a man of small stature with an extreme delicacy of form and appearance in place of the hardfavoured and inflexible visages i had been accustomed to observe every muscle and petty line of his countenance seemed to be in an inconceivable degree pregnant with meaning his manner was kind attentive and humane his eye was full of animation but there was a grave and sad solemnity in his air which for want of experience i imagined was the inheritance of the great and the instrument by which the distance between them and their inferiors was maintained his look bespoke the unquietness of his mind and frequently wandered with an expression of disconsolateness and anxiety my reception was as gracious and encouraging as i could possibly desire mr falkland questioned me respecting my learning and my conceptions of men and things and listened to my answers with condescension and approbation this kindness soon restored to me a considerable part of my selfpossession though i still felt restrained by the graceful but unaltered dignity of his carriage when mr falkland had satisfied his curiosity he proceeded to inform me that he was in want of a secretary that i appeared to him sufficiently qualified for that office and that if in my present change of situation occasioned by the death of my father i approved of the employment he would take me into his family i felt highly flattered by the proposal and was warm in the expression of my acknowledgments i set eagerly about the disposal of the little property my father had left in which i was assisted by mr collins i had not now a relation in the world upon whose kindness and interposition i had any direct claim but far from regarding this deserted situation with terror i formed golden visions of the station i was about to occupy i little suspected that the gaiety and lightness of heart i had hitherto enjoyed were upon the point of leaving me for ever and that the rest of my days were devoted to misery and alarm my employment was easy and agreeable it consisted partly in the transcribing and arranging certain papers and partly in writing from my masters dictation letters of business as well as sketches of literary composition many of these latter consisted of an analytical survey of the plans of different authors and conjectural speculations upon hints they afforded tending either to the detection of their errors or the carrying forward their discoveries all of them bore powerful marks of a profound and elegant mind well stored with literature and possessed of an uncommon share of activity and discrimination my station was in that part of the house which was appropriated for the reception of books it being my duty to perform the functions of librarian as well as secretary here my hours would have glided in tranquillity and peace had not my situation included in it circumstances totally different from those which attended me in my fathers cottage in early life my mind had been much engrossed by reading and reflection my intercourse with my fellow mortals was occasional and short but in my new residence i was excited by every motive of interest and novelty to study my masters character and i found in it an ample field for speculation and conjecture his mode of living was in the utmost degree recluse and solitary he had no inclination to scenes of revelry and mirth he avoided the busy haunts of men nor did he seem desirous to compensate for this privation by the confidence of friendship he appeared a total stranger to every thing which usually bears the appellation of pleasure his features were scarcely ever relaxed into a smile nor did that air which spoke the unhappiness of his mind at any time forsake them yet his manners were by no means such as denoted moroseness and misanthropy he was compassionate and considerate for others though the stateliness of his carriage and the reserve of his temper were at no time interrupted his appearance and general behaviour might have strongly interested all persons in his favour but the coldness of his address and the impenetrableness of his sentiments seemed to forbid those demonstrations of kindness to which one might otherwise have been prompted such was the general appearance of mr falkland but his disposition was extremely unequal the distemper which afflicted him with incessant gloom had its paroxysms sometimes he was hasty peevish and tyrannical but this proceeded rather from the torment of his mind than an unfeeling disposition and when reflection recurred he appeared willing that the weight of his misfortune should fall wholly upon himself sometimes he entirely lost his selfpossession and his behaviour was changed into frenzy he would strike his forehead his brows became knit his features distorted and his teeth ground one against the other when he felt the approach of these symptoms he would suddenly rise and leaving the occupation whatever it was in which he was engaged hasten into a solitude upon which no person dared to intrude it must not be supposed that the whole of what i am describing was visible to the persons about him nor indeed was i acquainted with it in the extent here stated but after a considerable time and in gradual succession with respect to the domestics in general they saw but little of their master none of them except myself from the nature of my functions and mr collins from the antiquity of his service and the respectableness of his character approached mr falkland but at stated seasons and for a very short interval they knew him only by the benevolence of his actions and the principles of inflexible integrity by which he was ordinarily guided and though they would sometimes indulge their conjectures respecting his singularities they regarded him upon the whole with veneration as a being of a superior order one day when i had been about three months in the service of my patron i went to a closet or small apartment which was separated from the library by a narrow gallery that was lighted by a small window near the roof i had conceived that there was no person in the room and intended only to put any thing in order that i might find out of its place as i opened the door i heard at the same instant a deep groan expressive of intolerable anguish the sound of the door in opening seemed to alarm the person within i heard the lid of a trunk hastily shut and the noise as of fastening a lock i conceived that mr falkland was there and was going instantly to retire but at that moment a voice that seemed supernaturally tremendous exclaimed who is there the voice was mr falklands the sound of it thrilled my very vitals i endeavoured to answer but my speech failed and being incapable of any other reply i instinctively advanced within the door into the room mr falkland was just risen from the floor upon which he had been sitting or kneeling his face betrayed strong symptoms of confusion with a violent effort however these symptoms vanished and instantaneously gave place to a countenance sparkling with rage villain cried he what has brought you here i hesitated a confused and irresolute answer wretch interrupted mr falkland with uncontrollable impatience you want to ruin me you set yourself as a spy upon my actions but bitterly shall you repent your insolence do you think you shall watch my privacies with impunity i attempted to defend myself begone devil rejoined he quit the room or i will trample you into atoms saying this he advanced towards me but i was already sufficiently terrified and vanished in a moment i heard the door shut after me with violence and thus ended this extraordinary scene i saw him again in the evening and he was then tolerably composed his behaviour which was always kind was now doubly attentive and soothing he seemed to have something of which he wished to disburthen his mind but to want words in which to convey it i looked at him with anxiety and affection he made two unsuccessful efforts shook his head and then putting five guineas into my hand pressed it in a manner that i could feel proceeded from a mind pregnant with various emotions though i could not interpret them having done this he seemed immediately to recollect himself and to take refuge in the usual distance and solemnity of his manner i easily understood that secrecy was one of the things expected from me and indeed my mind was too much disposed to meditate upon what i had heard and seen to make it a topic of indiscriminate communication mr collins however and myself happened to sup together that evening which was but seldom the case his avocations obliging him to be much abroad he could not help observing an uncommon dejection and anxiety in my countenance and affectionately enquired into the reason i endeavoured to evade his questions but my youth and ignorance of the world gave me little advantage for that purpose beside this i had been accustomed to view mr collins with considerable attachment and i conceived from the nature of his situation that there could be small impropriety in making him my confident in the present instance i repeated to him minutely every thing that had passed and concluded with a solemn declaration that though treated with caprice i was not anxious for myself no inconvenience or danger should ever lead me to a pusillanimous behaviour and i felt only for my patron who with every advantage for happiness and being in the highest degree worthy of it seemed destined to undergo unmerited distress in answer to my communication mr collins informed me that some incidents of a nature similar to that which i related had fallen under his own knowledge and that from the whole he could not help concluding that our unfortunate patron was at times disordered in his intellects alas continued he it was not always thus ferdinando falkland was once the gayest of the gay not indeed of that frothy sort who excite contempt instead of admiration and whose levity argues thoughtlessness rather than felicity his gaiety was always accompanied with dignity it was the gaiety of the hero and the scholar it was chastened with reflection and sensibility and never lost sight either of good taste or humanity such as it was however it denoted a genuine hilarity of heart imparted an inconceivable brilliancy to his company and conversation and rendered him the perpetual delight of the diversified circles he then willingly frequented you see nothing of him my dear williams but the ruin of that falkland who was courted by sages and adored by the fair his youth distinguished in its outset by the most unusual promise is tarnished his sensibility is shrunk up and withered by events the most disgustful to his feelings his mind was fraught with all the rhapsodies of visionary honour and in his sense nothing but the grosser part the mere shell of falkland was capable of surviving the wound that his pride has sustained these reflections of my friend collins strongly tended to inflame my curiosity and i requested him to enter into a more copious explanation with this request he readily complied as conceiving that whatever delicacy it became him to exercise in ordinary cases it would be out of place in my situation and thinking it not improbable that mr falkland but for the disturbance and inflammation of his mind would be disposed to a similar communication i shall interweave with mr collinss story various information which i afterwards received from other quarters that i may give all possible perspicuity to the series of events to avoid confusion in my narrative i shall drop the person of collins and assume to be myself the historian of our patron to the reader it may appear at first sight as if this detail of the preceding life of mr falkland were foreign to my history alas i know from bitter experience that it is otherwise my heart bleeds at the recollection of his misfortunes as if they were my own how can it fail to do so to his story the whole fortune of my life was linked because he was miserable my happiness my name and my existence have been irretrievably blasted  chapter ii among the favourite authors of his early years were the heroic poets of italy from them he imbibed the love of chivalry and romance he had too much good sense to regret the times of charlemagne and arthur but while his imagination was purged by a certain infusion of philosophy he conceived that there was in the manners depicted by these celebrated poets something to imitate as well as something to avoid he believed that nothing was so well calculated to make men delicate gallant and humane as a temper perpetually alive to the sentiments of birth and honour the opinions he entertained upon these topics were illustrated in his conduct which was assiduously conformed to the model of heroism that his fancy suggested with these sentiments he set out upon his travels at the age at which the grand tour is usually made and they were rather confirmed than shaken by the adventures that befel him by inclination he was led to make his longest stay in italy and here he fell into company with several young noblemen whose studies and principles were congenial to his own by them he was assiduously courted and treated with the most distinguished applause they were delighted to meet with a foreigner who had imbibed all the peculiarities of the most liberal and honourable among themselves nor was he less favoured and admired by the softer sex though his stature was small his person had an air of uncommon dignity his dignity was then heightened by certain additions which were afterwards obliteratedâ€”an expression of frankness ingenuity and unreserve and a spirit of the most ardent enthusiasm perhaps no englishman was ever in an equal degree idolised by the inhabitants of italy it was not possible for him to have drunk so deeply of the fountain of chivalry without being engaged occasionally in affairs of honour all of which were terminated in a manner that would not have disgraced the chevalier bayard himself in italy the young men of rank divide themselves into two classesâ€”those who adhere to the pure principles of ancient gallantry and those who being actuated by the same acute sense of injury and insult accustom themselves to the employment of hired bravoes as their instruments of vengeance the whole difference indeed consists in the precarious application of a generally received distinction the most generous italian conceives that there are certain persons whom it would be contamination for him to call into the open field he nevertheless believes that an indignity cannot be expiated but with blood and is persuaded that the life of a man is a trifling consideration in comparison of the indemnification to be made to his injured honour there is therefore scarcely any italian that would upon some occasions scruple assassination men of spirit among them notwithstanding the prejudices of their education cannot fail to have a secret conviction of its baseness and will be desirous of extending as far as possible the cartel of honour real or affected arrogance teaches others to regard almost the whole species as their inferiors and of consequence incites them to gratify their vengeance without danger to their persons mr falkland met with some of these but his undaunted spirit and resolute temper gave him a decisive advantage even in such perilous rencounters one instance among many of his manner of conducting himself among this proud and highspirited people it may be proper to relate mr falkland is the principal agent in my history and mr falkland in the autumn and decay of his vigour such as i found him cannot be completely understood without a knowledge of his previous character as it was in all the gloss of youth yet unassailed by adversity and unbroken in upon by anguish or remorse at rome he was received with particular distinction at the house of marquis pisani who had an only daughter the heir of his immense fortune and the admiration of all the young nobility of that metropolis lady lucretia pisani was tall of a dignified form and uncommonly beautiful she was not deficient in amiable qualities but her soul was haughty and her carriage not unfrequently contemptuous her pride was nourished by the consciousness of her charms by her elevated rank and the universal adoration she was accustomed to receive among her numerous lovers count malvesi was the individual most favoured by her father nor did his addresses seem indifferent to her the count was a man of considerable accomplishments and of great integrity and benevolence of disposition but he was too ardent a lover to be able always to preserve the affability of his temper the admirers whose addresses were a source of gratification to his mistress were a perpetual uneasiness to him placing his whole happiness in the possession of this imperious beauty the most trifling circumstances were capable of alarming him for the security of his pretensions but most of all he was jealous of the english cavalier marquis pisani who had spent many years in france was by no means partial to the suspicious precautions of italian fathers and indulged his daughter in considerable freedoms his house and his daughter within certain judicious restraints were open to the resort of male visitants but above all mr falkland as a foreigner and a person little likely to form pretensions to the hand of lucretia was received upon a footing of great familiarity the lady herself conscious of innocence entertained no scruple about trifles and acted with the confidence and frankness of one who is superior to suspicion mr falkland after a residence of several weeks at rome proceeded to naples meanwhile certain incidents occurred that delayed the intended nuptials of the heiress of pisani when he returned to rome count malvesi was absent lady lucretia who had been considerably amused before with the conversation of mr falkland and who had an active and enquiring mind had conceived in the interval between his first and second residence at rome a desire to be acquainted with the english language inspired by the lively and ardent encomiums of our best authors that she had heard from their countryman she had provided herself with the usual materials for that purpose and had made some progress during his absence but upon his return she was forward to make use of the opportunity which if missed might never occur again with equal advantage of reading select passages of our poets with an englishman of uncommon taste and capacity this proposal necessarily led to a more frequent intercourse when count malvesi returned he found mr falkland established almost as an inmate of the pisani palace his mind could not fail to be struck with the criticalness of the situation he was perhaps secretly conscious that the qualifications of the englishman were superior to his own and he trembled for the progress that each party might have made in the affection of the other even before they were aware of the danger he believed that the match was in every respect such as to flatter the ambition of mr falkland and he was stung even to madness by the idea of being deprived of the object dearest to his heart by this tramontane upstart he had however sufficient discretion first to demand an explanation of lady lucretia she in the gaiety of her heart trifled with his anxiety his patience was already exhausted and he proceeded in his expostulation in language that she was by no means prepared to endure with apathy lady lucretia had always been accustomed to deference and submission and having got over something like terror that was at first inspired by the imperious manner in which she was now catechised her next feeling was that of the warmest resentment she disdained to satisfy so insolent a questioner and even indulged herself in certain oblique hints calculated to strengthen his suspicions for some time she described his folly and presumption in terms of the most ludicrous sarcasm and then suddenly changing her style bid him never let her see him more except upon the footing of the most distant acquaintance as she was determined never again to subject herself to so unworthy a treatment she was happy that he had at length disclosed to her his true character and would know how to profit of her present experience to avoid a repetition of the same danger all this passed in the full career of passion on both sides and lady lucretia had no time to reflect upon what might be the consequence of thus exasperating her lover count malvesi left her in all the torments of frenzy he believed that this was a premeditated scene to find a pretence for breaking off an engagement that was already all but concluded or rather his mind was racked with a thousand conjectures he alternately thought that the injustice might be hers or his own and he quarrelled with lady lucretia himself and the whole world in this temper he hastened to the hotel of the english cavalier the season of expostulation was now over and he found himself irresistibly impelled to justify his precipitation with the lady by taking for granted that the subject of his suspicion was beyond the reach of doubt mr falkland was at home the first words of the count were an abrupt accusation of duplicity in the affair of lady lucretia and a challenge the englishman had an unaffected esteem for malvesi who was in reality a man of considerable merit and who had been one of mr falklands earliest italian acquaintance they having originally met at milan but more than this the possible consequence of a duel in the present instance burst upon his mind he had the warmest admiration for lady lucretia though his feelings were not those of a lover and he knew that however her haughtiness might endeavour to disguise it she was impressed with a tender regard for count malvesi he could not bear to think that any misconduct of his should interrupt the prospects of so deserving a pair guided by these sentiments he endeavoured to expostulate with the italian but his attempts were ineffectual his antagonist was drunk with choler and would not listen to a word that tended to check the impetuosity of his thoughts he traversed the room with perturbed steps and even foamed with anguish and fury mr falkland finding that all was to no purpose told the count that if he would return tomorrow at the same hour he would attend him to any scene of action he should think proper to select from count malvesi mr falkland immediately proceeded to the palace of pisani here he found considerable difficulty in appeasing the indignation of lady lucretia his ideas of honour would by no means allow him to win her to his purpose by disclosing the cartel he had received otherwise that disclosure would immediately have operated as the strongest motive that could have been offered to this disdainful beauty but though she dreaded such an event the vague apprehension was not strong enough to induce her instantly to surrender all the stateliness of her resentment mr falkland however drew so interesting a picture of the disturbance of count malvesis mind and accounted in so flattering a manner for the abruptness of his conduct that this together with the arguments he adduced completed the conquest of lady lucretias resentment having thus far accomplished his purpose he proceeded to disclose to her every thing that had passed the next day count malvesi appeared punctual to his appointment at mr falklands hotel mr falkland came to the door to receive him but requested him to enter the house for a moment as he had still an affair of three minutes to despatch they proceeded to a parlour here mr falkland left him and presently returned leading in lady lucretia herself adorned in all her charms and those charms heightened upon the present occasion by a consciousness of the spirited and generous condescension she was exerting mr falkland led her up to the astonished count and she gently laying her hand upon the arm of her lover exclaimed with the most attractive grace will you allow me to retract the precipitate haughtiness into which i was betrayed the enraptured count scarcely able to believe his senses threw himself upon his knees before her and stammered out his reply signifying that the precipitation had been all his own that he only had any forgiveness to demand and though they might pardon he could never pardon himself for the sacrilege he had committed against her and this godlike englishman as soon as the first tumults of his joy had subsided mr falkland addressed him thusâ€” count malvesi i feel the utmost pleasure in having thus by peaceful means disarmed your resentment and effected your happiness but i must confess you put me to a severe trial my temper is not less impetuous and fiery than your own and it is not at all times that i should have been thus able to subdue it but i considered that in reality the original blame was mine though your suspicion was groundless it was not absurd we have been trifling too much in the face of danger i ought not under the present weakness of our nature and forms of society to have been so assiduous in my attendance upon this enchanting woman it would have been little wonder if having so many opportunities and playing the preceptor with her as i have done i had been entangled before i was aware and harboured a wish which i might not afterwards have had courage to subdue i owed you an atonement for this imprudence but the laws of honour are in the utmost degree rigid and there was reason to fear that however anxious i were to be your friend i might be obliged to be your murderer fortunately the reputation of my courage is sufficiently established not to expose it to any impeachment by my declining your present defiance it was lucky however that in our interview of yesterday you found me alone and that accident by that means threw the management of the affair into my disposal if the transaction should become known the conclusion will now become known along with the provocation and i am satisfied but if the challenge had been public the proofs i had formerly given of courage would not have excused my present moderation and though desirous to have avoided the combat it would not have been in my power let us hence each of us learn to avoid haste and indiscretion the consequences of which may be inexpiable but with blood and may heaven bless you in a consort of whom i deem you every way worthy i have already said that this was by no means the only instance in the course of his travels in which mr falkland acquitted himself in the most brilliant manner as a man of gallantry and virtue he continued abroad during several years every one of which brought some fresh accession to the estimation in which he was held as well as to his own impatience of stain or dishonour at length he thought proper to return to england with the intention of spending the rest of his days at the residence of his ancestors  chapter iii from the moment he entered upon the execution of this purpose dictated as it probably was by an unaffected principle of duty his misfortunes took their commencement all i have further to state of his history is the uninterrupted persecution of a malignant destiny a series of adventures that seemed to take their rise in various accidents but pointing to one termination him they overwhelmed with an anguish he was of all others least qualified to bear and these waters of bitterness extending beyond him poured their deadly venom upon others i being myself the most unfortunate of their victims the person in whom these calamities originated was mr falklands nearest neighbour a man of estate equal to his own by name barnabas tyrrel this man one might at first have supposed of all others least qualified from instruction or inclined by the habits of his life to disturb the enjoyments of a mind so richly endowed as that of mr falkland mr tyrrel might have passed for a true model of the english squire he was early left under the tuition of his mother a woman of narrow capacity and who had no other child the only remaining member of the family it may be necessary to notice was miss emily melville the orphan daughter of mr tyrrels paternal aunt who now resided in the family mansion and was wholly dependent on the benevolence of its proprietors mrs tyrrel appeared to think that there was nothing in the world so precious as her hopeful barnabas every thing must give way to his accommodation and advantage every one must yield the most servile obedience to his commands he must not be teased or restricted by any forms of instruction and of consequence his proficiency even in the arts of writing and reading was extremely slender from his birth he was muscular and sturdy and confined to the ruelle of his mother he made much such a figure as the whelplion that a barbarian might have given for a lapdog to his mistress but he soon broke loose from these trammels and formed an acquaintance with the groom and the gamekeeper under their instruction he proved as ready a scholar as he had been indocile and restive to the pedant who held the office of his tutor it was now evident that his small proficiency in literature was by no means to be ascribed to want of capacity he discovered no contemptible sagacity and quickwittedness in the science of horseflesh and was eminently expert in the arts of shooting fishing and hunting nor did he confine himself to these but added the theory and practice of boxing cudgel play and quarterstaff these exercises added tenfold robustness and vigour to his former qualifications his stature when grown was somewhat more than five feet ten inches in height and his form might have been selected by a painter as a model for that hero of antiquity whose prowess consisted in felling an ox with his fist and devouring him at a meal conscious of his advantage in this respect he was insupportably arrogant tyrannical to his inferiors and insolent to his equals the activity of his mind being diverted from the genuine field of utility and distinction showed itself in the rude tricks of an overgrown lubber here as in all his other qualifications he rose above his competitors and if it had been possible to overlook the callous and unrelenting disposition which they manifested one could scarcely have denied his applause to the invention these freaks displayed and the rough sarcastic wit with which they were accompanied mr tyrrel was by no means inclined to permit these extraordinary merits to rust in oblivion there was a weekly assembly at the nearest markettown the resort of all the rural gentry here he had hitherto figured to the greatest advantage as grand master of the coterie no one having an equal share of opulence and the majority though still pretending to the rank of gentry greatly his inferior in this essential article the young men in this circle looked up to this insolent bashaw with timid respect conscious of the comparative eminence that unquestionably belonged to the powers of his mind and he well knew how to maintain his rank with an inflexible hand frequently indeed he relaxed his features and assumed a temporary appearance of affableness and familiarity but they found by experience that if any one encouraged by his condescension forgot the deference which mr tyrrel considered as his due he was soon taught to repent his presumption it was a tiger that thought proper to toy with a mouse the little animal every moment in danger of being crushed by the fangs of his ferocious associate as mr tyrrel had considerable copiousness of speech and a rich but undisciplined imagination he was always sure of an audience his neighbours crowded round and joined in the ready laugh partly from obsequiousness and partly from unfeigned admiration it frequently happened however that in the midst of his good humour a characteristic refinement of tyranny would suggest itself to his mind when his subjects encouraged by his familiarity had discarded their precaution the wayward fit would seize him a sudden cloud overspread his brow his voice transform from the pleasant to the terrible and a quarrel of a straw immediately ensue with the first man whose face he did not like the pleasure that resulted to others from the exuberant sallies of his imagination was therefore not unalloyed with sudden qualms of apprehension and terror it may be believed that this despotism did not gain its final ascendancy without being contested in the outset but all opposition was quelled with a high hand by this rural antaeus by the ascendancy of his fortune and his character among his neighbours he always reduced his adversary to the necessity of encountering him at his own weapons and did not dismiss him without making him feel his presumption through every joint in his frame the tyranny of mr tyrrel would not have been so patiently endured had not his colloquial accomplishments perpetually come in aid of that authority which his rank and prowess originally obtained the situation of our squire with the fair was still more enviable than that which he maintained among persons of his own sex every mother taught her daughter to consider the hand of mr tyrrel as the highest object of her ambition every daughter regarded his athletic form and his acknowledged prowess with a favourable eye a form eminently athletic is perhaps always well proportioned and one of the qualifications that women are early taught to look for in the male sex is that of a protector as no man was adventurous enough to contest his superiority so scarcely any woman in this provincial circle would have scrupled to prefer his addresses to those of any other admirer his boisterous wit had peculiar charms for them and there was no spectacle more flattering to their vanity than seeing this hercules exchange his club for a distaff it was pleasing to them to consider that the fangs of this wild beast the very idea of which inspired trepidation into the boldest hearts might be played with by them with the utmost security such was the rival that fortune in her caprice had reserved for the accomplished falkland this untamed though not undiscerning brute was found capable of destroying the prospects of a man the most eminently qualified to enjoy and to communicate happiness the feud that sprung up between them was nourished by concurring circumstances till it attained a magnitude difficult to be paralleled and because they regarded each other with a deadly hatred i have become an object of misery and abhorrence the arrival of mr falkland gave an alarming shock to the authority of mr tyrrel in the village assembly and in all scenes of indiscriminate resort his disposition by no means inclined him to withhold himself from scenes of fashionable amusement and he and his competitor were like two stars fated never to appear at once above the horizon the advantages mr falkland possessed in the comparison are palpable and had it been otherwise the subjects of his rural neighbour were sufficiently disposed to revolt against his merciless dominion they had hitherto submitted from fear and not from love and if they had not rebelled it was only for want of a leader even the ladies regarded mr falkland with particular complacence his polished manners were peculiarly in harmony with feminine delicacy the sallies of his wit were far beyond those of mr tyrrel in variety and vigour in addition to which they had the advantage of having their spontaneous exuberance guided and restrained by the sagacity of a cultivated mind the graces of his person were enhanced by the elegance of his deportment and the benevolence and liberality of his temper were upon all occasions conspicuous it was common indeed to mr tyrrel together with mr falkland to be little accessible to sentiments of awkwardness and confusion but for this mr tyrrel was indebted to a selfsatisfied effrontery and a boisterous and overbearing elocution by which he was accustomed to discomfit his assailants while mr falkland with great ingenuity and candour of mind was enabled by his extensive knowledge of the world and acquaintance with his own resources to perceive almost instantaneously the proceeding it most became him to adopt mr tyrrel contemplated the progress of his rival with uneasiness and aversion he often commented upon it to his particular confidents as a thing altogether inconceivable mr falkland he described as an animal that was beneath contempt diminutive and dwarfish in his form he wanted to set up a new standard of human nature adapted to his miserable condition he wished to persuade people that the human species were made to be nailed to a chair and to pore over books he would have them exchange those robust exercises which make us joyous in the performance and vigorous in the consequences for the wise labour of scratching our heads for a rhyme and counting our fingers for a verse monkeys were as good men as these a nation of such animals would have no chance with a single regiment of the old english votaries of beef and pudding he never saw any thing come of learning but to make people foppish and impertinent and a sensible man would not wish a worse calamity to the enemies of his nation than to see them run mad after such pernicious absurdities it was impossible that people could seriously feel any liking for such a ridiculous piece of goods as this outlandish foreignmade englishman but he knew very well how it was it was a miserable piece of mummery that was played only in spite of him but god for ever blast his soul if he were not bitterly revenged upon them all if such were the sentiments of mr tyrrel his patience found ample exercise in the language which was held by the rest of his neighbours on the same subject while he saw nothing in mr falkland but matter of contempt they appeared to be never weary of recounting his praises such dignity such affability so perpetual an attention to the happiness of others such delicacy of sentiment and expression learned without ostentation refined without foppery elegant without effeminacy perpetually anxious to prevent his superiority from being painfully felt it was so much the more certainly felt to be real and excited congratulation instead of envy in the spectator it is scarcely necessary to remark that the revolution of sentiment in this rural vicinity belongs to one of the most obvious features of the human mind the rudest exhibition of art is at first admired till a nobler is presented and we are taught to wonder at the facility with which before we had been satisfied mr tyrrel thought there would be no end to the commendation and expected when their common acquaintance would fall down and adore the intruder the most inadvertent expression of applause inflicted upon him the torment of demons he writhed with agony his features became distorted and his looks inspired terror such suffering would probably have soured the kindest temper what must have been its effect upon mr tyrrels always fierce unrelenting and abrupt the advantages of mr falkland seemed by no means to diminish with their novelty every new sufferer from mr tyrrels tyranny immediately went over to the standard of his adversary the ladies though treated by their rustic swain with more gentleness than the men were occasionally exposed to his capriciousness and insolence they could not help remarking the contrast between these two leaders in the fields of chivalry the one of whom paid no attention to any ones pleasure but his own while the other seemed all goodhumour and benevolence it was in vain that mr tyrrel endeavoured to restrain the ruggedness of his character his motive was impatience his thoughts were gloomy and his courtship was like the pawings of an elephant it appeared as if his temper had been more human while he indulged in its free bent than now that he sullenly endeavoured to put fetters upon its excesses among the ladies of the villageassembly already mentioned there was none that seemed to engage more of the kindness of mr tyrrel than miss hardingham she was also one of the few that had not yet gone over to the enemy either because she really preferred the gentleman who was her oldest acquaintance or that she conceived from calculation this conduct best adapted to insure her success in a husband one day however she thought proper probably only by way of experiment to show mr tyrrel that she could engage in hostilities if he should at any time give her sufficient provocation she so adjusted her manoeuvres as to be engaged by mr falkland as his partner for the dance of the evening though without the smallest intention on the part of that gentleman who was unpardonably deficient in the sciences of anecdote and matchmaking of giving offence to his country neighbour though the manners of mr falkland were condescending and attentive his hours of retirement were principally occupied in contemplations too dignified for scandal and too large for the altercations of a vestry or the politics of an electionborough a short time before the dances began mr tyrrel went up to his fair inamorata and entered into some trifling conversation with her to fill up the time as intending in a few minutes to lead her forward to the field he had accustomed himself to neglect the ceremony of soliciting beforehand a promise in his favour as not supposing it possible that any one would dare dispute his behests and had it been otherwise he would have thought the formality unnecessary in this case his general preference to miss hardingham being notorious while he was thus engaged mr falkland came up mr tyrrel always regarded him with aversion and loathing mr falkland however slided in a graceful and unaffected manner into the conversation already begun and the animated ingenuousness of his manner was such as might for the time have disarmed the devil of his malice mr tyrrel probably conceived that his accosting miss hardingham was an accidental piece of general ceremony and expected every moment when he would withdraw to another part of the room the company now began to be in motion for the dance and mr falkland signified as much to miss hardingham sir interrupted mr tyrrel abruptly that lady is my partnerâ€”i believe not sir that lady has been so obliging as to accept my invitationâ€”i tell you sir no sir i have an interest in that ladys affections and i will suffer no man to intrude upon my claimsâ€”the ladys affections are not the subject of the present questionâ€”sir it is to no purpose to parley make room sirâ€”mr falkland gently repelled his antagonist mr tyrrel returned he with some firmness let us have no altercation in this business the master of the ceremonies is the proper person to decide in a difference of this sort if we cannot adjust it we can neither of us intend to exhibit our valour before the ladies and shall therefore cheerfully submit to his verdictâ€”damn me sir if i understandâ€” softly mr tyrrel i intended you no offence but sir no man shall prevent my asserting that to which i have once acquired a claim mr falkland uttered these words with the most unruffled temper in the world the tone in which he spoke had acquired elevation but neither roughness nor impatience there was a fascination in his manner that made the ferociousness of his antagonist subside into impotence miss hardingham had begun to repent of her experiment but her alarm was speedily quieted by the dignified composure of her new partner mr tyrrel walked away without answering a word he muttered curses as he went which the laws of honour did not oblige mr falkland to overhear and which indeed it would have been no easy task to have overheard with accuracy mr tyrrel would not perhaps have so easily given up his point had not his own good sense presently taught him that however eager he might be for revenge this was not the ground he should desire to occupy but though he could not openly resent this rebellion against his authority he brooded over it in the recesses of a malignant mind and it was evident enough that he was accumulating materials for a bitter account to which he trusted his adversary should one day be brought  chapter iv this was only one out of innumerable instances that every day seemed to multiply of petty mortifications which mr tyrrel was destined to endure on the part of mr falkland in all of them mr falkland conducted himself with such unaffected propriety as perpetually to add to the stock of his reputation the more mr tyrrel struggled with his misfortune the more conspicuous and inveterate it became a thousand times he cursed his stars which took as he apprehended a malicious pleasure in making mr falkland at every turn the instrument of his humiliation smarting under a succession of untoward events he appeared to feel in the most exquisite manner the distinctions paid to his adversary even in those points in which he had not the slightest pretensions an instance of this now occurred mr clare a poet whose works have done immortal honour to the country that produced him had lately retired after a life spent in the sublimest efforts of genius to enjoy the produce of his economy and the reputation he had acquired in this very neighbourhood such an inmate was looked up to by the country gentlemen with a degree of adoration they felt a conscious pride in recollecting that the boast of england was a native of their vicinity and they were by no means deficient in gratitude when they saw him who had left them an adventurer return into the midst of them in the close of his days crowned with honours and opulence the reader is acquainted with his works he has probably dwelt upon them with transport and i need not remind him of their excellence but he is perhaps a stranger to his personal qualifications he does not know that his productions were scarcely more admirable than his conversation in company he seemed to be the only person ignorant of the greatness of his fame to the world his writings will long remain a kind of specimen of what the human mind is capable of performing but no man perceived their defects so acutely as he or saw so distinctly how much yet remained to be effected he alone appeared to look upon his works with superiority and indifference one of the features that most eminently distinguished him was a perpetual suavity of manners a comprehensiveness of mind that regarded the errors of others without a particle of resentment and made it impossible for any one to be his enemy he pointed out to men their mistakes with frankness and unreserve his remonstrances produced astonishment and conviction but without uneasiness in the party to whom they were addressed they felt the instrument that was employed to correct their irregularities but it never mangled what it was intended to heal such were the moral qualities that distinguished him among his acquaintance the intellectual accomplishments he exhibited were principally a tranquil and mild enthusiasm and a richness of conception which dictated spontaneously to his tongue and flowed with so much ease that it was only by retrospect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been presented mr clare certainly found few men in this remote situation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amusements it has been among the weaknesses of great men to fly to solitude and converse with woods and groves rather than with a circle of strong and comprehensive minds like their own from the moment of mr falklands arrival in the neighbourhood mr clare distinguished him in the most flattering manner to so penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient observation to discover the merits and defects of any character that presented itself the materials of his judgment had long since been accumulated and at the close of so illustrious a life he might almost be said to see through nature at a glance what wonder that he took some interest in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own but to mr tyrrels diseased imagination every distinction bestowed on his neighbour seemed to be expressly intended as an insult to him on the other hand mr clare though gentle and benevolent in his remonstrances to a degree that made the taking offence impossible was by no means parsimonious of praise or slow to make use of the deference that was paid him for the purpose of procuring justice to merit it happened at one of those public meetings at which mr falkland and mr tyrrel were present that the conversation in one of the most numerous sets into which the company was broken turned upon the poetical talents of the former a lady who was present and was distinguished for the acuteness of her understanding said she had been favoured with a sight of a poem he had just written entitled an ode to the genius of chivalry which appeared to her of exquisite merit the curiosity of the company was immediately excited and the lady added she had a copy in her pocket which was much at their service provided its being thus produced would not be disagreeable to the author the whole circle immediately entreated mr falkland to comply with their wishes and mr clare who was one of the company enforced their petition nothing gave this gentleman so much pleasure as to have an opportunity of witnessing and doing justice to the exhibition of intellectual excellence mr falkland had no false modesty or affectation and therefore readily yielded his consent mr tyrrel accidentally sat at the extremity of this circle it cannot be supposed that the turn the conversation had taken was by any means agreeable to him he appeared to wish to withdraw himself but there seemed to be some unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place and made him consent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared for him the poem was read to the rest of the company by mr clare whose elocution was scarcely inferior to his other accomplishments simplicity discrimination and energy constantly attended him in the act of reading and it is not easy to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of those who had the good fortune to be his auditors the beauties of mr falklands poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage the successive passions of the author were communicated to the hearer what was impetuous and what was solemn were delivered with a responsive feeling and a flowing and unlaboured tone the pictures conjured up by the creative fancy of the poet were placed full to view at one time overwhelming the soul with superstitious awe and at another transporting it with luxuriant beauty the character of the hearers upon this occasion has already been described they were for the most part plain unlettered and of little refinement poetry in general they read when read at all from the mere force of imitation and with few sensations of pleasure but this poem had a peculiar vein of glowing inspiration this very poem would probably have been seen by many of them with little effect but the accents of mr clare carried it home to the heart he ended and as the countenances of his auditors had before sympathised with the passions of the composition so now they emulated each other in declaring their approbation their sensations were of a sort to which they were little accustomed one spoke and another followed by a sort of uncontrollable impulse and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more singular and remarkable but what was least to be endured was the behaviour of mr clare he returned the manuscript to the lady from whom he had received it and then addressing mr falkland said with emphasis and animation ha this is as it should be it is of the right stamp i have seen too many hard essays strained from the labour of a pedant and pastoral ditties distressed in lack of a meaning they are such as you sir that we want do not forget however that the muse was not given to add refinements to idleness but for the highest and most invaluable purposes act up to the magnitude of your destiny a moment after mr clare quitted his seat and with mr falkland and two or three more withdrew as soon as they were gone mr tyrrel edged further into the circle he had sat silent so long that he seemed ready to burst with gall and indignation mighty pretty verses said he half talking to himself and not addressing any particular person why ay the verses are well enough damnation i should like to know what a shipload of such stuff is good for why surely said the lady who had introduced mr falklands ode on the present occasion you must allow that poetry is an agreeable and elegant amusement elegant quothawhy look at this falkland a puny bit of a thing in the devils name madam do you think he would write poetry if he could do any thing better the conversation did not stop here the lady expostulated several other persons fresh from the sensation they had felt contributed their share mr tyrrel grew more violent in his invectives and found ease in uttering them the persons who were able in any degree to check his vehemence were withdrawn one speaker after another shrunk back into silence too timid to oppose or too indolent to contend with the fierceness of his passion he found the appearance of his old ascendancy but he felt its deceitfulness and uncertainty and was gloomily dissatisfied in his return from this assembly he was accompanied by a young man whom similitude of manners had rendered one of his principal confidents and whose road home was in part the same as his own one might have thought that mr tyrrel had sufficiently vented his spleen in the dialogue he had just been holding but he was unable to dismiss from his recollection the anguish he had endured damn falkland said he what a pitiful scoundrel is here to make all this bustle about but women and fools always will be fools there is no help for that those that set them on have most to answer for and most of all mr clare he is a man that ought to know something of the world and past being duped by gewgaws and tinsel he seemed too to have some notion of things i should not have suspected him of hallooing to a cry of mongrels without honesty or reason but the world is all alike those that seem better than their neighbours are only more artful they mean the same thing though they take a different road he deceived me for a while but it is all out now they are the makers of the mischief fools might blunder but they would not persist if people that ought to set them right did not encourage them to go wrong a few days after this adventure mr tyrrel was surprised to receive a visit from mr falkland mr falkland proceeded without ceremony to explain the motive of his coming mr tyrrel said he i am come to have an amicable explanation with you explanation what is my offence none in the world sir and for that reason i conceive this the fittest time to come to a right understanding you are in a devil of a hurry sir are you clear that this haste will not mar instead of make an understanding i think i am sir i have great faith in the purity of my intentions and i will not doubt when you perceive the view with which i come that you will willingly cooperate with it mayhap mr falkland we may not agree about that one man thinks one way and another man thinks another mayhap i do not think i have any great reason to be pleased with you already it may be so i cannot however charge myself with having given you reason to be displeased well sir you have no right to put me out of humour with myself if you come to play upon me and try what sort of a fellow you shall have to deal with damn me if you shall have any reason to hug yourself upon the experiment nothing sir is more easy for us than to quarrel if you desire that there is no fear that you will find opportunities damn me sir if i do not believe you are come to bully me mr tyrrel sirâ€”have a care of what sirdo you threaten me damn my soul who are you what do you come here for the fieriness of mr tyrrel brought mr falkland to his recollection i am wrong said he i confess it i came for purposes of peace with that view i have taken the liberty to visit you whatever therefore might be my feelings upon another occasion i am bound to suppress them now howell sir and what have you further to offer mr tyrrel proceeded mr falkland you will readily imagine that the cause that brought me was not a slight one i would not have troubled you with a visit but for important reasons my coming is a pledge how deeply i am myself impressed with what i have to communicate we are in a critical situation we are upon the brink of a whirlpool which if once it get hold of us will render all further deliberation impotent an unfortunate jealousy seems to have insinuated itself between us which i would willingly remove and i come to ask your assistance we are both of us nice of temper we are both apt to kindle and warm of resentment precaution in this stage can be dishonourable to neither the time may come when we shall wish we had employed it and find it too late why should we be enemies our tastes are different our pursuits need not interfere we both of us amply possess the means of happiness we may be respected by all and spend a long life of tranquillity and enjoyment will it be wise in us to exchange this prospect for the fruits of strife a strife between persons with our peculiarities and our weaknesses includes consequences that i shudder to think of i fear sir that it is pregnant with death at least to one of us and with misfortune and remorse to the survivor upon my soul you are a strange man why trouble me with your prophecies and forebodings because it is necessary to your happiness because it becomes me to tell you of our danger now rather than wait till my character will allow this tranquillity no longer by quarrelling we shall but imitate the great mass of mankind who could easily quarrel in our place let us do better let us show that we have the magnanimity to contemn petty misunderstandings by thus judging we shall do ourselves most substantial honour by a contrary conduct we shall merely present a comedy for the amusement of our acquaintance do you think so there may be something in that damn me if i consent to be the jest of any man living you are right mr tyrrel let us each act in the manner best calculated to excite respect we neither of us wish to change roads let us each suffer the other to pursue his own track unmolested be this our compact and by mutual forbearance let us preserve mutual peace saying this mr falkland offered his hand to mr tyrrel in token of fellowship but the gesture was too significant the wayward rustic who seemed to have been somewhat impressed by what had preceded taken as he now was by surprise shrunk back mr falkland was again ready to take fire upon this new slight but he checked himself all this is very unaccountable cried mr tyrrel what the devil can have made you so forward if you had not some sly purpose to answer by which i am to be overreached my purpose replied mr falkland is a manly and an honest purpose why should you refuse a proposition dictated by reason and an equal regard to the interest of each mr tyrrel had had an opportunity for pause and fell back into his habitual character well sir in all this i must own there is some frankness now i will return you like for like it is no matter how i came by it my temper is rough and will not be controlled mayhap you may think it is a weakness but i do not desire to see it altered till you came i found myself very well i liked my neighbours and my neighbours humoured me but now the case is entirely altered and as long as i cannot stir abroad without meeting with some mortification in which you are directly or remotely concerned i am determined to hate you now sir if you will only go out of the county or the kingdom to the devil if you please so as i may never hear of you any more i will promise never to quarrel with you as long as i live your rhymes and your rebusses your quirks and your conundrums may then be every thing that is grand for what i care mr tyrrel be reasonable might not i as well desire you to leave the county as you desire me i come to you not as to a master but an equal in the society of men we must have something to endure as well as to enjoy no man must think that the world was made for him let us take things as we find them and accommodate ourselves as we can to unavoidable circumstances true sir all this is fine talking but i return to my text we are as god made us i am neither a philosopher nor a poet to set out upon a wildgoose chase of making myself a different man from what you find me as for consequences what must be must be as we brew we must bake and so do you see i shall not trouble myself about what is to be but stand up to it with a stout heart when it comes only this i can tell you that as long as i find you thrust into my dish every day i shall hate you as bad as senna and valerian and damn me if i do not think i hate you the more for coming today in this pragmatical way when nobody sent for you on purpose to show how much wiser you are than all the world besides mr tyrrel i have done i foresaw consequences and came as a friend i had hoped that by mutual explanation we should have come to a better understanding i am disappointed but perhaps when you coolly reflect on what has passed you will give me credit for my intentions and think that my proposal was not an unreasonable one having said this mr falkland departed through the interview he no doubt conducted himself in a way that did him peculiar credit yet the warmth of his temper could not be entirely suppressed and even when he was most exemplary there was an apparent loftiness in his manner that was calculated to irritate and the very grandeur with which he suppressed his passions operated indirectly as a taunt to his opponent the interview was prompted by the noblest sentiments but it unquestionably served to widen the breach it was intended to heal for mr tyrrel he had recourse to his old expedient and unburthened the tumult of his thoughts to his confidential friend this cried he is a new artifice of the fellow to prove his imagined superiority we knew well enough that he had the gift of the gab to be sure if the world were to be governed by words he would be in the right box oh yes he had it all hollow but what signifies prating business must be done in another guess way than that i wonder what possessed me that i did not kick him but that is all to come this is only a new debt added to the score which he shall one day richly pay this falkland haunts me like a demon i cannot wake but i think of him i cannot sleep but i see him he poisons all my pleasures i should be glad to see him torn with tenterhooks and to grind his heartstrings with my teeth i shall know no joy till i see him ruined there may be some things right about him but he is my perpetual torment the thought of him hangs like a dead weight upon my heart and i have a right to shake it off does he think i will feel all that i endure for nothing in spite of the acerbity of mr tyrrels feelings it is probable however he did some justice to his rival he regarded him indeed with added dislike but he no longer regarded him as a despicable foe he avoided his encounter he forbore to treat him with random hostility he seemed to lie in wait for his victim and to collect his venom for a mortal assault  chapter v it was not long after that a malignant distemper broke out in the neighbourhood which proved fatal to many of the inhabitants and was of unexampled rapidity in its effects one of the first persons that was seized with it was mr clare it may be conceived what grief and alarm this incident spread through the vicinity mr clare was considered by them as something more than mortal the equanimity of his behaviour his unassuming carriage his exuberant benevolence and goodness of heart joined with his talents his inoffensive wit and the comprehensiveness of his intelligence made him the idol of all that knew him in the scene of his rural retreat at least he had no enemy all mourned the danger that now threatened him he appeared to have had the prospect of long life and of going down to his grave full of years and of honour perhaps these appearances were deceitful perhaps the intellectual efforts he had made which were occasionally more sudden violent and unintermitted than a strict regard to health would have dictated had laid the seed of future disease but a sanguine observer would infallibly have predicted that his temperate habits activity of mind and unabated cheerfulness would be able even to keep death at bay for a time and baffle the attacks of distemper provided their approach were not uncommonly rapid and violent the general affliction therefore was doubly pungent upon the present occasion but no one was so much affected as mr falkland perhaps no man so well understood the value of the life that was now at stake he immediately hastened to the spot but he found some difficulty in gaining admission mr clare aware of the infectious nature of his disease had given directions that as few persons as possible should approach him mr falkland sent up his name he was told that he was included in the general orders he was not however of a temper to be easily repulsed he persisted with obstinacy and at length carried his point being only reminded in the first instance to employ those precautions which experience has proved most effectual for counteracting infection he found mr clare in his bedchamber but not in bed he was sitting in his nightgown at a bureau near the window his appearance was composed and cheerful but death was in his countenance i had a great inclination falkland said he not to have suffered you to come in and yet there is not a person in the world it could give me more pleasure to see but upon second thoughts i believe there are few people that could run into a danger of this kind with a better prospect of escaping in your case at least the garrison will not i trust be taken through the treachery of the commander i cannot tell how it is that i who can preach wisdom to you have myself been caught but do not be discouraged by my example i had no notice of my danger or i would have acquitted myself better mr falkland having once established himself in the apartment of his friend would upon no terms consent to retire mr clare considered that there was perhaps less danger in this choice than in the frequent change from the extremes of a pure to a tainted air and desisted from expostulation falkland said he when you came in i had just finished making my will i was not pleased with what i had formerly drawn up upon that subject and i did not choose in my present situation to call in an attorney in fact it would be strange if a man of sense with pure and direct intentions should not be able to perform such a function for himself mr clare continued to act in the same easy and disengaged manner as in perfect health to judge from the cheerfulness of his tone and the firmness of his manner the thought would never once have occurred that he was dying he walked he reasoned he jested in a way that argued the most perfect selfpossession but his appearance changed perceptibly for the worse every quarter of an hour mr falkland kept his eye perpetually fixed upon him with mingled sentiments of anxiety and admiration falkland said he after having appeared for a short period absorbed in thought i feel that i am dying this is a strange distemper of mine yesterday i seemed in perfect health and tomorrow i shall be an insensible corpse how curious is the line that separates life and death to mortal men to be at one moment active gay penetrating with stores of knowledge at ones command capable of delighting instructing and animating mankind and the next lifeless and loathsome an incumbrance upon the face of the earth such is the history of many men and such will be mine i feel as if i had yet much to do in the world but it will not be i must be contented with what is past it is in vain that i muster all my spirits to my heart the enemy is too mighty and too merciless for me he will not give me time so much as to breathe these things are not yet at least in our power they are parts of a great series that is perpetually flowing the general welfare the great business of the universe will go on though i bear no further share in promoting it that task is reserved for younger strengths for you falkland and such as you we should be contemptible indeed if the prospect of human improvement did not yield us a pure and perfect delight independently of the question of our existing to partake of it mankind would have little to envy to future ages if they had all enjoyed a serenity as perfect as mine has been for the latter half of my existence mr clare sat up through the whole day indulging himself in easy and cheerful exertions which were perhaps better calculated to refresh and invigorate the frame than if he had sought repose in its direct form now and then he was visited with a sudden pang but it was no sooner felt than he seemed to rise above it and smiled at the impotence of these attacks they might destroy him but they could not disturb three or four times he was bedewed with profuse sweats and these again were succeeded by an extreme dryness and burning heat of the skin he was next covered with small livid spots symptoms of shivering followed but these he drove away with a determined resolution he then became tranquil and composed and after some time decided to go to bed it being already night falkland said he pressing his hand the task of dying is not so difficult as some imagine when one looks back from the brink of it one wonders that so total a subversion can take place at so easy a price he had now been some time in bed and as every thing was still mr falkland hoped that he slept but in that he was mistaken presently mr clare threw back the curtain and looked in the countenance of his friend i cannot sleep said he no if i could sleep it would be the same thing as to recover and i am destined to have the worst in this battle falkland i have been thinking about you i do not know any one whose future usefulness i contemplate with greater hope take care of yourself do not let the world be defrauded of your virtues i am acquainted with your weakness as well as your strength you have an impetuosity and an impatience of imagined dishonour that if once set wrong may make you as eminently mischievous as you will otherwise be useful think seriously of exterminating this error but if i cannot in the brief expostulation my present situation will allow produce this desirable change in you there is at least one thing i can do i can put you upon your guard against a mischief i foresee to be imminent beware of mr tyrrel do not commit the mistake of despising him as an unequal opponent petty causes may produce great mischiefs mr tyrrel is boisterous rugged and unfeeling and you are too passionate too acutely sensible of injury it would be truly to be lamented if a man so inferior so utterly unworthy to be compared with you should be capable of changing your whole history into misery and guilt i have a painful presentiment upon my heart as if something dreadful would reach you from that quarter think of this i exact no promise from you i would not shackle you with the fetters of superstition i would have you governed by justice and reason mr falkland was deeply affected with this expostulation his sense of the generous attention of mr clare at such a moment was so great as almost to deprive him of utterance he spoke in short sentences and with visible effort i will behave better replied he never fear me your admonitions shall not be thrown away upon me mr clare adverted to another subject i have made you my executor you will not refuse me this last office of friendship it is but a short time that i have had the happiness of knowing you but in that short time i have examined you well and seen you thoroughly do not disappoint the sanguine hope i have entertained i have left some legacies my former connections while i lived amidst the busy haunts of men as many of them as were intimate are all of them dear to me i have not had time to summon them about me upon the present occasion nor did i desire it the remembrances of me will i hope answer a better purpose than such as are usually thought of on similar occasions mr clare having thus unburthened his mind spoke no more for several hours towards morning mr falkland quietly withdrew the curtain and looked at the dying man his eyes were open and were now gently turned towards his young friend his countenance was sunk and of a deathlike appearance i hope you are better said falkland in a half whisper as if afraid of disturbing him mr clare drew his hand from the bedclothes and stretched it forward mr falkland advanced and took hold of it much better said mr clare in a voice inward and hardly articulate the struggle is now over i have finished my part farewell remember these were his last words he lived still a few hours his lips were sometimes seen to move he expired without a groan mr falkland had witnessed the scene with much anxiety his hopes of a favourable crisis and his fear of disturbing the last moments of his friend had held him dumb for the last half hour he had stood up with his eyes intently fixed upon mr clare he witnessed the last gasp the last little convulsive motion of the frame he continued to look he sometimes imagined that he saw life renewed at length he could deceive himself no longer and exclaimed with a distracted accent and is this all he would have thrown himself upon the body of his friend the attendants withheld and would have forced him into another apartment but he struggled from them and hung fondly over the bed is this the end of genius virtue and excellence is the luminary of the world thus for ever gone oh yesterday yesterday clare why could not i have died in your stead dreadful moment irreparable loss lost in the very maturity and vigour of his mind cut off from a usefulness ten thousand times greater than any he had already exhibited oh his was a mind to have instructed sages and guided the moral world this is all we have left of him the eloquence of those lips is gone the incessant activity of that heart is still the best and wisest of men is gone and the world is insensible of its loss mr tyrrel heard the intelligence of mr clares death with emotion but of a different kind he avowed that he had not forgiven him his partial attachment to mr falkland and therefore could not recall his remembrance with kindness but if he could have overlooked his past injustice sufficient care it seems was taken to keep alive his resentment falkland forsooth attended him on his deathbed as if nobody else were worthy of his confidential communications but what was worst of all was this executorship in every thing this pragmatical rascal throws me behind contemptible wretch that has nothing of the man about him must he perpetually trample upon his betters is every body incapable of saying what kind of stuff a man is made of caught with mere outside choosing the flimsy before the substantial and upon his deathbed too mr tyrrel with his uncultivated brutality mixed as usually happens certain rude notions of religion sure the sense of his situation might have shamed him poor wretch his soul has a great deal to answer for he has made my pillow uneasy and whatever may be the consequences it is he we have to thank for them the death of mr clare removed the person who could most effectually have moderated the animosities of the contending parties and took away the great operative check upon the excesses of mr tyrrel this rustic tyrant had been held in involuntary restraint by the intellectual ascendancy of his celebrated neighbour and notwithstanding the general ferocity of his temper he did not appear till lately to have entertained a hatred against him in the short time that had elapsed from the period in which mr clare had fixed his residence in the neighbourhood to that of the arrival of mr falkland from the continent the conduct of mr tyrrel had even shown tokens of improvement he would indeed have been better satisfied not to have had even this intruder into a circle where he had been accustomed to reign but with mr clare he could have no rivalship the venerable character of mr clare disposed him to submission this great man seemed to have survived all the acrimony of contention and all the jealous subtleties of a mistaken honour the effects of mr clares suavity however so far as related to mr tyrrel had been in a certain degree suspended by considerations of rivalship between this gentleman and mr falkland and now that the influence of mr clares presence and virtues was entirely removed mr tyrrels temper broke out into more criminal excesses than ever the added gloom which mr falklands neighbourhood inspired overflowed upon all his connections and the new examples of his sullenness and tyranny which every day afforded reflected back upon this accumulated and portentous feud  chapter vi the consequences of all this speedily manifested themselves the very next incident in the story was in some degree decisive of the catastrophe hitherto i have spoken only of preliminary matters seemingly unconnected with each other though leading to that state of mind in both parties which had such fatal effects but all that remains is rapid and tremendous the deathdealing mischief advances with an accelerated motion appearing to defy human wisdom and strength to obstruct its operation the vices of mr tyrrel in their present state of augmentation were peculiarly exercised upon his domestics and dependents but the principal sufferer was the young lady mentioned on a former occasion the orphan daughter of his fathers sister miss melvilles mother had married imprudently or rather unfortunately against the consent of her relations all of whom had agreed to withdraw their countenance from her in consequence of that precipitate step her husband had turned out to be no better than an adventurer had spent her fortune which in consequence of the irreconcilableness of her family was less than he expected and had broken her heart her infant daughter was left without any resource in this situation the representations of the people with whom she happened to be placed prevailed upon mrs tyrrel the mother of the squire to receive her into her family in equity perhaps she was entitled to that portion of fortune which her mother had forfeited by her imprudence and which had gone to swell the property of the male representative but this idea had never entered into the conceptions of either mother or son mrs tyrrel conceived that she performed an act of the most exalted benevolence in admitting miss emily into a sort of equivocal situation which was neither precisely that of a domestic nor yet marked with the treatment that might seem due to one of the family she had not however at first been sensible of all the mortifications that might have been expected from her condition mrs tyrrel though proud and imperious was not illnatured the female who lived in the family in the capacity of housekeeper was a person who had seen better days and whose disposition was extremely upright and amiable she early contracted a friendship for the little emily who was indeed for the most part committed to her care emily on her side fully repaid the affection of her instructress and learned with great docility the few accomplishments mrs jakeman was able to communicate but most of all she imbibed her cheerful and artless temper that extracted the agreeable and encouraging from all events and prompted her to communicate her sentiments which were never of the cynical cast without modification or disguise besides the advantages emily derived from mrs jakeman she was permitted to take lessons from the masters who were employed at tyrrel place for the instruction of her cousin and indeed as the young gentleman was most frequently indisposed to attend to them they would commonly have had nothing to do had it not been for the fortunate presence of miss melville mrs tyrrel therefore encouraged the studies of emily on that score in addition to which she imagined that this living exhibition of instruction might operate as an indirect allurement to her darling barnabas the only species of motive she would suffer to be presented force she absolutely forbade and of the intrinsic allurements of literature and knowledge she had no conception emily as she grew up displayed an uncommon degree of sensibility which under her circumstances would have been a source of perpetual dissatisfaction had it not been qualified with an extreme sweetness and easiness of temper she was far from being entitled to the appellation of a beauty her person was petite and trivial her complexion savoured of the brunette and her face was marked with the smallpox sufficiently to destroy its evenness and polish though not enough to destroy its expression but though her appearance was not beautiful it did not fail to be in a high degree engaging her complexion was at once healthful and delicate her long dark eyebrows adapted themselves with facility to the various conceptions of her mind and her looks bore the united impression of an active discernment and a goodhumoured frankness the instruction she had received as it was entirely of a casual nature exempted her from the evils of untutored ignorance but not from a sort of native wildness arguing a mind incapable of guile itself or of suspecting it in others she amused without seeming conscious of the refined sense which her observations contained or rather having never been debauched with applause she set light by her own qualifications and talked from the pure gaiety of a youthful heart acting upon the stores of a just understanding and not with any expectation of being distinguished and admired the death of her aunt made very little change in her situation this prudent lady who would have thought it little less than sacrilege to have considered miss melville as a branch of the stock of the tyrrels took no more notice of her in her will than barely putting her down for one hundred pounds in a catalogue of legacies to her servants she had never been admitted into the intimacy and confidence of mrs tyrrel and the young squire now that she was left under his sole protection seemed inclined to treat her with even more liberality than his mother had done he had seen her grow up under his eye and therefore though there were but six years difference in their ages he felt a kind of paternal interest in her welfare habit had rendered her in a manner necessary to him and in every recess from the occupations of the field and the pleasures of the table he found himself solitary and forlorn without the society of miss melville nearness of kindred and emilys want of personal beauty prevented him from ever looking on her with the eyes of desire her accomplishments were chiefly of the customary and superficial kind dancing and music her skill in the first led him sometimes to indulge her with a vacant corner in his carriage when he went to the neighbouring assembly and in whatever light he might himself think proper to regard her he would have imagined his chambermaid introduced by him entitled to an undoubted place in the most splendid circle her musical talents were frequently employed for his amusement she had the honour occasionally of playing him to sleep after the fatigues of the chase and as he had some relish for harmonious sounds she was frequently able to soothe him by their means from the perturbations of which his gloomy disposition was so eminently a slave upon the whole she might be considered as in some sort his favourite she was the mediator to whom his tenants and domestics when they had incurred his displeasure were accustomed to apply the privileged companion that could approach this lion with impunity in the midst of his roarings she spoke to him without fear her solicitations were always goodnatured and disinterested and when he repulsed her he disarmed himself of half his terrors and was contented to smile at her presumption such had been for some years the situation of miss melville its precariousness had been beguiled by the uncommon forbearance with which she was treated by her savage protector but his disposition always brutal had acquired a gradual accession of ferocity since the settlement of mr falkland in his neighbourhood he now frequently forgot the gentleness with which he had been accustomed to treat his goodnatured cousin her little playful arts were not always successful in softening his rage and he would sometimes turn upon her blandishments with an impatient sternness that made her tremble the careless ease of her disposition however soon effaced these impressions and she fell without variation into her old habits a circumstance occurred about this time which gave peculiar strength to the acrimony of mr tyrrel and ultimately brought to its close the felicity that miss melville in spite of the frowns of fortune had hitherto enjoyed emily was exactly seventeen when mr falkland returned from the continent at this age she was peculiarly susceptible of the charms of beauty grace and moral excellence when united in a person of the other sex she was imprudent precisely because her own heart was incapable of guile she had never yet felt the sting of the poverty to which she was condemned and had not reflected on the insuperable distance that custom has placed between the opulent and the poorer classes of the community she beheld mr falkland whenever he was thrown in her way at any of the public meetings with admiration and without having precisely explained to herself the sentiments she indulged her eyes followed him through all the changes of the scene with eagerness and impatience she did not see him as the rest of the assembly did born to one of the amplest estates in the county and qualified to assert his title to the richest heiress she thought only of falkland with those advantages which were most intimately his own and of which no persecution of adverse fortune had the ability to deprive him in a word she was transported when he was present he was the perpetual subject of her reveries and her dreams but his image excited no sentiment in her mind beyond that of the immediate pleasure she took in his idea the notice mr falkland bestowed on her in return appeared sufficiently encouraging to a mind so full of prepossession as that of emily there was a particular complacency in his looks when directed towards her he had said in a company of which one of the persons present repeated his remarks to miss melville that she appeared to him amiable and interesting that he felt for her unprovided and destitute situation and that he should have been glad to be more particular in his attention to her had he not been apprehensive of doing her a prejudice in the suspicious mind of mr tyrrel all this she considered as the ravishing condescension of a superior nature for if she did not recollect with sufficient assiduity his gifts of fortune she was on the other hand filled with reverence for his unrivalled accomplishments but while she thus seemingly disclaimed all comparison between mr falkland and herself she probably cherished a confused feeling as if some event that was yet in the womb of fate might reconcile things apparently the most incompatible fraught with these prepossessions the civilities that had once or twice occurred in the bustle of a public circle the restoring her fan which she had dropped or the disembarrassing her of an empty teacup made her heart palpitate and gave birth to the wildest chimeras in her deluded imagination about this time an event happened that helped to give a precise determination to the fluctuations of miss melvilles mind one evening a short time after the death of mr clare mr falkland had been at the house of his deceased friend in his quality of executor and by some accidents of little intrinsic importance had been detained three or four hours later than he expected he did not set out upon his return till two oclock in the morning at this time in a situation so remote from the metropolis every thing is as silent as it would be in a region wholly uninhabited the moon shone bright and the objects around being marked with strong variations of light and shade gave a kind of sacred solemnity to the scene mr falkland had taken collins with him the business to be settled at mr clares being in some respects similar to that to which this faithful domestic had been accustomed in the routine of his ordinary service they had entered into some conversation for mr falkland was not then in the habit of obliging the persons about him by formality and reserve to recollect who he was the attractive solemnity of the scene made him break off the talk somewhat abruptly that he might enjoy it without interruption they had not ridden far before a hollow wind seemed to rise at a distance and they could hear the hoarse roarings of the sea presently the sky on one side assumed the appearance of a reddish brown and a sudden angle in the road placed this phenomenon directly before them as they proceeded it became more distinct and it was at length sufficiently visible that it was occasioned by a fire mr falkland put spurs to his horse and as they approached the object presented every instant a more alarming appearance the flames ascended with fierceness they embraced a large portion of the horizon and as they carried up with them numerous little fragments of the materials that fed them impregnated with fire and of an extremely bright and luminous colour they presented some feeble image of the tremendous eruption of a volcano the flames proceeded from a village directly in their road there were eight or ten houses already on fire and the whole seemed to be threatened with immediate destruction the inhabitants were in the utmost consternation having had no previous experience of a similar calamity they conveyed with haste their moveables and furniture into the adjoining fields when any of them had effected this as far as it could be attempted with safety they were unable to conceive any further remedy but stood wringing their hands and contemplating the ravages of the fire in an agony of powerless despair the water that could be procured in any mode practised in that place was but as a drop contending with an element in arms the wind in the mean time was rising and the flames spread with more and more rapidity mr falkland contemplated this scene for a few moments as if ruminating with himself as to what could be done he then directed some of the country people about him to pull down a house next to one that was wholly on fire but which itself was yet untouched they seemed astonished at a direction which implied a voluntary destruction of property and considered the task as too much in the heart of the danger to be undertaken observing that they were motionless he dismounted from his horse and called upon them in an authoritative voice to follow him he ascended the house in an instant and presently appeared upon the top of it as if in the midst of the flames having with the assistance of two or three of the persons that followed him most closely and who by this time had supplied themselves with whatever tools came next to hand loosened the support of a stack of chimneys he pushed them headlong into the midst of the fire he passed and repassed along the roof and having set people to work in all parts descended in order to see what could be done in any other quarter at this moment an elderly woman burst from the midst of a house in flames the utmost consternation was painted in her looks and as soon as she could recollect herself enough to have a proper idea of her situation the subject of her anxiety seemed in an instant to be totally changed where is my child cried she and cast an anxious and piercing look among the surrounding crowd oh she is lost she is in the midst of flames save her save her my child she filled the air with heartrending shrieks she turned towards the house the people that were near endeavoured to prevent her but she shook them off in a moment she entered the passage viewed the hideous ruin and was then going to plunge into the blazing staircase mr falkland saw pursued and seized her by the arm it was mrs jakeman stop he cried with a voice of grand yet benevolent authority remain you in the street i will seek and will save her mrs jakeman obeyed he charged the persons who were near to detain her he enquired which was the apartment of emily mrs jakeman was upon a visit to a sister who lived in the village and had brought emily along with her mr falkland ascended a neighbouring house and entered that in which emily was by a window in the roof he found her already awaked from her sleep and becoming sensible of her danger she had that instant wrapped a loose gown round her such is the almost irresistible result of feminine habits but having done this she examined the surrounding objects with the wildness of despair mr falkland entered the chamber she flew into his arms with the rapidity of lightning she embraced and clung to him with an impulse that did not wait to consult the dictates of her understanding her emotions were indescribable in a few short moments she had lived an age in love in two minutes mr falkland was again in the street with his lovely halfnaked burthen in his arms having restored her to her affectionate protector snatched from the immediate grasp of death from which if he had not none would have delivered her he returned to his former task by his presence of mind by his indefatigable humanity and incessant exertions he saved three fourths of the village from destruction the conflagration being at length abated he sought again mrs jakeman and emily who by this time had obtained a substitute for the garments she had lost in the fire he displayed the tenderest solicitude for the young ladys safety and directed collins to go with as much speed as he could and send his chariot to attend her more than an hour elapsed in this interval miss melville had never seen so much of mr falkland upon any former occasion and the spectacle of such humanity delicacy firmness and justice in the form of man as he crowded into this small space was altogether new to her and in the highest degree fascinating she had a confused feeling as if there had been something indecorous in her behaviour or appearance when mr falkland had appeared to her relief and this combined with her other emotions to render the whole critical and intoxicating emily no sooner arrived at the family mansion than mr tyrrel ran out to receive her he had just heard of the melancholy accident that had taken place at the village and was terrified for the safety of his goodhumoured cousin he displayed those unpremeditated emotions which are common to almost every individual of the human race he was greatly shocked at the suspicion that emily might possibly have become the victim of a catastrophe which had thus broken out in the dead of night his sensations were of the most pleasing sort when he folded her in his arms and fearful apprehension was instantaneously converted into joyous certainty emily no sooner entered under the well known roof than her spirits were brisk and her tongue incessant in describing her danger and her deliverance mr tyrrel had formerly been tortured with the innocent eulogiums she pronounced of mr falkland but these were lameness itself compared with the rich and various eloquence that now flowed from her lips love had not the same effect upon her especially at the present moment which it would have had upon a person instructed to feign a blush and inured to a consciousness of wrong she described his activity and resources the promptitude with which every thing was conceived and the cautious but daring wisdom with which it was executed all was fairyland and enchantment in the tenour of her artless tale you saw a beneficent genius surveying and controlling the whole but could have no notion of any human means by which his purposes were effected mr tyrrel listened for a while to these innocent effusions with patience he could even bear to hear the man applauded by whom he had just obtained so considerable a benefit but the theme by amplification became nauseous and he at length with some roughness put an end to the tale probably upon recollection it appeared still more insolent and intolerable than while it was passing the sensation of gratitude wore off but the hyperbolical praise that had been bestowed still haunted his memory and sounded in his earâ€”emily had entered into the confederacy that disturbed his repose for herself she was wholly unconscious of offence and upon every occasion quoted mr falkland as the model of elegant manners and true wisdom she was a total stranger to dissimulation and she could not conceive that any one beheld the subject of her admiration with less partiality than herself her artless love became more fervent than ever she flattered herself that nothing less than a reciprocal passion could have prompted mr falkland to the desperate attempt of saving her from the flames and she trusted that this passion would speedily declare itself as well as induce the object of her adoration to overlook her comparative unworthiness mr tyrrel endeavoured at first with some moderation to check miss melville in her applauses and to convince her by various tokens that the subject was disagreeable to him he was accustomed to treat her with kindness emily on her part was disposed to yield an unreluctant obedience and therefore it was not difficult to restrain her but upon the very next occasion her favourite topic would force its way to her lips her obedience was the acquiescence of a frank and benevolent heart but it was the most difficult thing in the world to inspire her with fear conscious herself that she would not hurt a worm she could not conceive that any one would harbour cruelty and rancour against her her temper had preserved her from obstinate contention with the persons under whose protection she was placed and as her compliance was unhesitating she had no experience of a severe and rigorous treatment as mr tyrrels objection to the very name of falkland became more palpable and uniform miss melville increased in her precaution she would stop herself in the halfpronounced sentences that were meant to his praise this circumstance had necessarily an ungracious effect it was a cutting satire upon the imbecility of her kinsman upon these occasions she would sometimes venture upon a goodhumoured expostulationâ€”dear sir well i wonder how you can be so illnatured i am sure mr falkland would do you any good office in the worldâ€”till she was checked by some gesture of impatience and fierceness at length she wholly conquered her heedlessness and inattention but it was too late mr tyrrel already suspected the existence of that passion which she had thoughtlessly imbibed his imagination ingenious in torment suggested to him all the different openings in conversation in which she would have introduced the praise of mr falkland had she not been placed under this unnatural restraint her present reserve upon the subject was even more insufferable than her former loquacity all his kindness for this unhappy orphan gradually subsided her partiality for the man who was the object of his unbounded abhorrence appeared to him as the last persecution of a malicious destiny he figured himself as about to be deserted by every creature in human form all men under the influence of a fatal enchantment approving only what was sophisticated and artificial and holding the rude and genuine offspring of nature in mortal antipathy impressed with these gloomy presages he saw miss melville with no sentiments but those of rancorous aversion and accustomed as he was to the uncontrolled indulgence of his propensities he determined to wreak upon her a signal revenge  chapter vii mr tyrrel consulted his old confident respecting the plan he should pursue who sympathising as he did in the brutality and insolence of his friend had no idea that an insignificant girl without either wealth or beauty ought to be allowed for a moment to stand in the way of the gratifications of a man of mr tyrrels importance the first idea of her now unrelenting kinsman was to thrust her from his doors and leave her to seek her bread as she could but he was conscious that this proceeding would involve him in considerable obloquy and he at length fixed upon a scheme which at the same time that he believed it would sufficiently shelter his reputation would much more certainly secure her mortification and punishment for this purpose he fixed upon a young man of twenty the son of one grimes who occupied a small farm the property of his confident this fellow he resolved to impose as a husband on miss melville who he shrewdly suspected guided by the tender sentiments she had unfortunately conceived for mr falkland would listen with reluctance to any matrimonial proposal grimes he selected as being in all respects the diametrical reverse of mr falkland he was not precisely a lad of vicious propensities but in an inconceivable degree boorish and uncouth his complexion was scarcely human his features were coarse and strangely discordant and disjointed from each other his lips were thick and the tone of his voice broad and unmodulated his legs were of equal size from one end to the other and his feet misshapen and clumsy he had nothing spiteful or malicious in his disposition but he was a total stranger to tenderness he could not feel for those refinements in others of which he had no experience in himself he was an expert boxer his inclination led him to such amusements as were most boisterous and he delighted in a sort of manual sarcasm which he could not conceive to be very injurious as it left no traces behind it his general manners were noisy and obstreperous inattentive to others and obstinate and unyielding not from any cruelty and ruggedness of temper but from an incapacity to conceive those finer feelings that make so large a part of the history of persons who are cast in a gentler mould such was the uncouth and halfcivilised animal which the industrious malice of mr tyrrel fixed upon as most happily adapted to his purpose emily had hitherto been in an unusual degree exempted from the oppression of despotism her happy insignificance had served her as a protection no one thought it worth his while to fetter her with those numerous petty restrictions with which the daughters of opulence are commonly tormented she had the wildness as well as the delicate frame of the bird that warbles unmolested in its native groves when therefore she heard from her kinsman the proposal of mr grimes for a husband she was for a moment silent with astonishment at so unexpected a suggestion but as soon as she recovered her speech she replied no sir i do not want a husband you do are not you always hankering after the men it is high time you should be settled mr grimes no indeed when i do have a husband it shall not be such a man as mr grimes neither be silent how dare you give yourself such unaccountable liberties lord i wonder what i should do with him you might as well give me your great rough waterdog and bid me make him a silk cushion to lie in my dressingroom besides sir grimes is a common labouring man and i am sure i have always heard my aunt say that ours is a very great family it is a lie our family have you the impudence to think yourself one of our family why sir was not your grandpapa my grandpapa how then can we be of a different family from the strongest reason in the world you are the daughter of a rascally scotchman who spent every shilling of my aunt lucys fortune and left you a beggar you have got an hundred pounds and grimess father promises to give him as much how dare you look down upon your equals indeed sir i am not proud but indeed and indeed i can never love mr grimes i am very happy as i am why should i be married silence your prating grimes will be here this afternoon look that you behave well to him if you do not he will remember and repay when you least like it nay i am sure sirâ€”you are not in earnest not in earnest damn me but we will see that i can tell what you would be at you had rather be mr falklands miss than the wife of a plain downright yeoman but i shall take care of youâ€”ay this comes of indulgence you must be taken down miss you must be taught the difference between highflown notions and realities mayhap you may take it a little in dudgeon or so but never mind that pride always wants a little smarting if you should be brought to shame it is i that shall bear the blame of it the tone in which mr tyrrel spoke was so different from any thing to which miss melville had been accustomed that she felt herself wholly unable to determine what construction to put upon it sometimes she thought he had really formed a plan for imposing upon her a condition that she could not bear so much as to think of but presently she rejected this idea as an unworthy imputation upon her kinsman and concluded that it was only his way and that all he meant was to try her to be resolved however she determined to consult her constant adviser mrs jakeman and accordingly repeated to her what had passed mrs jakeman saw the whole in a very different light from that in which emily had conceived it and trembled for the future peace of her beloved ward lord bless me my dear mamma cried emily this was the appellation she delighted to bestow upon the good housekeeper you cannot think so but i do not care i will never marry grimes happen what will but how will you help yourself my master will oblige you nay now you think you are talking to a child indeed it is i am to have the man not mr tyrrel do you think i will let any body else choose a husband for me i am not such a fool as that neither ah emily you little know the disadvantages of your situation your cousin is a violent man and perhaps will turn you out of doors if you oppose him oh mamma it is very wicked of you to say so i am sure mr tyrrel is a very good man though he be a little cross now and then he knows very well that i am right to have a will of my own in such a thing as this and nobody is punished for doing what is right nobody ought my dear child but there are very wicked and tyrannical men in the world well well i will never believe my cousin is one of these i hope he is not and if he were what then to be sure i should he very sorry to make him angry what then why then my poor emily would be a beggar do you think i could bear to see that no no mr tyrrel has just told me that i have a hundred pounds but if i had no fortune is not that the case with a thousand other folks why should i grieve for what they bear and are merry do not make yourself uneasy mamma i am determined that i will do any thing rather than marry grimes that is what i will mrs jakeman could not bear the uneasy state of suspense in which this conversation left her mind and went immediately to the squire to have her doubts resolved the manner in which she proposed the question sufficiently indicated the judgment she had formed of the match that is true said mr tyrrel i wanted to speak to you about this affair the girl has got unaccountable notions in her head that will be the ruin of her you perhaps can tell where she had them but be that as it will it is high time something should be done the shortest way is the best and to keep things well while they are well in short i am determined she shall marry this lad you do not know any harm of him do you you have a good deal of influence with her and i desire do you see that you will employ it to lead her to her good you had best i can tell you she is a pert vixen by and by she would be a whore and at last no better than a common trull and rot upon a dunghill if i were not at all these pains to save her from destruction i would make her an honest farmers wife and my pretty miss cannot bear the thoughts of it in the afternoon grimes came according to appointment and was left alone with the young lady well miss said he it seems the squire has a mind to make us man and wife for my part i cannot say i should have thought of it but being as how the squire has broke the ice if so be as you like of the match why i am your man speak the word a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse emily was already sufficiently mortified at the unexpected proposal of mr tyrrel she was confounded at the novelty of the situation and still more at the uncultivated rudeness of her lover which even exceeded her expectation this confusion was interpreted by grimes into diffidence come come never be cast down put a good face upon it what though my first sweetheart was bet butterfield but what of that what must be must be grief will never fill the belly she was a fine strapping wench that is the truth of it five foot ten inches and as stout as a trooper oh she would do a power of work up early and down late milked ten cows with her own hands on with her cardinal rode to market between her panniers fair weather and foul hail blow or snow it would have done your heart good to have seen her frostbitten cheeks as red as a beefen from her own orchard ah she was a maid of mettle would romp with the harvestmen slap one upon the back wrestle with another and had a rogues trick and a joke for all round poor girl she broke her neck down stairs at a christening to be sure i shall never meet with her fellow but never you mind that i do not doubt that i shall find more in you upon further acquaintance as coy and bashful as you seem i dare say you are rogue enough at bottom when i have touzled and rumpled you a little we shall see i am no chicken miss whatever you may think i know what is what and can see as far into a millstone as another ay ay you will come to the fish will snap at the bait never doubt it yes yes we shall rub on main well together emily by this time had in some degree mustered up her spirits and began though with hesitation to thank mr grimes for his good opinion but to confess that she could never be brought to favour his addresses she therefore entreated him to desist from all further application this remonstrance on her part would have become more intelligible had it not been for his boisterous manners and extravagant cheerfulness which indisposed him to silence and made him suppose that at half a word he had sufficient intimation of anothers meaning mr tyrrel in the mean time was too impatient not to interrupt the scene before they could have time to proceed far in explanation and he was studious in the sequel to prevent the young folks from being too intimately acquainted with each others inclinations grimes of consequence attributed the reluctance of miss melville to maiden coyness and the skittish shyness of an unbroken filly indeed had it been otherwise it is not probable that it would have made any effectual impression upon him as he was always accustomed to consider women as made for the recreation of the men and to exclaim against the weakness of people who taught them to imagine they were to judge for themselves as the suit proceeded and miss melville saw more of her new admirer her antipathy increased but though her character was unspoiled by those false wants which frequently make people of family miserable while they have every thing that nature requires within their reach yet she had been little used to opposition and was terrified at the growing sternness of her kinsman sometimes she thought of flying from a house which was now become her dungeon but the habits of her youth and her ignorance of the world made her shrink from this project when she contemplated it more nearly mrs jakeman indeed could not think with patience of young grimes as a husband for her darling emily but her prudence determined her to resist with all her might the idea on the part of the young lady of proceeding to extremities she could not believe that mr tyrrel would persist in such an unaccountable persecution and she exhorted miss melville to forget for a moment the unaffected independence of her character and pathetically to deprecate her cousins obstinacy she had great confidence in the ingenuous eloquence of her ward mrs jakeman did not know what was passing in the breast of the tyrant miss melville complied with the suggestion of her mamma one morning immediately after breakfast she went to her harpsichord and played one after another several of those airs that were most the favourites of mr tyrrel mrs jakeman had retired the servants were gone to their respective employments mr tyrrel would have gone also his mind was untuned and he did not take the pleasure he had been accustomed to take in the musical performances of emily but her finger was now more tasteful than common her mind was probably wrought up to a firmer and bolder tone by the recollection of the cause she was going to plead at the same time that it was exempt from those incapacitating tremors which would have been felt by one that dared not look poverty in the face mr tyrrel was unable to leave the apartment sometimes he traversed it with impatient steps then he hung over the poor innocent whose powers were exerted to please him at length he threw himself in a chair opposite with his eyes turned towards emily it was easy to trace the progress of his emotions the furrows into which his countenance was contracted were gradually relaxed his features were brightened into a smile the kindness with which he had upon former occasions contemplated emily seemed to revive in his heart emily watched her opportunity as soon as she had finished one of the pieces she rose and went to mr tyrrel now have not i done it nicely and after this will not you give me a reward a reward ay come here and i will give you a kiss no that is not it and yet you have not kissed me this many a day formerly you said you loved me and called me your emily i am sure you did not love me better than i loved you you have not forgot all the kindness you once had for me added she anxiously forgot no no how can you ask such a question you shall be my dear emily still ah those were happy times she replied a little mournfully do you know cousin i wish i could wake and find that the last monthâ€”only about a monthâ€”was a dream what do you mean by that said mr tyrrel with an altered voice have a care do not put me out of humour do not come with your romantic notions now no no i have no romantic notions in my head i speak of something upon which the happiness of my life depends i see what you would be at be silent you know it is to no purpose to plague me with your stubbornness you will not let me be in good humour with you for a moment what my mind is determined upon about grimes all the world shall not move me to give up dear dear cousin why but consider now grimes is a rough rustic lout like orson in the storybook he wants a wife like himself he would be as uneasy and as much at a loss with me as i with him why should we both of us be forced to do what neither of us is inclined to i cannot think what could ever have put it into your head but now for goodness sake give it up marriage is a serious thing you should not think of joining two people for a whim who are neither of them fit for one another in any respect in the world we should feel mortified and disappointed all our lives month would go after month and year after year and i could never hope to be my own but by the death of a person i ought to love i am sure sir you cannot mean me all this harm what have i done that i should deserve to have you for an enemy i am not your enemy i tell you that it is necessary to put you out of harms way but if i were your enemy i could not be a worse torment to you than you are to me are not you continually singing the praises of falkland are not you in love with falkland that man is a legion of devils to me i might as well have been a beggar i might as well have been a dwarf or a monster time was when i was thought entitled to respect but now debauched by this frenchified rascal they call me rude surly a tyrant it is true that i cannot talk in finical phrases flatter people with hypocritical praise or suppress the real feelings of my mind the scoundrel knows his pitiful advantages and insults me upon them without ceasing he is my rival and my persecutor and at last as if all this were not enough he has found means to spread the pestilence in my own family you whom we took up out of charity the chanceborn brat of a stolen marriage you must turn upon your benefactor and wound me in the point that of all others i could least bear if i were your enemy should not i have reason could i ever inflict upon you such injuries as you have made me suffer and who are you the lives of fifty such cannot atone for an hour of my uneasiness if you were to linger for twenty years upon the rack you would never feel what i have felt but i am your friend i see which way you are going and i am determined to save you from this thief this hypocritical destroyer of us all every moment that the mischief is left to itself it does but make bad worse and i am determined to save you out of hand the angry expostulations of mr tyrrel suggested new ideas to the tender mind of miss melville he had never confessed the emotions of his soul so explicitly before but the tempest of his thoughts suffered him to be no longer master of himself she saw with astonishment that he was the irreconcilable foe of mr falkland whom she had fondly imagined it was the same thing to know and admire and that he harboured a deep and rooted resentment against herself she recoiled without well knowing why before the ferocious passions of her kinsman and was convinced that she had nothing to hope from his implacable temper but her alarm was the prelude of firmness and not of cowardice no sir replied she indeed i will not be driven any way that you happen to like i have been used to obey you and in all that is reasonable i will obey you still but you urge me too far what do you tell me of mr falkland have i ever done any thing to deserve your unkind suspicions i am innocent and will continue innocent mr grimes is well enough and will no doubt find women that like him but he is not fit for me and torture shall not force me to be his wife mr tyrrel was not a little astonished at the spirit which emily displayed upon this occasion he had calculated too securely upon the general mildness and suavity of her disposition he now endeavoured to qualify the harshness of his former sentiments god damn my soul and so you can scold can you you expect every body to turn out of his way and fetch and carry just as you please i could find in my heartâ€”but you know my mind i insist upon it that you let grimes court you and that you lay aside your sulks and give him a fair hearing will you do that if then you persist in your wilfulness why there i suppose is an end of the matter do not think that any body is going to marry you whether you will or no you are no such mighty prize i assure you if you knew your own interest you would be glad to take the young fellow while he is willing miss melville rejoiced in the prospect which the last words of her kinsman afforded her of a termination at no great distance to her present persecutions mrs jakeman to whom she communicated them congratulated emily on the returning moderation and good sense of the squire and herself on her prudence in having urged the young lady to this happy expostulation but their mutual felicitations lasted not long mr tyrrel informed mrs jakeman of the necessity in which he found himself of sending her to a distance upon a business which would not fail to detain her several weeks and though the errand by no means wore an artificial or ambiguous face the two friends drew a melancholy presage from this illtimed separation mrs jakeman in the mean time exhorted her ward to persevere reminded her of the compunction which had already been manifested by her kinsman and encouraged her to hope every thing from her courage and good temper emily on her part though grieved at the absence of her protector and counsellor at so interesting a crisis was unable to suspect mr tyrrel of such a degree either of malice or duplicity as could afford ground for serious alarm she congratulated herself upon her delivery from so alarming a persecution and drew a prognostic of future success from this happy termination of the first serious affair of her life she exchanged a state of fortitude and alarm for her former pleasing dreams respecting mr falkland these she bore without impatience she was even taught by the uncertainty of the event to desire to prolong rather than abridge a situation which might be delusive but which was not without its pleasures  chapter viii nothing could be further from mr tyrrels intention than to suffer his project to be thus terminated no sooner was he freed from the fear of his housekeepers interference than he changed the whole system of his conduct he ordered miss melville to be closely confined to her apartment and deprived of all means of communicating her situation to any one out of his own house he placed over her a female servant in whose discretion he could confide and who having formerly been honoured with the amorous notices of the squire considered the distinctions that were paid to emily at tyrrel place as an usurpation upon her more reasonable claims the squire himself did every thing in his power to blast the young ladys reputation and represented to his attendants these precautions as necessary to prevent her from eloping to his neighbour and plunging herself in total ruin as soon as miss melville had been twentyfour hours in durance and there was some reason to suppose that her spirit might be subdued to the emergency of her situation mr tyrrel thought proper to go to her to explain the grounds of her present treatment and acquaint her with the only means by which she could hope for a change emily no sooner saw him than she turned towards him with an air of greater firmness than perhaps she had ever assumed in her life and accosted him thusâ€” well sir is it you i wanted to see you it seems i am shut up here by your orders what does this mean what right have you to make a prisoner of me what do i owe you your mother left me a hundred pounds have you ever offered to make any addition to my fortune but if you had i do not want it i do not pretend to be better than the children of other poor parents i can maintain myself as they do i prefer liberty to wealth i see you are surprised at the resolution i exert but ought i not to turn again when i am trampled upon i should have left you before now if mrs jakeman had not overpersuaded me and if i had not thought better of you than by your present behaviour i find you deserve but now sir i intend to leave your house this moment and insist upon it that you do not endeavour to prevent me thus saying she rose and went towards the door while mr tyrrel stood thunderstruck at her magnanimity seeing however that she was upon the point of being out of the reach of his power he recovered himself and pulled her back what is in the wind now do you think strumpet that you shall get the better of me by sheer impudence sit down rest you satisfiedso you want to know by what right you are here do you by the right of possession this house is mine and you are in my power there is no mrs jakeman now to spirit you away no nor no falkland to bully for you i have countermined you damn me and blown up your schemes do you think i will be contradicted and opposed for nothing when did you ever know any body resist my will without being made to repent and shall i now be browbeaten by a chittyfaced girlâ€”i have not given you a fortune damn you who brought you up i will make you a bill for clothing and lodging do not you know that every creditor has a right to stop his runaway debtor you may think as you please but here you are till you marry grimes heaven and earth shall not prevent but i will get the better of your obstinacy ungenerous unmerciful man and so it is enough for you that i have nobody to defend me but i am not so helpless as you may imagine you may imprison my body but you cannot conquer my mind marry mr grimes and is this the way to bring me to your purpose every hardship i suffer puts still further distant the end for which i am thus unjustly treated you are not used to have your will contradicted when did i ever contradict it and in a concern that is so completely my own shall my will go for nothing would you lay down this rule for yourself and suffer no other creature to take the benefit of it i want nothing of you how dare you refuse me the privilege of a reasonable being to live unmolested in poverty and innocence what sort of a man do you show yourself you that lay claim to the respect and applause of every one that knows you the spirited reproaches of emily had at first the effect to fill mr tyrrel with astonishment and make him feel abashed and overawed in the presence of this unprotected innocent but his confusion was the result of surprise when the first emotion wore off he cursed himself for being moved by her expostulations and was ten times more exasperated against her for daring to defy his resentment at a time when she had every thing to fear his despotic and unforgiving propensities stimulated him to a degree little short of madness at the same time his habits which were pensive and gloomy led him to meditate a variety of schemes to punish her obstinacy he began to suspect that there was little hope of succeeding by open force and therefore determined to have recourse to treachery he found in grimes an instrument sufficiently adapted to his purpose this fellow without an atom of intentional malice was fitted by the mere coarseness of his perceptions for the perpetration of the greatest injuries he regarded both injury and advantage merely as they related to the gratifications of appetite and considered it an essential in true wisdom to treat with insult the effeminacy of those who suffer themselves to be tormented with ideal misfortunes he believed that no happier destiny could befal a young woman than to be his wife and he conceived that that termination would amply compensate for any calamities she might suppose herself to undergo in the interval he was therefore easily prevailed upon by certain temptations which mr tyrrel knew how to employ to take part in the plot into which miss melville was meant to be betrayed matters being thus prepared mr tyrrel proceeded through the means of the gaoler for the experience he already had of personal discussion did not incline him to repeat his visits to play upon the fears of his prisoner this woman sometimes under the pretence of friendship and sometimes with open malice informed emily from time to time of the preparations that were making for her marriage one day the squire had rode over to look at a neat little farm which was destined for the habitation of the newmarried couple and at another a quantity of live stock and household furniture was procured that every thing might be ready for their reception she then told her of a licence that was bought a parson in readiness and a day fixed for the nuptials when emily endeavoured though with increased misgivings to ridicule these proceedings as absolutely nugatory without her consent her artful gouvernante related several stories of forced marriages and assured her that neither protestations nor silence nor fainting would be of any avail either to suspend the ceremony or to set it aside when performed the situation of miss melville was in an eminent degree pitiable she had no intercourse but with her persecutors she had not a human being with whom to consult who might afford her the smallest degree of consolation and encouragement she had fortitude but it was neither confirmed nor directed by the dictates of experience it could not therefore be expected to be so inflexible as with better information it would no doubt have been found she had a clear and noble spirit but she had some of her sexs errors her mind sunk under the uniform terrors with which she was assailed and her health became visibly impaired her firmness being thus far undermined grimes in pursuance of his instructions took care in his next interview to throw out an insinuation that for his own part he had never cared for the match and since she was so averse to it would be better pleased that it should never take place between one and the other however he was got into a scrape and now he supposed he must marry will he nill he the two squires would infallibly ruin him upon the least appearance of backwardness on his part as they were accustomed to do every inferior that resisted their will emily was rejoiced to find her admirer in so favourable a disposition and earnestly pressed him to give effect to this humane declaration her representations were full of eloquence and energy grimes appeared to be moved at the fervency of her manner but objected the resentment of mr tyrrel and his landlord at length however he suggested a project in consequence of which he might assist her in her escape without its ever coming to their knowledge as indeed there was no likelihood that their suspicions would fix upon him to be sure said he you have refused me in a disdainful sort of a way as a man may say mayhap you thought i was no better an a brute but i bear you no malice and i will show you that i am more kindhearted an you have been willing to think it is a strange sort of a vagary you have taken to stand in your own light and disoblige all your friends but if you are resolute do you see i scorn to be the husband of a lass that is not every bit as willing as i and so i will even help to put you in a condition to follow your own inclinations emily listened to these suggestions at first with eagerness and approbation but her fervency somewhat abated when they came to discuss the minute parts of the undertaking it was necessary as grimes informed her that her escape should be effected in the dead of the night he would conceal himself for that purpose in the garden and be provided with false keys by which to deliver her from her prison these circumstances were by no means adapted to calm her perturbed imagination to throw herself into the arms of the man whose intercourse she was employing every method to avoid and whom under the idea of a partner for life she could least of all men endure was no doubt an extraordinary proceeding the attendant circumstances of darkness and solitude aggravated the picture the situation of tyrrel place was uncommonly lonely it was three miles from the nearest village and not less than seven from that in which mrs jakemans sister resided under whose protection miss melville was desirous of placing herself the ingenuous character of emily did not allow her once to suspect grimes of intending to make an ungenerous and brutal advantage of these circumstances but her mind involuntarily revolted against the idea of committing herself alone to the disposal of a man whom she had lately been accustomed to consider as the instrument of her treacherous relation after having for some time revolved these considerations she thought of the expedient of desiring grimes to engage mrs jakemans sister to wait for her at the outside of the garden but this grimes peremptorily refused he even flew into a passion at the proposal it showed very little gratitude to desire him to disclose to other people his concern in this dangerous affair for his part he was determined in consideration of his own safety never to appear in it to any living soul if miss did not believe him when he made this proposal out of pure goodnature and would not trust him a single inch she might even see to the consequences herself he was resolved to condescend no further to the whims of a person who in her treatment of him had shown herself as proud as lucifer himself emily exerted herself to appease his resentment but all the eloquence of her new confederate could not prevail upon her instantly to give up her objection she desired till the next day to consider of it the day after was fixed by mr tyrrel for the marriage ceremony in the mean time she was pestered with intimations in a thousand forms of the fate that so nearly awaited her the preparations were so continued methodical and regular as to produce in her the most painful and aching anxiety if her heart attained a moments intermission upon the subject her female attendant was sure by some sly hint or sarcastical remark to put a speedy termination to her tranquillity she felt herself as she afterwards remarked alone uninstructed just broken loose as it were from the trammels of infancy without one single creature to concern himself in her fate she who till then never knew an enemy had now for three weeks not seen the glimpse of a human countenance that she had not good reason to consider as wholly estranged to her at least if not unrelentingly bent on her destruction she now for the first time experienced the anguish of never having known her parents and being cast upon the charity of people with whom she had too little equality to hope to receive from them the offices of friendship the succeeding night was filled with the most anxious thoughts when a momentary oblivion stole upon her senses her distempered imagination conjured up a thousand images of violence and falsehood she saw herself in the hands of her determined enemies who did not hesitate by the most daring treachery to complete her ruin her waking thoughts were not more consoling the struggle was too great for her constitution as morning approached she resolved at all hazards to put herself into the hands of grimes this determination was no sooner made than she felt her heart sensibly lightened she could not conceive any evil which could result from this proceeding that deserved to be put in the balance against those which under the roof of her kinsman appeared unavoidable when she communicated her determination to grimes it was not possible to say whether he received pleasure or pain from the intimation he smiled indeed but his smile was accompanied by a certain abrupt ruggedness of countenance so that it might equally well be the smile of sarcasm or of congratulation he however renewed his assurances of fidelity to his engagements and punctuality of execution meanwhile the day was interspersed with nuptial presents and preparations all indicating the firmness as well as security of the directors of the scene emily had hoped that as the crisis approached they might have remitted something of their usual diligence she was resolved in that case if a fair opportunity had offered to give the slip both to her jailors and to her new and reluctantly chosen confederate but though extremely vigilant for that purpose she found the execution of the idea impracticable at length the night so critical to her happiness approached the mind of emily could not fail on this occasion to be extremely agitated she had first exerted all her perspicacity to elude the vigilance of her attendant this insolent and unfeeling tyrant instead of any relentings had only sought to make sport of her anxiety accordingly in one instance she hid herself and suffering emily to suppose that the coast was clear met her at the end of the gallery near the top of the staircase how do you do my dear said she with an insulting tone and so the little dear thought itself cunning enough to outwit me did it oh it was a sly little gipsy go go back love troop emily felt deeply the trick that was played upon her she sighed but disdained to return any answer to this low vulgarity being once more in her chamber she sat down in a chair and remained buried in reverie for more than two hours after this she went to her drawers and turned over in a hurrying confused way her linen and clothes having in her mind the provision it would be necessary to make for her elopement her jailor officiously followed her from place to place and observed what she did for the present in silence it was now the hour of rest good night child said this saucy girl in the act of retiring it is time to lock up for the few next hours the time is your own make the best use of it doee think ee can creep out at the keyhole lovey at eight oclock you see me again and then and then added she clapping her hands it is all over the sun is not surer to rise than you and your honest man to be made one there was something in the tone with which this slut uttered her farewell that suggested the question to emily what does she mean is it possible that she should know what has been planned for the few next hoursâ€”this was the first moment that suspicion had offered itself and its continuance was short with an aching heart she folded up the few necessaries she intended to take with her she instinctively listened with an anxiety that would almost have enabled her to hear the stirring of a leaf from time to time she thought her ear was struck with the sound of feet but the treading if treading it were was so soft that she could never ascertain whether it were a real sound or the mere creature of the fancy then all was still as if the universal motion had been at rest by and by she conceived she overheard a noise as of buzzing and lowmuttered speech her heart palpitated for a second time she began to doubt the honesty of grimes the suggestion was now more anxious than before but it was too late presently she heard the sound of a key in her chamberdoor and the rustic made his appearance she started and cried are we discovered did not i hear you speak grimes advanced on tiptoe with his finger to his lip no no replied he all is safe he took her by the hand led her in silence out of the house and then across the garden emily examined with her eye the doors and passages as they proceeded and looked on all sides with fearful suspicion but every thing was as vacant and still as she herself could have wished grimes opened a backdoor of the garden already unlocked that led into an unfrequented lane there stood two horses ready equipped for the journey and fastened by their bridles to a post not six yards distant from the garden grimes pushed the door after them by gemini said he my heart was in my mouth as i comed along to you i saw mun coachey pop along from the backdoor to the stables he was within a hop step and jump of me but he had a lanthorn in his hand and he did not see me being as i was darkling saying this he assisted miss melville to mount he troubled her little during the route on the contrary he was remarkably silent and contemplative a circumstance by no means disagreeable to emily to whom his conversation had never been acceptable after having proceeded about two miles they turned into a wood through which the road led to the place of their destination the night was extremely dark at the same time that the air was soft and mild it being now the middle of summer under pretence of exploring the way grimes contrived when they had already penetrated into the midst of this gloomy solitude to get his horse abreast with that of miss melville and then suddenly reaching out his hand seized hold of her bridle i think we may as well stop here a bit said he stop exclaimed emily with surprise why should we stop mr grimes what do you mean come come said he never trouble yourself to wonder did you think i were such a goose to take all this trouble merely to gratify your whim i faith nobody shall find me a packhorse to go of other folks errands without knowing a reason why i cannot say that i much minded to have you at first but your ways are enough to stir the blood of my granddad farfetched and dearbought is always relishing your consent was so hard to gain that squire thought it was surest asking in the dark a said however a would have no such doings in his house and so do ye see we are comed here for gods sake mr grimes think what you are about you cannot be base enough to ruin a poor creature who has put herself under your protection ruin no no i will make an honest woman of you when all is done nay none of your airs no tricks upon travellers i have you here as safe as a horse in a pound there is not a house nor a shed within a mile of us and if i miss the opportunity call me spade faith you are a delicate morsel and there is no time to be lost miss melville had but an instant in which to collect her thoughts she felt that there was little hope of softening the obstinate and insensible brute in whose power she was placed but the presence of mind and intrepidity annexed to her character did not now desert her grimes had scarcely finished his harangue when with a strong and unexpected jerk she disengaged the bridle from his grasp and at the same time put her horse upon full speed she had scarcely advanced twice the length of her horse when grimes recovered from his surprise and pursued her inexpressibly mortified at being so easily overreached the sound of his horse behind served but to rouse more completely the mettle of that of emily whether by accident or sagacity the animal pursued without a fault the narrow and winding way and the chase continued the whole length of the wood at the extremity of this wood there was a gate the recollection of this softened a little the cutting disappointment of grimes as he thought himself secure of putting an end by its assistance to the career of emily nor was it very probable that any body would appear to interrupt his designs in such a place and in the dead and silence of the night by the most extraordinary accident however they found a man on horseback in wait at this gate help help exclaimed the affrighted emily thieves murder help the man was mr falkland grimes knew his voice and therefore though he attempted a sort of sullen resistance it was feebly made two other men whom by reason of the darkness he had not at first seen and who were mr falklands servants hearing the bustle of the rencounter and alarmed for the safety of their master rode up and then grimes disappointed at the loss of his gratification and admonished by conscious guilt shrunk from farther parley and rode off in silence it may seem strange that mr falkland should thus a second time have been the saviour of miss melville and that under circumstances the most unexpected and singular but in this instance it is easily to be accounted for he had heard of a man who lurked about this wood for robbery or some other bad design and that it was conjectured this man was hawkins another of the victims of mr tyrrels rural tyranny whom i shall immediately have occasion to introduce mr falklands compassion had already been strongly excited in favour of hawkins he had in vain endeavoured to find him and do him good and he easily conceived that if the conjecture which had been made in this instance proved true he might have it in his power not only to do what he had always intended but further to save from a perilous offence against the laws and society a man who appeared to have strongly imbibed the principles of justice and virtue he took with him two servants because going with the express design of encountering robbers if robbers should be found he believed he should be inexcusable if he did not go provided against possible accidents but he had directed them at the same time that they kept within call to be out of the reach of being seen and it was only the eagerness of their zeal that had brought them up thus early in the present encounter this new adventure promised something extraordinary mr falkland did not immediately recognise miss melville and the person of grimes was that of a total stranger whom he did not recollect to have ever seen but it was easy to understand the merits of the case and the propriety of interfering the resolute manner of mr falkland conjoined with the dread which grimes oppressed with a sense of wrong entertained of the opposition of so elevated a personage speedily put the ravisher to flight emily was left alone with her deliverer he found her much more collected and calm than could reasonably have been expected from a person who had been a moment before in the most alarming situation she told him of the place to which she desired to be conveyed and he immediately undertook to escort her as they went along she recovered that state of mind which inclined her to make a person to whom she had such repeated obligations and who was so eminently the object of her admiration acquainted with the events that had recently befallen her mr falkland listened with eagerness and surprise though he had already known various instances of mr tyrrels mean jealousy and unfeeling tyranny this surpassed them all and he could scarcely credit his ears while he heard the tale his brutal neighbour seemed to realise all that has been told of the passions of fiends miss melville was obliged to repeat in the course of her tale her kinsmans rude accusation against her of entertaining a passion for mr falkland and this she did with the most bewitching simplicity and charming confusion though this part of the tale was a source of real pain to her deliverer yet it is not to be supposed but that the flattering partiality of this unhappy girl increased the interest he felt in her welfare and the indignation he conceived against her infernal kinsman they arrived without accident at the house of the good lady under whose protection emily desired to place herself here mr falkland willingly left her as in a place of security such conspiracies as that of which she was intended to have been the victim depend for their success upon the person against whom they are formed being out of the reach of help and the moment they are detected they are annihilated such reasoning will no doubt be generally found sufficiently solid and it appeared to mr falkland perfectly applicable to the present case but he was mistaken  chapter ix mr falkland had experienced the nullity of all expostulation with mr tyrrel and was therefore content in the present case with confining his attention to the intended victim the indignation with which he thought of his neighbours character was now grown to such a height as to fill him with reluctance to the idea of a voluntary interview there was indeed another affair which had been contemporary with this that had once more brought these mortal enemies into a state of contest and had contributed to raise into a temper little short of madness the already inflamed and corrosive bitterness of mr tyrrel there was a tenant of mr tyrrel one hawkinsâ€”i cannot mention his name without recollecting the painful tragedies that are annexed to it this hawkins had originally been taken up by mr tyrrel with a view of protecting him from the arbitrary proceedings of a neighbouring squire though he had now in his turn become an object of persecution to mr tyrrel himself the first ground of their connection was thisâ€”hawkins beside a farm which he rented under the abovementioned squire had a small freehold estate that he inherited from his father this of course entitled him to a vote in the county elections and a warmly contested election having occurred he was required by his landlord to vote for the candidate in whose favour he had himself engaged hawkins refused to obey the mandate and soon after received notice to quit the farm he at that time rented it happened that mr tyrrel had interested himself strongly in behalf of the opposite candidate and as mr tyrrels estate bordered upon the seat of hawkinss present residence the ejected countryman could think of no better expedient than that of riding over to this gentlemans mansion and relating the case to him mr tyrrel heard him through with attention well friend said he it is very true that i wished mr jackman to carry his election but you know it is usual in these cases for tenants to vote just as their landlords please i do not think proper to encourage rebellionâ€”all that is very right and please you replied hawkins and i would have voted at my landlords bidding for any other man in the kingdom but squire marlow you must know one day his huntsman rode over my fence and so through my best field of standing corn it was not above a dozen yards about if he had kept the cartroad the fellow had served me the same sauce an it please your honour three or four times before so i only asked him what he did that for and whether he had not more conscience than to spoil peoples crops o that fashion presently the squire came up he is but a poor weazenface chicken of a gentleman saving your honours reverence and so he flew into a woundy passion and threatened to horsewhip me i will do as much in reason to pleasure my landlord as arr a tenant he has but i will not give my vote to a man that threatens to horsewhip me and so your honour i and my wife and three children are to be turned out of house and home and what i am to do to maintain them god knows i have been a hardworking man and have always lived well and i do think the case is main hard squire underwood turns me out of my farm and if your honour do not take me in i know none of the neighbouring gentry will for fear as they say of encouraging their own tenants to run rusty too this representation was not without its effect upon mr tyrrel well well man replied he we will see what can be done order and subordination are very good things but people should know how much to require as you tell the story i cannot see that you are greatly to blame marlow is a coxcombical prig that is the truth ont and if a man will expose himself why he must even take what follows i do hate a frenchified fop with all my soul and i cannot say that i am much pleased with my neighbour underwood for taking the part of such a rascal hawkins i think is your name you may call on barnes my steward tomorrow and he shall speak to you while mr tyrrel was speaking he recollected that he had a farm vacant of nearly the same value as that which hawkins at present rented under mr underwood he immediately consulted his steward and finding the thing suitable in every respect hawkins was installed out of hand in the catalogue of mr tyrrels tenants mr underwood extremely resented this proceeding which indeed as being contrary to the understood conventions of the country gentlemen few people but mr tyrrel would have ventured upon there was an end said mr underwood to all regulation if tenants were to be encouraged in such disobedience it was not a question of this or that candidate seeing that any gentleman who was a true friend to his country would rather lose his election than do a thing which if once established into a practice would deprive them for ever of the power of managing any election the labouring people were sturdy and resolute enough of their own accord it became every day more difficult to keep them under any subordination and if the gentlemen were so ill advised as to neglect the public good and encourage them in their insolence there was no foreseeing where it would end mr tyrrel was not of a stamp to be influenced by these remonstrances their general spirit was sufficiently conformable to the sentiments he himself entertained but he was of too vehement a temper to maintain the character of a consistent politician and however wrong his conduct might be he would by no means admit of its being set right by the suggestions of others the more his patronage of hawkins was criticised the more inflexibly he adhered to it and he was at no loss in clubs and other assemblies to overbear and silence if not to confute his censurers beside which hawkins had certain accomplishments which qualified him to be a favourite with mr tyrrel the bluntness of his manner and the ruggedness of his temper gave him some resemblance to his landord and as these qualities were likely to be more frequently exercised on such persons as had incurred mr tyrrels displeasure than upon mr tyrrel himself they were not observed without some degree of complacency in a word he every day received new marks of distinction from his patron and after some time was appointed coadjutor to mr barnes under the denomination of bailiff it was about the same period that he obtained a lease of the farm of which he was tenant mr tyrrel determined as occasion offered to promote every part of the family of this favoured dependent hawkins had a son a lad of seventeen of an agreeable person a ruddy complexion and of quick and lively parts this lad was in an uncommon degree the favourite of his father who seemed to have nothing so much at heart as the future welfare of his son mr tyrrel had noticed him two or three times with approbation and the boy being fond of the sports of the field had occasionally followed the hounds and displayed various instances both of agility and sagacity in presence of the squire one day in particular he exhibited himself with uncommon advantage and mr tyrrel without further delay proposed to his father to take him into his family and make him whipperin to his hounds till he could provide him with some more lucrative appointment in his service this proposal was received by hawkins with various marks of mortification he excused himself with hesitation for not accepting the offered favour said the lad was in many ways useful to him and hoped his honour would not insist upon depriving him of his assistance this apology might perhaps have been sufficient with any other man than mr tyrrel but it was frequently observed of this gentleman that when he had once formed a determination however slight in favour of any measure he was never afterwards known to give it up and that the only effect of opposition was to make him eager and inflexible in pursuit of that to which he had before been nearly indifferent at first he seemed to receive the apology of hawkins with good humour and to see nothing in it but what was reasonable but afterwards every time he saw the boy his desire of retaining him in his service was increased and he more than once repeated to his father the good disposition in which he felt himself towards him at length he observed that the lad was no more to be seen mingling in his favourite sports and he began to suspect that this originated in a determination to thwart him in his projects roused by this suspicion which to a man of mr tyrrels character was not of a nature to brook delay he sent for hawkins to confer with him hawkins said he in a tone of displeasure i am not satisfied with you i have spoken to you two or three times about this lad of yours whom i am desirous of taking into favour what is the reason sir that you seem unthankful and averse to my kindness you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with i shall not be contented when i offer my favours to have them rejected by such fellows as you i made you what you are and if i please can make you more helpless and miserable than you were when i found you have a care an it please your honour said hawkins you have been a very good master to me and i will tell you the whole truth i hope you will na be angry this lad is my favourite my comfort and the stay of my age well and what then is that a reason you should hinder his preferment nay pray your honour hear me i may be very weak for aught i know in this case but i cannot help it my father was a clergyman we have all of us lived in a creditable way and i cannot bear to think that this poor lad of mine should go to service for my part i do not see any good that comes by servants i do not know your honour but i think i should not like my leonard to be such as they god forgive me if i wrong them but this is a very dear case and i cannot bear to risk my poor boys welfare when i can so easily if you please keep him out or harms way at present he is sober and industrious and without being pert or surly knows what is due to him i know your honour that it is main foolish of me to talk to you thus but your honour has been a good master to me and i cannot bear to tell you a lie mr tyrrel had heard the whole of this harangue in silence because he was too much astonished to open his mouth if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet he could not have testified greater surprise he had thought that hawkins was so foolishly fond of his son that he could not bear to trust him out of his presence but had never in the slightest degree suspected what he now found to be the truth oh ho you are a gentleman are you a pretty gentleman truly your father was a clergyman your family is too good to enter into my service why you impudent rascal was it for this that i took you up when mr underwood dismissed you for your insolence to him have i been nursing a viper in my bosom pretty masters manners will be contaminated truly he will not know what is due to him but will be accustomed to obey orders you insufferable villain get out of my sight depend upon it i will have no gentlemen on my estate i will off with them root and branch bag and baggage so do you hear sir come to me tomorrow morning bring your son and ask my pardon or take my word for it i will make you so miserable you shall wish you had never been born this treatment was too much for hawkinss patience there is no need your honour that i should come to you again about this affair i have taken up my determination and no time can make any change in it i am main sorry to displease your worship and i know that you can do me a great deal of mischief but i hope you will not be so hardhearted as to ruin a father only for being fond of his child even if so be that his fondness should make him do a foolish thing but i cannot help it your honour you must do as you please the poorest neger as a man may say has some point that he will not part with i will lose all that i have and go to daylabour and my son too if needs must but i will not make a gentlemans servant of him very well friend very well replied mr tyrrel foaming with rage depend upon it i will remember you your pride shall have a downfal god damn it is it come to this shall a rascal that farms his forty acres pretend to beard the lord of the manor i will tread you into paste let me advise you scoundrel to shut up your house and fly as if the devil was behind you you may think yourself happy if i be not too quick for you yet if you escape in a whole skin i would not suffer such a villain to remain upon my land a day longer if i could gain the indies by it not so fast your honour answered hawkins sturdily i hope you will think better of it and see that i have not been to blame but if you should not there is some harm that you can do me and some harm that you cannot though i am a plain working man your honour do you see yet i am a man still no i have got a lease of my farm and i shall not quit it o thaten i hope there is some law for poor folk as well as for rich mr tyrrel unused to contradiction was provoked beyond bearing at the courage and independent spirit of his retainer there was not a tenant upon his estate or at least not one of hawkinss mediocrity of fortune whom the general policy of landowners and still more the arbitrary and uncontrollable temper of mr tyrrel did not effectually restrain from acts of open defiance excellent upon my soul god damn my blood but you are a rare fellow you have a lease have you you will not quit not you a pretty pass things are come to if a lease can protect such fellows as you against the lord of a manor but you are for a trial of skill oh very well friend very well with all my soul since it is come to that we will show you some pretty sport before we have done but get out of my sight you rascal i have not another word to say to you never darken my doors again hawkins to borrow the language of the world was guilty in this affair of a double imprudence he talked to his landlord in a more peremptory manner than the constitution and practices of this country allow a dependent to assume but above all having been thus hurried away by his resentment he ought to have foreseen the consequences it was mere madness in him to think of contesting with a man of mr tyrrels eminence and fortune it was a fawn contending with a lion nothing could have been more easy to predict than that it was of no avail for him to have right on his side when his adversary had influence and wealth and therefore could so victoriously justify any extravagancies that he might think proper to commit this maxim was completely illustrated in the sequel wealth and despotism easily know how to engage those laws as the coadjutors of their oppression which were perhaps at first intended witless and miserable precaution for the safeguards of the poor from this moment mr tyrrel was bent upon hawkinss destruction and he left no means unemployed that could either harass or injure the object of his persecution he deprived him of his appointment of bailiff and directed barnes and his other dependents to do him ill offices upon all occasions mr tyrrel by the tenure of his manor was impropriator of the great tithes and this circumstance afforded him frequent opportunities of petty altercation the land of one part of hawkinss farm though covered with corn was lower than the rest and consequently exposed to occasional inundations from a river by which it was bounded mr tyrrel had a dam belonging to this river privately cut about a fortnight before the season of harvest and laid the whole under water he ordered his servants to pull away the fences of the higher ground during the night and to turn in his cattle to the utter destruction of the crop these expedients however applied to only one part of the property of this unfortunate man but mr tyrrel did not stop here a sudden mortality took place among hawkinss live stock attended with very suspicious circumstances hawkinss vigilance was strongly excited by this event and he at length succeeded in tracing the matter so accurately that he conceived he could bring it home to mr tyrrel himself hawkins had hitherto carefully avoided notwithstanding the injuries he had suffered the attempting to right himself by legal process being of opinion that law was better adapted for a weapon of tyranny in the hands of the rich than for a shield to protect the humbler part of the community against their usurpations in this last instance however he conceived that the offence was so atrocious as to make it impossible that any rank could protect the culprit against the severity of justice in the sequel he saw reason to applaud himself for his former inactivity in this respect and to repent that any motive had been strong enough to persuade him into a contrary system this was the very point to which mr tyrrel wanted to bring him and he could scarcely credit his good fortune when he was told that hawkins had entered an action his congratulation upon this occasion was immoderate as he now conceived that the ruin of his late favourite was irretrievable he consulted his attorney and urged him by every motive he could devise to employ the whole series of his subterfuges in the present affair the direct repelling of the charge exhibited against him was the least part of his care the business was by affidavits motions pleas demurrers flaws and appeals to protract the question from term to term and from court to court it would as mr tyrrel argued be the disgrace of a civilized country if a gentleman when insolently attacked in law by the scum of the earth could not convert the cause into a question of the longest purse and stick in the skirts of his adversary till he had reduced him to beggary mr tyrrel however was by no means so far engrossed by his lawsuit as to neglect other methods of proceeding offensively against his tenant among the various expedients that suggested themselves there was one which though it tended rather to torment than irreparably injure the sufferer was not rejected this was derived from the particular situation of hawkinss house barns stacks and outhouses they were placed at the extremity of a slip of land connecting them with the rest of the farm and were surrounded on three sides by fields in the occupation of one of mr tyrrels tenants most devoted to the pleasures of his landlord the road to the markettown ran at the bottom of the largest of these fields and was directly in view of the front of the house no inconvenience had yet arisen from that circumstance as there had always been a broad path that intersected this field and led directly from hawkinss house to the road this path or private road was now by concert of mr tyrrel and his obliging tenant shut up so as to make hawkins a sort of prisoner in his own domains and oblige him to go near a mile about for the purposes of his traffic young hawkins the lad who had been the original subject of dispute between his father and the squire had much of his fathers spirit and felt an uncontrollable indignation against the successive acts of despotism of which he was a witness his resentment was the greater because the sufferings to which his parent was exposed all of them flowed from affection to him at the same time that he could not propose removing the ground of dispute as by so doing he would seem to fly in the face of his fathers paternal kindness upon the present occasion without asking any counsel but of his own impatient resentment he went in the middle of the night and removed all the obstructions that had been placed in the way of the old path broke the padlocks that had been fixed and threw open the gates in these operations he did not proceed unobserved and the next day a warrant was issued for apprehending him he was accordingly carried before a meeting of justices and by them committed to the county gaol to take his trial for the felony at the next assizes mr tyrrel was determined to prosecute the offence with the greatest severity and his attorney having made the proper enquiries for that purpose undertook to bring it under that clause of the act   geo i commonly called the black act which declares that any person armed with a sword or other offensive weapon and having his face blackened or being otherwise disguised appearing in any warren or place where hares or conies have been or shall be usually kept and being thereof duly convicted shall be adjudged guilty of felony and shall suffer death as in cases of felony without benefit of clergy young hawkins it seemed had buttoned the cape of his great coat over his face as soon as he perceived himself to be observed and he was furnished with a wrenchingiron for the purpose of breaking the padlocks the attorney further undertook to prove by sufficient witnesses that the field in question was a warren in which hares were regularly fed mr tyrrel seized upon these pretences with inexpressible satisfaction he prevailed upon the justices by the picture he drew of the obstinacy and insolence of the hawkinses fully to commit the lad upon this miserable charge and it was by no means so certain as paternal affection would have desired that the same overpowering influence would not cause in the sequel the penal clause to be executed in all its strictness this was the finishing stroke to hawkinss miseries as he was not deficient in courage he had stood up against his other persecutions without flinching he was not unaware of the advantages which our laws and customs give to the rich over the poor in contentions of this kind but being once involved there was a stubbornness in his nature that would not allow him to retract and he suffered himself to hope rather than expect a favourable issue but in this last event he was wounded in the point that was nearest his heart he had feared to have his son contaminated and debased by a servile station and he now saw him transferred to the seminary of a gaol he was even uncertain as to the issue of his imprisonment and trembled to think what the tyranny of wealth might effect to blast his hopes for ever from this moment his heart died within him he had trusted to persevering industry and skill to save the wreck of his little property from the vulgar spite of his landlord but he had now no longer any spirit to exert those efforts which his situation more than ever required mr tyrrel proceeded without remission in his machinations hawkinss affairs every day grew more desperate and the squire watching the occasion took the earliest opportunity of seizing upon his remaining property in the mode of a distress for rent it was precisely in this stage of the affair that mr falkland and mr tyrrel accidentally met in a private road near the habitation of the latter they were on horseback and mr falkland was going to the house of the unfortunate tenant who seemed upon the point of perishing under his landlords malice he had been just made acquainted with the tale of this persecution it had indeed been an additional aggravation of hawkinss calamity that mr falkland whose interference might otherwise have saved him had been absent from the neighbourhood for a considerable time he had been three months in london and from thence had gone to visit his estates in another part of the island the proud and selfconfident spirit of this poor fellow always disposed him to depend as long as possible upon his own exertions he had avoided applying to mr falkland or indeed indulging himself in any manner in communicating and bewailing his hard hap in the beginning of the contention and when the extremity grew more urgent and he would have been willing to recede in some degree from the stubbornness of his measures he found it no longer in his power after an absence of considerable duration mr falkland at length returned somewhat unexpectedly and having learned among the first articles of country intelligence the distresses of this unfortunate yeoman he resolved to ride over to his house the next morning and surprise him with all the relief it was in his power to bestow at sight of mr tyrrel in this unexpected rencounter his face reddened with indignation his first feeling as he afterwards said was to avoid him but finding that he must pass him he conceived that it would be want of spirit not to acquaint him with his feelings on the present occasion mr tyrrel said he somewhat abruptly i am sorry for a piece of news which i have just heard and pray sir what is your sorrow to me a great deal sir it is caused by the distresses of a poor tenant of yours hawkins if your steward have proceeded without your authority i think it right to inform you what he has done and if he have had your authority i would gladly persuade you to think better of it mr falkland it would be quite as well if you would mind your own business and leave me to mind mine i want no monitor and i will have none you mistake mr tyrrel i am minding my own business if i see you fall into a pit it is my business to draw you out and save your life if i see you pursuing a wrong mode of conduct it is my business to set you right and save your honour zounds sir do not think to put your conundrums upon me is not the man my tenant is not my estate my own what signifies calling it mine if i am not to have the direction of it sir i pay for what i have i owe no man a penny and i will not put my estate to nurse to you nor the best he that wears a head it is very true said mr falkland avoiding any direct notice of the last words of mr tyrrel that there is a distinction of ranks i believe that distinction is a good thing and necessary to the peace of mankind but however necessary it may be we must acknowledge that it puts some hardship upon the lower orders of society it makes ones heart ache to think that one man is born to the inheritance of every superfluity while the whole share of another without any demerit of his is drudgery and starving and that all this is indispensable we that are rich mr tyrrel must do every thing in our power to lighten the yoke of these unfortunate people we must not use the advantage that accident has given us with an unmerciful hand poor wretches they are pressed almost beyond bearing as it is and if we unfeelingly give another turn to the machine they will be crushed into atoms this picture was not without its effect even upon the obdurate mind of mr tyrrelâ€”well sir i am no tyrant i know very well that tyranny is a bad thing but you do not infer from thence that these people are to do as they please and never meet with their deserts mr tyrrel i see that you are shaken in your animosity suffer me to hail the newborn benevolence of your nature go with me to hawkins do not let us talk of his deserts poor fellow he has suffered almost all that human nature can endure let your forgiveness upon this occasion be the earnest of good neighbourhood and friendship between you and me no sir i will not go i own there is something in what you say i always knew you had the wit to make good your own story and tell a plausible tale but i will not be come over thus it has been my character when i had once conceived a scheme of vengeance never to forego it and i will not change that character i took up hawkins when every body forsook him and made a man of him and the ungrateful rascal has only insulted me for my pains curse me if i ever forgive him it would be a good jest indeed if i were to forgive the insolence of my own creature at the desire of a man like you that has been my perpetual plague for gods sake mr tyrrel have some reason in your resentment let us suppose that hawkins has behaved unjustifiably and insulted you is that an offence that never can be expiated must the father be ruined and the son hanged to glut your resentment damn me sir but you may talk your heart out you shall get nothing of me i shall never forgive myself for having listened to you for a moment i will suffer nobody to stop the stream of my resentment if i ever were to forgive him it should be at nobodys entreaty but my own but sir i never will if he and all his family were at my feet i would order them all to be hanged the next minute if my power were as good as my will and this is your decision is it mr tyrrel i am ashamed of you almighty god to hear you talk gives one a loathing for the institutions and regulations of society and would induce one to fly the very face of man but no society casts you out man abominates you no wealth no rank can buy out your stain you will live deserted in the midst of your species you will go into crowded societies and no one will deign so much as to salute you they will fly from your glance as they would from the gaze of a basilisk where do you expect to find the hearts of flint that shall sympathise with yours you have the stamp of misery incessant undivided unpitied misery thus saying mr falkland gave spurs to his horse rudely pushed beside mr tyrrel and was presently out of sight flaming indignation annihilated even his favourite sense of honour and he regarded his neighbour as a wretch with whom it was impossible even to enter into contention for the latter he remained for the present motionless and petrified the glowing enthusiasm of mr falkland was such as might well have unnerved the stoutest foe mr tyrrel in spite of himself was blasted with the compunctions of guilt and unable to string himself for the contest the picture mr falkland had drawn was prophetic it described what mr tyrrel chiefly feared and what in its commencements he thought he already felt it was responsive to the whispering of his own meditations it simply gave body and voice to the spectre that haunted him and to the terrors of which he was an hourly prey by and by however he recovered the more he had been temporarily confounded the fiercer was his resentment when he came to himself such hatred never existed in a human bosom without marking its progress with violence and death mr tyrrel however felt no inclination to have recourse to personal defiance he was the furthest in the world from a coward but his genius sunk before the genius of falkland he left his vengeance to the disposal of circumstances he was secure that his animosity would never be forgotten nor diminished by the interposition of any time or events vengeance was his nightly dream and the uppermost of his waking thoughts mr falkland had departed from this conference with a confirmed disapprobation of the conduct of his neighbour and an unalterable resolution to do every thing in his power to relieve the distresses of hawkins but he was too late when he arrived he found the house already evacuated by its master the family was removed nobody knew whither hawkins had absconded and what was still more extraordinary the boy hawkins had escaped on the very same day from the county gaol the enquiries mr falkland set on foot after them were fruitless no traces could be found of the catastrophe of these unhappy people that catastrophe i shall shortly have occasion to relate and it will be found pregnant with horror beyond what the blackest misanthropy could readily have suggested i go on with my tale i go on to relate those incidents in which my own fate was so mysteriously involved i lift the curtain and bring forward the last act of the tragedy  chapter x it may easily be supposed that the ill temper cherished by mr tyrrel in his contention with hawkins and the increasing animosity between him and mr falkland added to the impatience with which he thought of the escape of emily mr tyrrel heard with astonishment of the miscarriage of an expedient of the success of which he had not previously entertained the slightest suspicion he became frantic with vexation grimes had not dared to signify the event of his expedition in person and the footman whom he desired to announce to his master that miss melville was lost the moment after fled from his presence with the most dreadful apprehensions presently he bellowed for grimes and the young man at last appeared before him more dead than alive grimes he compelled to repeat the particulars of the tale which he had no sooner done than he once again slunk away shocked at the execrations with which mr tyrrel overwhelmed him grimes was no coward but he reverenced the inborn divinity that attends upon rank as indians worship the devil nor was this all the rage of mr tyrrel was so ungovernable and fierce that few hearts could have been found so stout as not to have trembled before it with a sort of unconquerable inferiority he no sooner obtained a moments pause than he began to recall to his tempestuous mind the various circumstances of the case his complaints were bitter and in a tranquil observer might have produced the united feeling of pity for his sufferings and horror at his depravity he recollected all the precautions he had used he could scarcely find a flaw in the process and he cursed that blind and malicious power which delighted to cross his most deeplaid schemes of this malice he was beyond all other human beings the object he was mocked with the shadow of power and when he lifted his hand to smite it was struck with sudden palsy in the bitterness of his anguish he forgot his recent triumph over hawkins or perhaps he regarded it less as a triumph than an overthrow because it had failed of coming up to the extent of his malice to what purpose had heaven given him a feeling of injury and an instinct to resent while he could in no case make his resentment felt it was only necessary for him to be the enemy of any person to insure that persons being safe against the reach of misfortune what insults the most shocking and repeated had he received from this paltry girl and by whom was she now torn from his indignation by that devil that haunted him at every moment that crossed him at every step that fixed at pleasure his arrows in his heart and made mows and mockery at his insufferable tortures there was one other reflection that increased his anguish and made him careless and desperate as to his future conduct it was in vain to conceal from himself that his reputation would be cruelly wounded by this event he had imagined that while emily was forced into this odious marriage she would be obliged by decorum as soon as the event was decided to draw a veil over the compulsion she had suffered but this security was now lost and mr falkland would take a pride in publishing his dishonour though the provocations he had received from miss melville would in his own opinion have justified him in any treatment he should have thought proper to inflict he was sensible the world would see the matter in a different light this reflection augmented the violence of his resolutions and determined him to refuse no means by which he could transfer the anguish that now preyed upon his own mind to that of another meanwhile the composure and magnanimity of emily had considerably subsided the moment she believed herself in a place of safety while danger and injustice assailed her with their menaces she found in herself a courage that disdained to yield the succeeding appearance of calm was more fatal to her there was nothing now powerfully to foster her courage or excite her energy she looked back at the trials she had passed and her soul sickened at the recollection of that which while it was in act she had had the fortitude to endure till the period at which mr tyrrel had been inspired with this cruel antipathy she had been in all instances a stranger to anxiety and fear uninured to misfortune she had suddenly and without preparation been made the subject of the most infernal malignity when a man of robust and vigorous constitution has a fit of sickness it produces a more powerful effect than the same indisposition upon a delicate valetudinarian such was the case with miss melville she passed the succeeding night sleepless and uneasy and was found in the morning with a high fever her distemper resisted for the present all attempts to assuage it though there was reason to hope that the goodness of her constitution assisted by tranquillity and the kindness of those about her would ultimately surmount it on the second day she was delirious on the night of that day she was arrested at the suit of mr tyrrel for a debt contracted for board and necessaries for the last fourteen years the idea of this arrest as the reader will perhaps recollect first occurred in the conversation between mr tyrrel and miss melville soon after he had thought proper to confine her to her chamber but at that time he had probably no serious conception of ever being induced to carry it into execution it had merely been mentioned by way of threat and as the suggestion of a mind whose habits had long been accustomed to contemplate every possible instrument of tyranny and revenge but now that the unlookedfor rescue and escape of his poor kinswoman had wrought up his thoughts to a degree of insanity and that he revolved in the gloomy recesses of his mind how he might best shake off the load of disappointment which oppressed him the idea recurred with double force he was not long in forming his resolution and calling for barnes his steward immediately gave him directions in what manner to proceed barnes had been for several years the instrument of mr tyrrels injustice his mind was hardened by use and he could without remorse officiate as the spectator or even as the author and director of a scene of vulgar distress but even he was somewhat startled upon the present occasion the character and conduct of emily in mr tyrrels family had been without a blot she had not a single enemy and it was impossible to contemplate her youth her vivacity and her guileless innocence without emotions of sympathy and compassion your worshipâ€”i do not understand youarrest missâ€”miss emily yesâ€”i tell youwhat is the matter with youâ€”go instantly to swineard the lawyer and bid him finish the business out of hand lord love your honour arrest her why she does not owe you a brass farthing she always lived upon your charity ass scoundrel i tell you she does owe meâ€”owes me eleven hundred poundsâ€”the law justifies itâ€”what do you think laws were made for i do nothing but right and right i will have your honour i never questioned your orders in my life but i must now i cannot see you ruin miss emily poor girl nay and yourself too for the matter of that and not say which way you are going i hope you will bear with me why if she owed you ever so much she cannot be arrested she is not of age will you have doneâ€”do not tell me ofâ€”it cannot and it can it has been done beforeâ€”and it shall be done again let him dispute it that dares i will do it now and stand to it afterwards tell swineardâ€”if he make the least boggling it is as much as his life is worthâ€”he shall starve by inches pray your honour think better of it upon my life the whole country will cry shame of it barneswhat do you mean i am not used to be talked to and i cannot hear it you have been a good fellow to me upon many occasionsâ€”but if i find you out for making one with them that dispute my authority damn my soul if i do not make you sick of your life i have done your honour i will not say another word except thisâ€”i have heard as how that miss emily is sick abed you are determined you say to put her in jail you do not mean to kill her i take it let her die i will not spare her for an hourâ€”i will not always be insulted she had no consideration for me and i have no mercy for herâ€”i am in for it they have provoked me past bearingâ€”and they shall feel me tell swineard in bed or up day or night i will not hear of an instants delay such were the directions of mr tyrrel and in strict conformity to his directions were the proceedings of that respectable limb of the law he employed upon the present occasion miss melville had been delirious through a considerable part of the day on the evening of which the bailiff and his follower arrived by the direction of the physician whom mr falkland had ordered to attend her a composing draught was administered and exhausted as she was by the wild and distracted images that for several hours had haunted her fancy she was now sunk into a refreshing slumber mrs hammond the sister of mrs jakeman was sitting by her bedside full of compassion for the lovely sufferer and rejoicing in the calm tranquillity that had just taken possession of her when a little girl the only child of mrs hammond opened the streetdoor to the rap of the bailiff he said he wanted to speak with miss melville and the child answered that she would go tell her mother so saying she advanced to the door of the backroom upon the groundfloor in which emily lay but the moment it was opened instead of waiting for the appearance of the mother the bailiff entered along with the girl mrs hammond looked up who are you said she why do you come in here hush be quiet i must speak with miss melville indeed but you must not tell me your business the poor child has been lightheaded all day she has just fallen asleep and must not be disturbed that is no business of mine i must obey orders orders whose orders what is it you mean at this moment emily opened her eyes what noise is that pray let me be quiet miss i want to speak with you i have got a writ against you for eleven hundred pounds at the suit of squire tyrrel at these words both mrs hammond and emily were dumb the latter was scarcely able to annex any meaning to the intelligence and though mrs hammond was somewhat better acquainted with the sort of language that was employed yet in this strange and unexpected connection it was almost as mysterious to her as to poor emily herself a writ how can she be in mr tyrrels debt a writ against a child it is no signification putting your questions to us we only do as we are directed there is our authority look at it lord almighty exclaimed mrs hammond what does this mean it is impossible mr tyrrel should have sent you good woman none of your jabber to us cannot you read this is all a trick the paper is forged it is a vile contrivance to get the poor orphan out of the hands of those with whom only she can be safe proceed upon it at your peril rest you content that is exactly what we mean to do take my word we know very well what we are about why you would not tear her from her bed i tell you she is in a high fever she is lightheaded it would be death to remove her you are bailiffs are not you you are not murderers the law says nothing about that we have orders to take her sick or well we will do her no harm except so far as we must perform our office be it how it will where would you take her what is it you mean to do to the county jail bullock go order a postchaise from the griffin stay i say give no such orders wait only three hours i will send off a messenger express to squire falkland and i am sure he will satisfy you as to any harm that can come to you without its being necessary to take the poor child to jail we have particular directions against that we are not at liberty to lose a minute why are not you gone order the horses to be put to immediately emily had listened to the course of this conversation which had sufficiently explained to her whatever was enigmatical in the first appearance of the bailiffs the painful and incredible reality that was thus presented effectually dissipated the illusions of frenzy to which she had just been a prey my dear madam said she to mrs hammond do not harass yourself with useless efforts i am very sorry for all the trouble i have given you but my misfortune is inevitable sir if you will step into the next room i will dress myself and attend you immediately mrs hammond began to be equally aware that her struggles were to no purpose but she could not be equally patient at one moment she raved upon the brutality of mr tyrrel whom she affirmed to be a devil incarnate and not a man at another she expostulated with bitter invective against the hardheartedness of the bailiff and exhorted him to mix some humanity and moderation with the discharge of his function but he was impenetrable to all she could urge in the mean while emily yielded with the sweetest resignation to an inevitable evil mrs hammond insisted that at least they should permit her to attend her young lady in the chaise and the bailiff though the orders he had received were so peremptory that he dared not exercise his discretion as to the execution of the writ began to have some apprehensions of danger and was willing to admit of any precaution that was not in direct hostility to his functions for the rest he understood that it was in all cases dangerous to allow sickness or apparent unfitness for removal as a sufficient cause to interrupt a direct process and that accordingly in all doubtful questions and presumptive murders the practice of the law inclined with a laudable partiality to the vindication of its own officers in addition to these general rules he was influenced by the positive injunctions and assurances of swineard and the terror which through a circle of many miles was annexed to the name of tyrrel before they departed mrs hammond despatched a messenger with a letter of three lines to mr falkland informing him of this extraordinary event mr falkland was from home when the messenger arrived and not expected to return till the second day accident seemed in this instance to favour the vengeance of mr tyrrel for he had himself been too much under the dominion of an uncontrollable fury to take a circumstance of this sort into his estimate the forlorn state of these poor women who were conducted the one by compulsion the other a volunteer to a scene so little adapted to their accommodation as that of a common jail may easily be imagined mrs hammond however was endowed with a masculine courage and impetuosity of spirit eminently necessary in the difficulties they had to encounter she was in some degree fitted by a sanguine temper and an impassioned sense of injustice for the discharge of those very offices which sobriety and calm reflection might have prescribed the health of miss melville was materially affected by the surprise and removal she had undergone at the very time that repose was most necessary for her preservation her fever became more violent her delirium was stronger and the tortures of her imagination were proportioned to the unfavourableness of the state in which the removal had been effected it was highly improbable that she could recover in the moments of suspended reason she was perpetually calling on the name of falkland mr falkland she said was her first and only love and he should be her husband a moment after she exclaimed upon him in a disconsolate yet reproachful tone for his unworthy deference to the prejudices of the world it was very cruel of him to show himself so proud and tell her that he would never consent to marry a beggar but if he were proud she was determined to be proud too he should see that she would not conduct herself like a slighted maiden and that though he could reject her it was not in his power to break her heart at another time she imagined she saw mr tyrrel and his engine grimes their hands and garments dropping with blood and the pathetic reproaches she vented against them might have affected a heart of stone then the figure of falkland presented itself to her distracted fancy deformed with wounds and of a deadly paleness and she shrieked with agony while she exclaimed that such was the general hardheartedness that no one would make the smallest exertion for his rescue in such vicissitudes of pain perpetually imagining to her self unkindness insult conspiracy and murder she passed a considerable part of two days on the evening of the second mr falkland arrived accompanied by doctor wilson the physician by whom she had previously been attended the scene he was called upon to witness was such as to be most exquisitely agonising to a man of his acute sensibility the news of the arrest had given him an inexpressible shock he was transported out of himself at the unexampled malignity of its author but when he saw the figure of miss melville haggard and a warrant of death written in her countenance a victim to the diabolical passions of her kinsman it seemed too much to be endured when he entered she was in the midst of one of her fits of delirium and immediately mistook her visitors for two assassins she asked where they had hid her falkland her lord her life her husband and demanded that they should restore to her his mangled corpse that she might embrace him with her dying arms breathe her last upon his lips and be buried in the same grave she reproached them with the sordidness of their conduct in becoming the tools of her vile cousin who had deprived her of her reason and would never be contented till he had murdered her mr falkland tore himself away from this painful scene and leaving doctor wilson with his patient desired him when he had given the necessary directions to follow him to his inn the perpetual hurry of spirits in which miss melville had been kept for several days by the nature of her indisposition was extremely exhausting to her and in about an hour from the visit of mr falkland her delirium subsided and left her in so low a state as to render it difficult to perceive any signs of life doctor wilson who had withdrawn to soothe if possible the disturbed and impatient thoughts of mr falkland was summoned afresh upon this change of symptoms and sat by the bedside during the remainder of the night the situation of his patient was such as to keep him in momentary apprehension of her decease while miss melville lay in this feeble and exhausted condition mrs hammond betrayed every token of the tenderest anxiety her sensibility was habitually of the acutest sort and the qualities of emily were such as powerfully to fix her affection she loved her like a mother upon the present occasion every sound every motion made her tremble doctor wilson had introduced another nurse in consideration of the incessant fatigue mrs hammond had undergone and he endeavoured by representations and even by authority to compel her to quit the apartment of the patient but she was uncontrollable and he at length found that he should probably do her more injury by the violence that would be necessary to separate her from the suffering innocent than by allowing her to follow her inclination her eye was a thousand times turned with the most eager curiosity upon the countenance of doctor wilson without her daring to breathe a question respecting his opinion lest he should answer her by a communication of the most fatal tidings in the mean time she listened with the deepest attention to every thing that dropped either from the physician or the nurse hoping to collect as it were from some oblique hint the intelligence which she had not courage expressly to require towards morning the state of the patient seemed to take a favourable turn she dozed for near two hours and when she awoke appeared perfectly calm and sensible understanding that mr falkland had brought the physician to attend her and was himself in her neighbourhood she requested to see him mr falkland had gone in the mean time with one of his tenants to bail the debt and now entered the prison to enquire whether the young lady might be safely removed from her present miserable residence to a more airy and commodious apartment when he appeared the sight of him revived in the mind of miss melville an imperfect recollection of the wanderings of her delirium she covered her face with her fingers and betrayed the most expressive confusion while she thanked him with her usual unaffected simplicity for the trouble he had taken she hoped she should not give him much more she thought she should get better it was a shame she said if a young and lively girl as she was could not contrive to outlive the trifling misfortunes to which she had been subjected but while she said this she was still extremely weak she tried to assume a cheerful countenance but it was a faint effort which the feeble state of her frame did not seem sufficient to support mr falkland and the doctor joined to request her to keep herself quiet and avoid for the present all occasions of exertion encouraged by these appearances mrs hammond ventured to follow the two gentlemen out of the room in order to learn from the physician what hopes he entertained doctor wilson acknowledged that he found his patient at first in a very unfavourable situation that the symptoms were changed for the better and that he was not without some expectation of her recovery he added however that he could answer for nothing that the next twelve hours would be exceedingly critical but that if she did not grow worse before morning he would then undertake for her life mrs hammond who had hitherto seen nothing but despair now became frantic with joy she burst into tears of transport blessed the physician in the most emphatic and impassioned terms and uttered a thousand extravagancies doctor wilson seized this opportunity to press her to give herself a little repose to which she consented a bed being first procured for her in the room next to miss melvilles she having charged the nurse to give her notice of any alteration in the state of the patient mrs hammond enjoyed an uninterrupted sleep of several hours it was already night when she was awaked by an unusual bustle in the next room she listened for a few moments and then determined to go and discover the occasion of it as she opened her door for that purpose she met the nurse coming to her the countenance of the messenger told her what it was she had to communicate without the use of words she hurried to the bedside and found miss melville expiring the appearances that had at first been so encouraging were of short duration the calm of the morning proved to be only a sort of lightening before death in a few hours the patient grew worse the bloom of her countenance faded she drew her breath with difficulty and her eyes became fixed doctor wilson came in at this period and immediately perceived that all was over she was for some time in convulsions but these subsiding she addressed the physician with a composed though feeble voice she thanked him for his attention and expressed the most lively sense of her obligations to mr falkland she sincerely forgave her cousin and hoped he might never be visited by too acute a recollection of his barbarity to her she would have been contented to live few persons had a sincerer relish of the pleasures of life but she was well pleased to die rather than have become the wife of grimes as mrs hammond entered she turned her countenance towards her and with an affectionate expression repeated her name this was her last word in less than two hours from that time she breathed her last in the arms of this faithful friend  chapter xi such was the fate of miss emily melville perhaps tyranny never exhibited a more painful memorial of the detestation in which it deserves to be held the idea irresistibly excited in every spectator of the scene was that of regarding mr tyrrel as the most diabolical wretch that had ever dishonoured the human form the very attendants upon this house of oppression for the scene was acted upon too public a stage not to be generally understood expressed their astonishment and disgust at his unparalleled cruelty if such were the feelings of men bred to the commission of injustice it is difficult to say what must have been those of mr falkland he raved he swore he beat his head he rent up his hair he was unable to continue in one posture and to remain in one place he burst away from the spot with vehemence as if he sought to leave behind him his recollection and his existence he seemed to tear up the ground with fierceness and rage he returned soon again he approached the sad remains of what had been emily and gazed on them with such intentness that his eyes appeared ready to burst from their sockets acute and exquisite as were his notions of virtue and honour he could not prevent himself from reproaching the system of nature for having given birth to such a monster as tyrrel he was ashamed of himself for wearing the same form he could not think of the human species with patience he foamed with indignation against the laws of the universe that did not permit him to crush such reptiles at a blow as we would crush so many noxious insects it was necessary to guard him like a madman the whole office of judging what was proper to be done under the present circumstances devolved upon doctor wilson the doctor was a man of cool and methodical habits of acting one of the first ideas that suggested itself to him was that miss melvile was a branch of the family of tyrrel he did not doubt of the willingness of mr falkland to discharge every expense that might be further incident to the melancholy remains of this unfortunate victim but he conceived that the laws of fashion and decorum required some notification of the event to be made to the head of the family perhaps too he had an eye to his interest in his profession and was reluctant to expose himself to the resentment of a person of mr tyrrels consideration in the neighbourhood but with this weakness he had nevertheless some feelings in common with the rest of the world and must have suffered considerable violence before he could have persuaded himself to be the messenger beside which he did not think it right in the present situation to leave mr falkland doctor wilson no sooner mentioned these ideas than they seemed to make a sudden impression on mrs hammond and she earnestly requested that she might be permitted to carry the intelligence the proposal was unexpected but the doctor did not very obstinately refuse his assent she was determined she said to see what sort of impression the catastrophe would make upon the author of it and she promised to comport herself with moderation and civility the journey was soon performed i am come sir said she to mr tyrrel to inform you that your cousin miss melville died this afternoon died yes sir i saw her die she died in these arms died who killed her what do you mean who is it for you to ask that question your cruelty and malice killed her meâ€”myâ€”poh she is not deadâ€”it cannot beâ€”it is not a week since she left this house do not you believe me i say she is dead have a care woman this is no matter for jesting no though she used me ill i would not believe her dead for all the world mrs hammond shook her head in a manner expressive at once of grief and indignation no no no no i will never believe thatno never will you come with me and convince your eyes it is a sight worthy of you and will be a feast to such a heart as yoursâ€”saying this mrs hammond offered her hand as if to conduct him to the spot mr tyrrel shrunk back if she be dead what is that to me am i to answer for every thing that goes wrong in the worldâ€”what do you come here for why bring your messages to me to whom should i bring them but to her kinsmanâ€”and her murderer murdererâ€”did i employ knives or pistols did i give her poison i did nothing but what the law allows if she be dead nobody can say that i am to blame to blameâ€”all the world will abhor and curse you were you such a fool as to think because men pay respect to wealth and rank this would extend to such a deed they will laugh at so barefaced a cheat the meanest beggar will spurn and spit at you ay you may well stand confounded at what you have done i will proclaim you to the whole world and you will be obliged to fly the very face of a human creature good woman said mr tyrrel extremely humbled talk no more in this strainemmy is not dead i am sureâ€”i hopeâ€”she is not deadtell me that you have only been deceiving me and i will forgive you every thingâ€”i will forgive herâ€”i will take her into favourâ€”i will do any thing you pleasei never meant her any harm i tell you she is dead you have murdered the sweetest innocent that lived can you bring her back to life as you have driven her out of it if you could i would kneel to you twenty times a day what is it you have doneâ€”miserable wretch did you think you could do and undo and change things this way and that as you pleased the reproaches of mrs hammond were the first instance in which mr tyrrel was made to drink the full cup of retribution this was however only a specimen of a long series of contempt abhorrence and insult that was reserved for him the words of mrs hammond were prophetic it evidently appeared that though wealth and hereditary elevation operate as an apology for many delinquencies there are some which so irresistibly address themselves to the indignation of mankind that like death they level all distinctions and reduce their perpetrator to an equality with the most indigent and squalid of his species against mr tyrrel as the tyrannical and unmanly murderer of emily those who dared not venture the unreserved avowal of their sentiments muttered curses deep not loud while the rest joined in an universal cry of abhorrence and execration he stood astonished at the novelty of his situation accustomed as he had been to the obedience and trembling homage of mankind he had imagined they would be perpetual and that no excess on his part would ever be potent enough to break the enchantment now he looked round and saw sullen detestation in every face which with difficulty restrained itself and upon the slightest provocation broke forth with an impetuous tide and swept away the mounds of subordination and fear his large estate could not purchase civility from the gentry the peasantry scarcely from his own servants in the indignation of all around him he found a ghost that haunted him with every change of place and a remorse that stung his conscience and exterminated his peace the neighbourhood appeared more and more every day to be growing too hot for him to endure and it became evident that he would ultimately be obliged to quit the country urged by the flagitiousness of this last example people learned to recollect every other instance of his excesses and it was no doubt a fearful catalogue that rose up in judgment against him it seemed as if the sense of public resentment had long been gathering strength unperceived and now burst forth into insuppressible violence there was scarcely a human being upon whom this sort of retribution could have sat more painfully than upon mr tyrrel though he had not a consciousness of innocence prompting him continually to recoil from the detestation of mankind as a thing totally unallied to his character yet the imperiousness of his temper and the constant experience he had had of the pliability of other men prepared him to feel the general and undisguised condemnation into which he was sunk with uncommon emotions of anger and impatience that he at the beam of whose eye every countenance fell and to whom in the fierceness of his wrath no one was daring enough to reply should now be regarded with avowed dislike and treated with unceremonious censure was a thing he could not endure to recollect or believe symptoms of the universal disgust smote him at every instant and at every blow he writhed with intolerable anguish his rage was unbounded and raving he repelled every attack with the fiercest indignation while the more he struggled the more desperate his situation appeared to become at length he determined to collect his strength for a decisive effort and to meet the whole tide of public opinion in a single scene in pursuance of these thoughts he resolved to repair without delay to the rural assembly which i have already mentioned in the course of my story miss melville had now been dead one month mr falkland had been absent the last week in a distant part of the country and was not expected to return for a week longer mr tyrrel willingly embraced the opportunity trusting if he could now effect his reestablishment that he should easily preserve the ground he had gained even in the face of his formidable rival mr tyrrel was not deficient in courage but he conceived the present to be too important an epoch in his life to allow him to make any unnecessary risk in his chance for future ease and importance there was a sort of bustle that took place at his entrance into the assembly it having been agreed by the gentlemen of the assembly that mr tyrrel was to be refused admittance as a person with whom they did not choose to associate this vote had already been notified to him by letter by the master of the ceremonies but the intelligence was rather calculated with a man of mr tyrrels disposition to excite defiance than to overawe at the door of the assembly he was personally met by the master of the ceremonies who had perceived the arrival of an equipage and who now endeavoured to repeat his prohibition but he was thrust aside by mr tyrrel with an air of native authority and ineffable contempt as he entered every eye was turned upon him presently all the gentlemen in the room assembled round him some endeavoured to hustle him and others began to expostulate but he found the secret effectually to silence the one set and to shake off the other his muscular form the wellknown eminence of his intellectual powers the long habits to which every man was formed of acknowledging his ascendancy were all in his favour he considered himself as playing a desperate stake and had roused all the energies he possessed to enable him to do justice to so interesting a transaction disengaged from the insects that at first pestered him he paced up and down the room with a magisterial stride and flashed an angry glance on every side he then broke silence if any one had any thing to say to him he should know where and how to answer him he would advise any such person however to consider well what he was about if any man imagined he had any thing personally to complain of it was very well but he did expect that nobody there would be ignorant and raw enough to meddle with what was no business of theirs and intrude into the concerns of any mans private family this being a sort of defiance one and another gentleman advanced to answer it he that was first began to speak but mr tyrrel by the expression of his countenance and a peremptory tone by welltimed interruptions and pertinent insinuations caused him first to hesitate and then to be silent he seemed to be fast advancing to the triumph he had promised himself the whole company were astonished they felt the same abhorrence and condemnation of his character but they could not help admiring the courage and resources he displayed upon the present occasion they could without difficulty have concentred afresh their indignant feelings but they seemed to want a leader at this critical moment mr falkland entered the room mere accident had enabled him to return sooner than he expected both he and mr tyrrel reddened at sight of each other he advanced towards mr tyrrel without a moments pause and in a peremptory voice asked him what he did there here what do you mean by that this place is as free to me as you and you are the last person to whom i shall deign to give an account of myself sir the place is not free to you do not you know you have been voted out whatever were your rights your infamous conduct has forfeited them mr what do you call yourself if you have anything to say to me choose a proper time and place do not think to put on your bullying airs under shelter of this company i will not endure it you are mistaken sir this public scene is the only place where i can have any thing to say to you if you would not hear the universal indignation of mankind you must not come into the society of menâ€”miss melvilleshame upon you inhuman unrelenting tyrant can you hear her name and not sink into the earth can you retire into solitude and not see her pale and patient ghost rising to reproach you can you recollect her virtues her innocence her spotless manners her unresentful temper and not run distracted with remorse have you not killed her in the first bloom of her youth can you bear to think that she now lies mouldering in the grave through your cursed contrivance that deserved a crown ten thousand times more than you deserve to live and do you expect that mankind will ever forget or forgive such a deed go miserable wretch think yourself too happy that you are permitted to fly the face of man why what a pitiful figure do you make at this moment do you think that any thing could bring so hardened a wretch as you are to shrink from reproach if your conscience were not in confederacy with them that reproached you and were you fool enough to believe that any obstinacy however determined could enable you to despise the keen rebuke of justice go shrink into your miserable self begone and let me never be blasted with your sight again and here incredible as it may appear mr tyrrel began to obey his imperious censurer his looks were full of wildness and horror his limbs trembled and his tongue refused its office he felt no power of resisting the impetuous torrent of reproach that was poured upon him he hesitated he was ashamed of his own defeat he seemed to wish to deny it but his struggles were ineffectual every attempt perished in the moment it was made the general voice was eager to abash him as his confusion became more visible the outcry increased it swelled gradually to hootings tumult and a deafening noise of indignation at length he willingly retired from the public scene unable any longer to endure the sensations it inflicted in about an hour and a half he returned no precaution had been taken against this incident for nothing could be more unexpected in the interval he had intoxicated himself with large draughts of brandy in a moment he was in a part of the room where mr falkland was standing and with one blow of his muscular arm levelled him with the earth the blow however was not stunning and mr falkland rose again immediately it is obvious to perceive how unequal he must have been in this species of contest he was scarcely risen before mr tyrrel repeated his blow mr falkland was now upon his guard and did not fall but the blows of his adversary were redoubled with a rapidity difficult to conceive and mr falkland was once again brought to the earth in this situation mr tyrrel kicked his prostrate enemy and stooped apparently with the intention of dragging him along the floor all this passed in a moment and the gentlemen present had not time to recover their surprise they now interfered and mr tyrrel once more quitted the apartment it is difficult to conceive any event more terrible to the individual upon whom it fell than the treatment which mr falkland in this instance experienced every passion of his life was calculated to make him feel it more acutely he had repeatedly exerted an uncommon energy and prudence to prevent the misunderstanding between mr tyrrel and himself from proceeding to extremities but in vain it was closed with a catastrophe exceeding all that he had feared or that the most penetrating foresight could have suggested to mr falkland disgrace was worse than death the slightest breath of dishonour would have stung him to the very soul what must it have been with this complication of ignominy base humiliating and public could mr tyrrel have understood the evil he inflicted even he under all his circumstances of provocation could scarcely have perpetrated it mr falklands mind was full of uproar like the war of contending elements and of such suffering as casts contempt on the refinements of inventive cruelty he wished for annihilation to lie down in eternal oblivion in an insensibility which compared with what he experienced was scarcely less enviable than beatitude itself horror detestation revenge inexpressible longings to shake off the evil and a persuasion that in this case all effort was powerless filled his soul even to bursting one other event closed the transactions of this memorable evening mr falkland was baffled of the vengeance that yet remained to him mr tyrrel was found by some of the company dead in the street having been murdered at the distance of a few yards from the assembly house  chapter xii i shall endeavour to state the remainder of this narrative in the words of mr collins the reader has already had occasion to perceive that mr collins was a man of no vulgar order and his reflections on the subject were uncommonly judicious this day was the crisis of mr falklands history from hence took its beginning that gloomy and unsociable melancholy of which he has since been the victim no two characters can be in certain respects more strongly contrasted than the mr falkland of a date prior and subsequent to these events hitherto he had been attended by a fortune perpetually prosperous his mind was sanguine full of that undoubting confidence in its own powers which prosperity is qualified to produce though the habits of his life were those of a serious and sublime visionary they were nevertheless full of cheerfulness and tranquillity but from this moment his pride and the lofty adventurousness of his spirit were effectually subdued from an object of envy he was changed into an object of compassion life which hitherto no one had more exquisitely enjoyed became a burden to him no more selfcomplacency no more rapture no more selfapproving and hearttransporting benevolence he who had lived beyond any man upon the grand and animating reveries of the imagination seemed now to have no visions but of anguish and despair his case was peculiarly worthy of sympathy since no doubt if rectitude and purity of disposition could give a title to happiness few men could exhibit a more consistent and powerful claim than mr falkland he was too deeply pervaded with the idle and groundless romances of chivalry ever to forget the situation humiliating and dishonourable according to his ideas in which he had been placed upon this occasion there is a mysterious sort of divinity annexed to the person of a true knight that makes any species of brute violence committed upon it indelible and immortal to be knocked down cuffed kicked dragged along the floor sacred heaven the memory of such a treatment was not to be endured no future lustration could ever remove the stain and what was perhaps still worse in the present case the offender having ceased to exist the lustration which the laws of knighterrantry prescribe was rendered impossible in some future period of human improvement it is probable that that calamity will be in a manner unintelligible which in the present instance contributed to tarnish and wither the excellence of one of the most elevated and amiable of human minds if mr falkland had reflected with perfect accuracy upon the case he would probably have been able to look down with indifference upon a wound which as it was pierced to his very vitals how much more dignity than in the modern duellist do we find in themistocles the most gallant of the greeks who when eurybiades his commander in chief in answer to some of his remonstrances lifted his cane over him with a menacing air accosted him in that noble apostrophe strike but hear how would a man of true discernment in such a case reply to his brutal assailant i make it my boast that i can endure calamity and pain shall i not be able to endure the trifling inconvenience that your folly can inflict upon me perhaps a human being would be more accomplished if he understood the science of personal defence but how few would be the occasions upon which he would be called to exert it how few persons would he encounter so unjust and injurious as you if his own conduct were directed by the principles of reason and benevolence beside how narrow would be the use of this science when acquired it will scarcely put the man of delicate make and petty stature upon a level with the athletic pugilist and if it did in some measure secure me against the malice of a single adversary still my person and my life so far as mere force is concerned would always be at the mercy of two further than immediate defence against actual violence it could never be of use to me the man who can deliberately meet his adversary for the purpose of exposing the person of one or both of them to injury tramples upon every principle of reason and equity duelling is the vilest of all egotism treating the public who has a claim to all my powers and exertions as if it were nothing and myself or rather an unintelligible chimera i annex to myself as if it were entitled to my exclusive attention i am unable to cope with you what then can that circumstance dishonour me no i can only be dishonoured by perpetrating an unjust action my honour is in my own keeping beyond the reach of all mankind strike i am passive no injury that you can inflict shall provoke me to expose you or myself to unnecessary evil i refuse that but i am not therefore pusillanimous when i refuse any danger or suffering by which the general good may be promoted then brand me for a coward these reasonings however simple and irresistible they must be found by a dispassionate enquirer are little reflected on by the world at large and were most of all uncongenial to the prejudices of mr falkland but the public disgrace and chastisement that had been imposed upon him intolerable as they were to be recollected were not the whole of the mischief that redounded to our unfortunate patron from the transactions of that day it was presently whispered that he was no other than the murderer of his antagonist this rumour was of too much importance to the very continuance of his life to justify its being concealed from him he heard it with inexpressible astonishment and horror it formed a dreadful addition to the load of intellectual anguish that already oppressed him no man had ever held his reputation more dear than mr falkland and now in one day he was fallen under the most exquisite calamities a complicated personal insult and the imputation of the foulest of crimes he might have fled for no one was forward to proceed against a man so adored as mr falkland or in revenge of one so universally execrated as mr tyrrel but flight he disdained in the mean time the affair was of the most serious magnitude and the rumour unchecked seemed daily to increase in strength mr falkland appeared sometimes inclined to adopt such steps as might have been best calculated to bring the imputation to a speedy trial but he probably feared by too direct an appeal to judicature to render more precise an imputation the memory of which he deprecated at the same time that he was sufficiently willing to meet the severest scrutiny and if he could not hope to have it forgotten that he had ever been accused to prove in the most satisfactory manner that the accusation was unjust the neighbouring magistrates at length conceived it necessary to take some steps upon the subject without causing mr falkland to be apprehended they sent to desire he would appear before them at one of their meetings the proceeding being thus opened mr falkland expressed his hope that if the business were likely to stop there their investigation might at least be rendered as solemn as possible the meeting was numerous every person of a respectable class in society was admitted to be an auditor the whole town one of the most considerable in the county was apprised of the nature of the business few trials invested with all the forms of judgment have excited so general an interest a trial under the present circumstances was scarcely attainable and it seemed to be the wish both of principal and umpires to give to this transaction all the momentary notoriety and decisiveness of a trial the magistrates investigated the particulars of the story mr falkland it appeared had left the rooms immediately after his assailant and though he had been attended by one or two of the gentlemen to his inn it was proved that he had left them upon some slight occasion as soon as he arrived at it and that when they enquired for him of the waiters he had already mounted his horse and ridden home by the nature of the case no particular facts could be stated in balance against these as soon as they had been sufficiently detailed mr falkland therefore proceeded to his defence several copies of his defence weremade and mr falkland seemed for a short time to have had the idea of sending it to the press though for some reason or other he afterwards suppressed it i have one of the copies in my possession and i will read it to you saying this mr collins rose and took it from a private drawer in his escritoire during this action he appeared to recollect himself he did not in the strict sense of the word hesitate but he was prompted to make some apology for what he was doing you seem never to have heard of this memorable transaction and indeed that is little to be wondered at since the good nature of the world is interested in suppressing it and it is deemed a disgrace to a man to have defended himself from a criminal imputation though with circumstances the most satisfactory and honourable it may be supposed that this suppression is particularly acceptable to mr falkland and i should not have acted in contradiction to his modes of thinking in communicating the story to you had there not been circumstances of peculiar urgency that seemed to render the communication desirable saying this he proceeded to read from the paper in his hand gentlemen i stand here accused of a crime the most black that any human creature is capable of perpetrating i am innocent i have no fear that i shall fail to make every person in this company acknowledge my innocence in the mean time what must be my feelings conscious as i am of deserving approbation and not censure of having passed my life in acts of justice and philanthropy can any thing be more deplorable than for me to answer to a charge of murder so wretched is my situation that i cannot accept your gratuitous acquittal if you should be disposed to bestow it i must answer to an imputation the very thought of which is ten thousand times worse to me than death i must exert the whole energy of my mind to prevent my being ranked with the vilest of men gentlemen this is a situation in which a man may be allowed to boast accursed situation no man need envy me the vile and polluted triumph i am now to gain i have called no witnesses to my character great god what sort of character is that which must be supported by witnesses but if i must speak look round the company ask of every one present enquire of your own hearts not one word of reproach was ever whispered against me i do not hesitate to call upon those who have known me most to afford me the most honourable testimony my life has been spent in the keenest and most unintermitted sensibility to reputation i am almost indifferent as to what shall be the event of this day i would not open my mouth upon the occasion if my life were the only thing that was at stake it is not in the power of your decision to restore to me my unblemished reputation to obliterate the disgrace i have suffered or to prevent it from being remembered that i have been brought to examination upon a charge of murder your decision can never have the efficacy to prevent the miserable remains of my existence from being the most intolerable of all burthens i am accused of having committed murder upon the body of barnabas tyrrel i would most joyfully have given every farthing i possess and devoted myself to perpetual beggary to have preserved his life his life was precious to me beyond that of all mankind in my opinion the greatest injustice committed by his unknown assassin was that of defrauding me of my just revenge i confess that i would have called him out to the field and that our encounter should not have been terminated but by the death of one or both of us this would have been a pitiful and inadequate compensation for his unparalleled insult but it was all that remained i ask for no pity but i must openly declare that never was any misfortune so horrible as mine i would willingly have taken refuge from the recollection of that night in a voluntary death life was now stripped of all those recommendations for the sake of which it was dear to me but even this consolation is denied me i am compelled to drag for ever the intolerable load of existence upon penalty if at any period however remote i shake it off of having that impatience regarded as confirming a charge of murder gentlemen if by your decision you could take away my life without that act being connected with my disgrace i would bless the cord that stopped the breath of my existence for ever you all know how easily i might have fled from this purgation if i had been guilty should i not have embraced the opportunity but as it was i could not reputation has been the idol the jewel of my life i could never have borne to think that a human creature in the remotest part of the globe should believe that i was a criminal alas what a deity it is that i have chosen for my worship i have entailed upon myself everlasting agony and despair i have but one word to add gentlemen i charge you to do me the imperfect justice that is in your power my life is a worthless thing but my honour the empty remains of honour i have now to boast is in your judgment and you will each of you from this day have imposed upon yourselves the task of its vindicators it is little that you can do for me but it is not less your duty to do that little may that god who is the fountain of honour and good prosper and protect you the man who now stands before you is devoted to perpetual barrenness and blast he has nothing to hope for beyond the feeble consolation of this day you will easily imagine that mr falkland was discharged with every circumstance of credit nothing is more to be deplored in human institutions than that the ideas of mankind should have annexed a sentiment of disgrace to a purgation thus satisfactory and decisive no one entertained the shadow of a doubt upon the subject and yet a mere concurrence of circumstances made it necessary that the best of men should be publicly put on his defence as if really under suspicion of an atrocious crime it may be granted indeed that mr falkland had his faults but those very faults placed him at a still further distance from the criminality in question he was the fool of honour and fame a man whom in the pursuit of reputation nothing could divert who would have purchased the character of a true gallant and undaunted hero at the expense of worlds and who thought every calamity nominal but a stain upon his honour how atrociously absurd to suppose any motive capable of inducing such a man to play the part of a lurking assassin how unfeeling to oblige him to defend himself from such an imputation did any man and least of all a man of the purest honour ever pass in a moment from a life unstained by a single act of injury to the consummation of human depravity when the decision of the magistrates was declared a general murmur of applause and involuntary transport burst forth from every one present it was at first low and gradually became louder as it was the expression of rapturous delight and an emotion disinterested and divine so there was an indescribable something in the very sound that carried it home to the heart and convinced every spectator that there was no merely personal pleasure which ever existed that would not be foolish and feeble in the comparison every one strove who should most express his esteem of the amiable accused mr falkland was no sooner withdrawn than the gentlemen present determined to give a still further sanction to the business by their congratulations they immediately named a deputation to wait upon him for that purpose every one concurred to assist the general sentiment it was a sort of sympathetic feeling that took hold upon all ranks and degrees the multitude received him with huzzas they took his horses from his carriage dragged him along in triumph and attended him many miles on his return to his own habitation it seemed as if a public examination upon a criminal charge which had hitherto been considered in every event as a brand of disgrace was converted in the present instance into an occasion of enthusiastic adoration and unexampled honour nothing could reach the heart of mr falkland he was not insensible to the general kindness and exertions but it was too evident that the melancholy that had taken hold of his mind was invincible it was only a few weeks after this memorable scene that the real murderer was discovered every part of this story was extraordinary the real murderer was hawkins he was found with his son under a feigned name at a village about thirty miles distant in want of all the necessaries of life he had lived there from the period of his flight in so private a manner that all the enquiries that had been set on foot by the benevolence of mr falkland or the insatiable malice of mr tyrrel had been insufficient to discover him the first thing that had led to the detection was a parcel of clothes covered with blood that were found in a ditch and that when drawn out were known by the people of the village to belong to this man the murder of mr tyrrel was not a circumstance that could be unknown and suspicion was immediately roused a diligent search being made the rusty handle with part of the blade of a knife was found thrown in a corner of his lodging which being applied to a piece of the point of a knife that had been broken in the wound appeared exactly to correspond upon further enquiry two rustics who had been accidentally on the spot remembered to have seen hawkins and his son in the town that very evening and to have called after them and received no answer though they were sure of their persons upon this accumulated evidence both hawkins and his son were tried condemned and afterwards executed in the interval between the sentence and execution hawkins confessed his guilt with many marks of compunction though there are persons by whom this is denied but i have taken some pains to enquire into the fact and am persuaded that their disbelief is precipitate and groundless the cruel injustice that this man had suffered from his villagetyrant was not forgotten upon the present occasion it was by a strange fatality that the barbarous proceedings of mr tyrrel seemed never to fall short of their completion and even his death served eventually to consummate the ruin of a man he hated a circumstance which if it could have come to his knowledge would perhaps have in some measure consoled him for his untimely end this poor hawkins was surely entitled to some pity since his being finally urged to desperation and brought together with his son to an ignominious fate was originally owing to the sturdiness of his virtue and independence but the compassion of the public was in a great measure shut against him as they thought it a piece of barbarous and unpardonable selfishness that he had not rather come boldly forward to meet the consequences of his own conduct than suffer a man of so much public worth as mr falkland and who had been so desirous of doing him good to be exposed to the risk of being tried for a murder that he had committed from this time to the present mr falkland has been nearly such as you at present see him though it be several years since these transactions the impression they made is for ever fresh in the mind of our unfortunate patron from thenceforward his habits became totally different he had before been fond of public scenes and acting a part in the midst of the people among whom he immediately resided he now made himself a rigid recluse he had no associates no friends inconsolable himself he yet wished to treat others with kindness there was a solemn sadness in his manner attended with the most perfect gentleness and humanity every body respects him for his benevolence is unalterable but there is a stately coldness and reserve in his behaviour which makes it difficult for those about him to regard him with the familiarity of affection these symptoms are uninterrupted except at certain times when his sufferings become intolerable and he displays the marks of a furious insanity at those times his language is fearful and mysterious and he seems to figure to himself by turns every sort of persecution and alarm which may be supposed to attend upon an accusation of murder but sensible of his own weakness he is anxious at such times to withdraw into solitude and his domestics in general know nothing of him but the uncommunicative and haughty but mild dejection that accompanies every thing he does  volume the second  chapter i i have stated the narrative of mr collins interspersed with such other information as i was able to collect with all the exactness that my memory assisted by certain memorandums i made at the time will afford i do not pretend to warrant the authenticity of any part of these memoirs except so much as fell under my own knowledge and that part shall be given with the same simplicity and accuracy that i would observe towards a court which was to decide in the last resort upon every thing dear to me the same scrupulous fidelity restrains me from altering the manner of mr collinss narrative to adapt it to the precepts of my own taste and it will soon be perceived how essential that narrative is to the elucidation of my history the intention of my friend in this communication was to give me ease but he in reality added to my embarrassment hitherto i had had no intercourse with the world and its passions and though i was not totally unacquainted with them as they appear in books this proved of little service to me when i came to witness them myself the case seemed entirely altered when the subject of those passions was continually before my eyes and the events had happened but the other day as it were in the very neighbourhood where i lived there was a connection and progress in this narrative which made it altogether unlike the little village incidents i had hitherto known my feelings were successively interested for the different persons that were brought upon the scene my veneration was excited for mr clare and my applause for the intrepidity of mrs hammond i was astonished that any human creature should be so shockingly perverted as mr tyrrel i paid the tribute of my tears to the memory of the artless miss melville i found a thousand fresh reasons to admire and love mr falkland at present i was satisfied with thus considering every incident in its obvious sense but the story i had heard was for ever in my thoughts and i was peculiarly interested to comprehend its full import i turned it a thousand ways and examined it in every point of view in the original communication it appeared sufficiently distinct and satisfactory but as i brooded over it it gradually became mysterious there was something strange in the character of hawkins so firm so sturdily honest and just as he appeared at first all at once to become a murderer his first behaviour under the prosecution how accurately was it calculated to prepossess one in his favour to be sure if he were guilty it was unpardonable in him to permit a man of so much dignity and worth as mr falkland to suffer under the imputation of his crime and yet i could not help bitterly compassionating the honest fellow brought to the gallows as he was strictly speaking by the machinations of that devil incarnate mr tyrrel his son too that son for whom he voluntarily sacrificed his all to die with him at the same tree surely never was a story more affecting was it possible after all that mr falkland should be the murderer the reader will scarcely believe that the idea suggested itself to my mind that i would ask him it was but a passing thought but it serves to mark the simplicity of my character then i recollected the virtues of my master almost too sublime for human nature i thought of his sufferings so unexampled so unmerited and chid myself for the suspicion the dying confession of hawkins recurred to my mind and i felt that there was no longer a possibility of doubting and yet what was the meaning of all mr falklands agonies and terrors in fine the idea having once occurred to my mind it was fixed there for ever my thoughts fluctuated from conjecture to conjecture but this was the centre about which they revolved i determined to place myself as a watch upon my patron the instant i had chosen this employment for myself i found a strange sort of pleasure in it to do what is forbidden always has its charms because we have an indistinct apprehension of something arbitrary and tyrannical in the prohibition to be a spy upon mr falkland that there was danger in the employment served to give an alluring pungency to the choice i remembered the stern reprimand i had received and his terrible looks and the recollection gave a kind of tingling sensation not altogether unallied to enjoyment the further i advanced the more the sensation was irresistible i seemed to myself perpetually upon the brink of being countermined and perpetually roused to guard my designs the more impenetrable mr falkland was determined to be the more uncontrollable was my curiosity through the whole my alarm and apprehension of personal danger had a large mixture of frankness and simplicity conscious of meaning no ill that made me continually ready to say every thing that was upon my mind and would not suffer me to believe that when things were brought to the test any one could be seriously angry with me these reflections led gradually to a new state of my mind when i had first removed into mr falklands family the novelty of the scene rendered me cautious and reserved the distant and solemn manners of my master seemed to have annihilated my constitutional gaiety but the novelty by degrees wore off and my constraint in the same degree diminished the story i had now heard and the curiosity it excited restored to me activity eagerness and courage i had always had a propensity to communicate my thoughts my age was of course inclined to talkativeness and i ventured occasionally in a sort of hesitating way as if questioning whether such a conduct might be allowed to express my sentiments as they arose in the presence of mr falkland the first time i did so he looked at me with an air of surprise made me no answer and presently took occasion to leave me the experiment was soon after repeated my master seemed half inclined to encourage me and yet doubtful whether he might venture he had long been a stranger to pleasure of every sort and my artless and untaught remarks appeared to promise him some amusement could an amusement of this sort be dangerous in this uncertainty he could not probably find it in his heart to treat with severity my innocent effusions i needed but little encouragement for the perturbation of my mind stood in want of this relief my simplicity arising from my being a total stranger to the intercourse of the world was accompanied with a mind in some degree cultivated with reading and perhaps not altogether destitute of observation and talent my remarks were therefore perpetually unexpected at one time implying extreme ignorance and at another some portion of acuteness but at all times having an air of innocence frankness and courage there was still an apparent want of design in the manner even after i was excited accurately to compare my observations and study the inferences to which they led for the effect of old habit was more visible than that of a recently conceived purpose which was yet scarcely mature mr falklands situation was like that of a fish that plays with the bait employed to entrap him by my manner he was in a certain degree encouraged to lay aside his usual reserve and relax his stateliness till some abrupt observation or interrogatory stung him into recollection and brought back his alarm still it was evident that he bore about him a secret wound whenever the cause of his sorrows was touched though in a manner the most indirect and remote his countenance altered his distemper returned and it was with difficulty that he could suppress his emotions sometimes conquering himself with painful effort and sometimes bursting into a sort of paroxysm of insanity and hastening to bury himself in solitude these appearances i too frequently interpreted into grounds of suspicion though i might with equal probability and more liberality have ascribed them to the cruel mortifications he had encountered in the objects of his darling ambition mr collins had strongly urged me to secrecy and mr falkland whenever my gesture or his consciousness impressed him with the idea of my knowing more than i expressed looked at me with wistful earnestness as questioning what was the degree of information i possessed and how it was obtained but again at our next interview the simple vivacity of my manner restored his tranquillity obliterated the emotion of which i had been the cause and placed things afresh in their former situation the longer this humble familiarity on my part had continued the more effort it would require to suppress it and mr falkland was neither willing to mortify me by a severe prohibition of speech nor even perhaps to make me of so much consequence as that prohibition might seem to imply though i was curious it must not be supposed that i had the object of my enquiry for ever in my mind or that my questions and innuendoes were perpetually regulated with the cunning of a greyheaded inquisitor the secret wound of mr falklands mind was much more uniformly present to his recollection than to mine and a thousand times he applied the remarks that occurred in conversation when i had not the remotest idea of such an application till some singularity in his manner brought it back to my thoughts the consciousness of this morbid sensibility and the imagination that its influence might perhaps constitute the whole of the case served probably to spur mr falkland again to the charge and connect a sentiment of shame with every project that suggested itself for interrupting the freedom of our intercourse i will give a specimen of the conversations to which i allude and as it shall be selected from those which began upon topics the most general and remote the reader will easily imagine the disturbance that was almost daily endured by a mind so tremblingly alive as that of my patron pray sir said i one day as i was assisting mr falkland in arranging some papers previously to their being transcribed into his collection how came alexander of macedon to be surnamed the great how came it did you never read his history yes sir well williams and could you find no reasons there why i do not know sir i could find reasons why he should be so famous but every man that is talked of is not admired judges differ about the merits of alexander doctor prideaux says in his connection that he deserves only to be called the great cutthroat and the author of tom jones has written a volume to prove that he and all other conquerors ought to be classed with jonathan wild mr falkland reddened at these citations accursed blasphemy did these authors think that by the coarseness of their ribaldry they could destroy his wellearned fame are learning sensibility and taste no securities to exempt their possessor from this vulgar abuse did you ever read williams of a man more gallant generous and free was ever mortal so completely the reverse of every thing engrossing and selfish he formed to himself a sublime image of excellence and his only ambition was to realise it in his own story remember his giving away every thing when he set out upon his grand expedition professedly reserving for himself nothing but hope recollect his heroic confidence in philip the physician and his entire and unalterable friendship for ephestion he treated the captive family of darius with the most cordial urbanity and the venerable sysigambis with all the tenderness and attention of a son to his mother never take the judgment williams upon such a subject of a clerical pedant or a westminster justice examine for yourself and you will find in alexander a model of honour generosity and disinterestednessâ€”a man who for the cultivated liberality of his mind and the unparalleled grandeur of his projects must stand alone the spectacle and admiration of all ages of the world ah sir it is a fine thing for us to sit here and compose his panegyric but shall i forget what a vast expense was bestowed in erecting the monument of his fame was not he the common disturber of mankind did not he overrun nations that would never have heard of him but for his devastations how many hundred thousands of lives did he sacrifice in his career what must i think of his cruelties a whole tribe massacred for a crime committed by their ancestors one hundred and fifty years before fifty thousand sold into slavery two thousand crucified for their gallant defence of their country man is surely a strange sort of creature who never praises any one more heartily than him who has spread destruction and ruin over the face of nations the way of thinking you express williams is natural enough and i cannot blame you for it but let me hope that you will become more liberal the death of a hundred thousand men is at first sight very shocking but what in reality are a hundred thousand such men more than a hundred thousand sheep it is mind williams the generation of knowledge and virtue that we ought to love this was the project of alexander he set out in a great undertaking to civilise mankind he delivered the vast continent of asia from the stupidity and degradation of the persian monarchy and though he was cut off in the midst of his career we may easily perceive the vast effects of his project grecian literature and cultivation the seleucidae the antiochuses and the ptolemies followed in nations which before had been sunk to the condition of brutes alexander was the builder as notoriously as the destroyer of cities and yet sir i am afraid that the pike and the battleaxe are not the right instruments for making men wise suppose it were admitted that the lives of men were to be sacrificed without remorse if a paramount good were to result it seems to me as if murder and massacre were but a very lefthanded way of producing civilisation and love but pray do not you think this great hero was a sort of a madman what now will you say to his firing the palace of persepolis his weeping for other worlds to conquer and his marching his whole army over the burning sands of libya merely to visit a temple and persuade mankind that he was the son of jupiter ammon alexander my boy has been much misunderstood mankind have revenged themselves upon him by misrepresentation for having so far eclipsed the rest of his species it was necessary to the realising his project that he should pass for a god it was the only way by which he could get a firm hold upon the veneration of the stupid and bigoted persians it was this and not a mad vanity that was the source of his proceeding and how much had he to struggle with in this respect in the unapprehending obstinacy of some of his macedonians why then sir at last alexander did but employ means that all politicians profess to use as well as he he dragooned men into wisdom and cheated them into the pursuit of their own happiness but what is worse sir this alexander in the paroxysm of his headlong rage spared neither friend nor foe you will not pretend to justify the excesses of his ungovernable passion it is impossible sure that a word can be said for a man whom a momentary provocation can hurry into the commission of murdersâ€” the instant i had uttered these words i felt what it was that i had done there was a magnetical sympathy between me and my patron so that their effect was not sooner produced upon him than my own mind reproached me with the inhumanity of the allusion our confusion was mutual the blood forsook at once the transparent complexion of mr falkland and then rushed back again with rapidity and fierceness i dared not utter a word lest i should commit a new error worse than that into which i had just fallen after a short but severe struggle to continue the conversation mr falkland began with trepidation but afterwards became calmerâ€” you are not candidâ€”alexanderâ€”you must learn more clemencyâ€”alexander i say does not deserve this rigour do you remember his tears his remorse his determined abstinence from food which he could scarcely be persuaded to relinquish did not that prove acute feeling and a rooted principle of equityâ€”well well alexander was a true and judicious lover of mankind and his real merits have been little comprehended i know not how to make the state of my mind at that moment accurately understood when one idea has got possession of the soul it is scarcely possible to keep it from finding its way to the lips error once committed has a fascinating power like that ascribed to the eyes of the rattlesnake to draw us into a second error it deprives us of that proud confidence in our own strength to which we are indebted for so much of our virtue curiosity is a restless propensity and often does but hurry us forward the more irresistibly the greater is the danger that attends its indulgence clitus said i was a man of very coarse and provoking manners was he not mr falkland felt the full force of this appeal he gave me a penetrating look as if he would see my very soul his eyes were then in an instant withdrawn i could perceive him seized with a convulsive shuddering which though strongly counteracted and therefore scarcely visible had i know not what of terrible in it he left his employment strode about the room in anger his visage gradually assumed an expression as of supernatural barbarity he quitted the apartment abruptly and flung the door with a violence that seemed to shake the house is this said i the fruit of conscious guilt or of the disgust that a man of honour conceives at guilt undeservedly imputed  chapter ii the reader will feel how rapidly i was advancing to the brink of the precipice i had a confused apprehension of what i was doing but i could not stop myself is it possible said i that mr falkland who is thus overwhelmed with a sense of the unmerited dishonour that has been fastened upon him in the face of the world will long endure the presence of a raw and unfriended youth who is perpetually bringing back that dishonour to his recollection and who seems himself the most forward to entertain the accusation i felt indeed that mr falkland would not hastily incline to dismiss me for the same reason that restrained him from many other actions which might seem to savour of a too tender and ambiguous sensibility but this reflection was little adapted to comfort me that he should cherish in his heart a growing hatred against me and that he should think himself obliged to retain me a continual thorn in his side was an idea by no means of favourable augury to my future peace it was some time after this that in clearing out a case of drawers i found a paper that by some accident had slipped behind one of the drawers and been overlooked at another time perhaps my curiosity might have given way to the laws of decorum and i should have restored it unopened to my master its owner but my eagerness for information had been too much stimulated by the preceding incidents to allow me at present to neglect any occasion of obtaining it the paper proved to be a letter written by the elder hawkins and from its contents seemed to have been penned when he had first been upon the point of absconding from the persecutions of mr tyrrel it was as followsâ€” honourable sir i have waited some time in daily hope of your honours return into these parts old warnes and his dame who are left to take care of your house tell me they cannot say when that will be nor justly in what part of england you are at present for my share misfortune comes so thick upon me that i must determine upon something that is for certain and out of hand our squire who i must own at first used me kindly enough though i am afraid that was partly out of spite to squire underwood has since determined to be the ruin of me sir i have been no craven i fought it up stoutly for after all you know god bless your honour it is but a man to a man but he has been too much for me perhaps if i were to ride over to the markettown and enquire of munsle your lawyer he could tell me how to direct to you but having hoped and waited o this fashion and all in vain has put me upon other thoughts i was in no hurry sir to apply to you for i do not love to be a trouble to any body i kept that for my last stake well sir and now that has failed me like i am ashamed as it were to have thought of it have not i thinks i arms and legs as well as other people i am driven out of house and home well and what then sure i arnt a cabbage that if you pull it out of the ground it must die i am pennyless true and how many hundreds are there that live from hand to mouth all the days of their life begging your honours pardon thinks i if we little folks had but the wit to do for ourselves the great folks would not be such maggotty changelings as they are they would begin to look about them but there is another thing that has swayed with me more than all the rest i do not know how to tell you sirâ€”my poor boy my leonard the pride of my life has been three weeks in the county jail it is true indeed sir squire tyrrel put him there now sir every time that i lay my head upon my pillow under my own little roof my heart smites me with the situation of my leonard i do not mean so much for the hardship i do not so much matter that i do not expect him to go through the world upon velvet i am not such a fool but who can tell what may hap in a jail i have been three times to see him and there is one man in the same quarter of the prison that looks so wicked i do not much fancy the looks of the rest to be sure leonard is as good a lad as ever lived i think he will not give his mind to such but come what will i am determined he shall not stay among them twelve hours longer i am an obstinate old fool perhaps but i have taken it into my head and i will do it do not ask me what but if i were to write to your honour and wait for your answer it might take a week or ten days more i must not think of it squire tyrrel is very headstrong and you your honour might be a little hottish or so no i would not have any body quarrel for me there has been mischief enough done already and i will get myself out of the way so i write this your honour merely to unload my mind i feel myself equally as much bound to respect and love you as if you had done every thing for me that i believe you would have done if things had chanced differently it is most likely you will never hear of me any more if it should be so set your worthy heart at rest i know myself too well ever to be tempted to do any thing that is really bad i have now my fortune to seek in the world i have been used ill enough god knows but i bear no malice my heart is at peace with all mankind and i forgive every body it is like enough that poor leonard and i may have hardship enough to undergo among strangers and being obliged to hide ourselves like housebreakers or highwaymen but i defy all the malice of fortune to make us do an ill thing that consolation we will always keep against all the crosses of a heartbreaking world god bless you so prays your honours humble servant to command benjamin hawkins i read this letter with considerable attention and it occasioned me many reflections to my way of thinking it contained a very interesting picture of a blunt downright honest mind it is a melancholy consideration said i to myself but such is man to have judged from appearances one would have said this is a fellow to have taken fortunes buffets and rewards with an incorruptible mind and yet see where it all ends this man was capable of afterwards becoming a murderer and finished his life at the gallows o poverty thou art indeed omnipotent thou grindest us into desperation thou confoundest all our boasted and most deeprooted principles thou fillest us to the very brim with malice and revenge and renderest us capable of acts of unknown horror may i never be visited by thee in the fulness of thy power having satisfied my curiosity with respect to this paper i took care to dispose of it in such a manner as that it should be found by mr falkland at the same time that in obedience to the principle which at present governed me with absolute dominion i was willing that the way in which it offered itself to his attention should suggest to him the idea that it had possibly passed through my hands the next morning i saw him and i exerted myself to lead the conversation which by this time i well knew how to introduce by insensible degrees to the point i desired after several previous questions remarks and rejoinders i continuedâ€” well sir after all i cannot help feeling very uncomfortably as to my ideas of human nature when i find that there is no dependence to be placed upon its perseverance and that at least among the illiterate the most promising appearances may end in the foulest disgrace you think then that literature and a cultivated mind are the only assurance for the constancy of our principles humphwhy do you suppose sir that learning and ingenuity do not often serve people rather to hide their crimes than to restrain them from committing them history tells us strange things in that respect williams said mr falkland a little disturbed you are extremely given to censure and severity i hope not i am sure i am most fond of looking on the other side of the picture and considering how many men have been aspersed and even at some time or other almost torn to pieces by their fellowcreatures whom when properly understood we find worthy of our reverence and love indeed replied mr falkland with a sigh when i consider these things i do not wonder at the dying exclamation of brutus o virtue i sought thee as a substance but i find thee an empty name i am too much inclined to be of his opinion why to be sure sir innocence and guilt are too much confounded in human life i remember an affecting story of a poor man in the reign of queen elizabeth who would have infallibly been hanged for murder upon the strength of circumstantial evidence if the person really concerned had not been himself upon the jury and prevented it in saying this i touched the spring that wakened madness in his mind he came up to me with a ferocious countenance as if determined to force me into a confession of my thoughts a sudden pang however seemed to change his design he drew back with trepidation and exclaimed detested be the universe and the laws that govern it honour justice virtue are all the juggle of knaves if it were in my power i would instantly crush the whole system into nothing i replied oh sir things are not so bad as you imagine the world was made for men of sense to do what they will with its affairs cannot be better than in the direction of the genuine heroes and as in the end they will be found the truest friends of the whole so the multitude have nothing to do but to look on be fashioned and admire mr falkland made a powerful effort to recover his tranquillity williams said he you instruct me well you have a right notion of things and i have great hopes of you i will be more of a man i will forget the past and do better for the time to come the future the future is always our own i am sorry sir that i have given you pain i am afraid to say all that i think but it is my opinion that mistakes will ultimately be cleared up justice done and the true state of things come to light in spite of the false colours that may for a time obscure it the idea i suggested did not give mr falkland the proper degree of delight he suffered a temporary relapse justiceâ€”he muttered i do not know what is justice my case is not within the reach of common remedies perhaps of none i only know that i am miserable i began life with the best intentions and the most fervid philanthropy and here i amâ€”miserableâ€”miserable beyond expression or endurance having said this he seemed suddenly to recollect himself and reassumed his accustomed dignity and command how came this conversation cried he who gave you a right to be my confidant base artful wretch that you are learn to be more respectful are my passions to be wound and unwound by an insolent domestic do you think i will be an instrument to be played on at your pleasure till you have extorted all the treasures of my soul begone and fear lest you be made to pay for the temerity you have already committed there was an energy and determination in the gestures with which these words were accompanied that did not admit of their being disputed my mouth was closed i felt as if deprived of all share of activity and was only able silently and passively to quit the apartment  chapter iii two days subsequent to this conversation mr falkland ordered me to be called to him i shall continue to speak in my narrative of the silent as well as the articulate part of the intercourse between us his countenance was habitually animated and expressive much beyond that of any other man i have seen the curiosity which as i have said constituted my ruling passion stimulated me to make it my perpetual study it will also most probably happen while i am thus employed in collecting the scattered incidents of my history that i shall upon some occasions annex to appearances an explanation which i was far from possessing at the time and was only suggested to me through the medium of subsequent events when i entered the apartment i remarked in mr falklands countenance an unwonted composure this composure however did not seem to result from internal ease but from an effort which while he prepared himself for an interesting scene was exerted to prevent his presence of mind and power of voluntary action from suffering any diminution williams said he i am determined whatever it may cost me to have an explanation with you you are a rash and inconsiderate boy and have given me much disturbance you ought to have known that though i allow you to talk with me upon indifferent subjects it is very improper in you to lead the conversation to any thing that relates to my personal concerns you have said many things lately in a very mysterious way and appear to know something more than i am aware of i am equally at a loss to guess how you came by your knowledge as of what it consists but i think i perceive too much inclination on your part to trifle with my peace of mind that ought not to be nor have i deserved any such treatment from you but be that as it will the guesses in which you oblige me to employ myself are too painful it is a sort of sporting with my feelings which as a man of resolution i am determined to bring to an end i expect you therefore to lay aside all mystery and equivocation and inform me explicitly what it is upon which your allusions are built what is it you know what is it you want i have been too much exposed already to unparalleled mortification and hardship and my wounds will not bear this perpetual tampering i feel sir answered i how wrong i have been and am ashamed that such a one as i should have given you all this trouble and displeasure i felt it at the time but i have been hurried along i do not know how i have always tried to stop myself but the demon that possessed me was too strong for me i know nothing sir but what mr collins told me he told me the story of mr tyrrel and miss melville and hawkins i am sure sir he said nothing but what was to your honour and proved you to be more an angel than a man well sir i found a letter written by that hawkins the other day did not that letter fall into your hands did not you read it for gods sake sir turn me out of your house punish me in some way or other that i may forgive myself i am a foolish wicked despicable wretch i confess sir i did read the letter and how dared you read it it was indeed very wrong of you but we will talk of that by and by well and what did you say to the letter you know it seems that hawkins was hanged i say sir why it went to my heart to read it i say as i said the day before yesterday that when i see a man of so much principle afterwards deliberately proceeding to the very worst of crimes i can scarcely bear to think of it that is what you say it seems too you knowâ€”accursed remembrancethat i was accused of this crime i was silent well sir you know too perhaps that from the hour the crime was committedâ€”yes sir that was the date and as he said this there was somewhat frightful i had almost said diabolical in his countenanceâ€”i have not had an hours peace i became changed from the happiest to the most miserable thing that lives sleep has fled from my eyes joy has been a stranger to my thoughts and annihilation i should prefer a thousand times to the being that i am as soon as i was capable of a choice i chose honour and the esteem of mankind as a good i preferred to all others you know it seems in how many ways my ambition has been disappointedâ€”i do not thank collins for having been the historian of my disgraceâ€”would to god that night could be blotted from the memory of manbut the scene of that night instead of perishing has been a source of ever new calamity to me which must flow for ever am i then thus miserable and ruined a proper subject upon which for you to exercise your ingenuity and improve your power of tormenting was it not enough that i was publicly dishonoured that i was deprived by the pestilential influence of some demon of the opportunity of avenging my dishonour no in addition to this i have been charged with having in this critical moment intercepted my own vengeance by the foulest of crimes that trial is past misery itself has nothing worse in store for me except what you have inflicted the seeming to doubt of my innocence which after the fullest and most solemn examination has been completely established you have forced me to this explanation you have extorted from me a confidence which i had no inclination to make but it is a part of the misery of my situation that i am at the mercy of every creature however little who feels himself inclined to sport with my distress be content you have brought me low enough oh sir i am not content i cannot be content i cannot bear to think what i have done i shall never again be able to look in the face of the best of masters and the best of men i beg of you sir to turn me out of your service let me go and hide myself where i may never see you more mr falklands countenance had indicated great severity through the whole of this conversation but now it became more harsh and tempestuous than ever how now rascal cried he you want to leave me do you who told you that i wished to part with you but you cannot bear to live with such a miserable wretch as i am you are not disposed to put up with the caprices of a man so dissatisfied and unjust oh sir do not talk to me thus do with me any thing you will kill me if you please kill you volumes could not describe the emotions with which this echo of my words was given and received sir i could die to serve you i love you more than i can express i worship you as a being of a superior nature i am foolish raw inexperiencedâ€”worse than any of theseâ€”but never did a thought of disloyalty to your service enter into my heart here our conversation ended and the impression it made upon my youthful mind it is impossible to describe i thought with astonishment even with rapture of the attention and kindness towards me i discovered in mr falkland through all the roughness of his manner i could never enough wonder at finding myself humble as i was by my birth obscure as i had hitherto been thus suddenly become of so much importance to the happiness of one of the most enlightened and accomplished men in england but this consciousness attached me to my patron more eagerly than ever and made me swear a thousand times as i meditated upon my situation that i would never prove unworthy of so generous a protector  chapter iv is it not unaccountable that in the midst of all my increased veneration for my patron the first tumult of my emotion was scarcely subsided before the old question that had excited my conjectures recurred to my mind was he the murderer it was a kind of fatal impulse that seemed destined to hurry me to my destruction i did not wonder at the disturbance that was given to mr falkland by any allusion however distant to this fatal affair that was as completely accounted for from the consideration of his excessive sensibility in matters of honour as it would have been upon the supposition of the most atrocious guilt knowing as he did that such a charge had once been connected with his name he would of course be perpetually uneasy and suspect some latent insinuation at every possible opportunity he would doubt and fear lest every man with whom he conversed harboured the foulest suspicion against him in my case he found that i was in possession of some information more than he was aware of without its being possible for him to decide to what it amounted whether i had heard a just or unjust a candid or calumniatory tale he had also reason to suppose that i gave entertainment to thoughts derogatory to his honour and that i did not form that favourable judgment which the exquisite refinement of his ruling passion made indispensable to his peace all these considerations would of course maintain in him a state of perpetual uneasiness but though i could find nothing that i could consider as justifying me in persisting in the shadow of a doubt yet as i have said the uncertainty and restlessness of my contemplations would by no means depart from me the fluctuating state of my mind produced a contention of opposite principles that by turns usurped dominion over my conduct sometimes i was influenced by the most complete veneration for my master i placed an unreserved confidence in his integrity and his virtue and implicitly surrendered my understanding for him to set it to what point he pleased at other times the confidence which had before flowed with the most plenteous tide began to ebb i was as i had already been watchful inquisitive suspicious full of a thousand conjectures as to the meaning of the most indifferent actions mr falkland who was most painfully alive to every thing that related to his honour saw these variations and betrayed his consciousness of them now in one manner and now in another frequently before i was myself aware sometimes almost before they existed the situation of both was distressing we were each of us a plague to the other and i often wondered that the forbearance and benignity of my master was not at length exhausted and that he did not determine to thrust from him for ever so incessant an observer there was indeed one eminent difference between his share in the transaction and mine i had some consolation in the midst of my restlessness curiosity is a principle that carries its pleasures as well as its pains along with it the mind is urged by a perpetual stimulus it seems as if it were continually approaching to the end of its race and as the insatiable desire of satisfaction is its principle of conduct so it promises itself in that satisfaction an unknown gratification which seems as if it were capable of fully compensating any injuries that may be suffered in the career but to mr falkland there was no consolation what he endured in the intercourse between us appeared to be gratuitous evil he had only to wish that there was no such person as myself in the world and to curse the hour when his humanity led him to rescue me from my obscurity and place me in his service a consequence produced upon me by the extraordinary nature of my situation it is necessary to mention the constant state of vigilance and suspicion in which my mind was retained worked a very rapid change in my character it seemed to have all the effect that might have been expected from years of observation and experience the strictness with which i endeavoured to remark what passed in the mind of one man and the variety of conjectures into which i was led appeared as it were to render me a competent adept in the different modes in which the human intellect displays its secret workings i no longer said to myself as i had done in the beginning i will ask mr falkland whether he were the murderer on the contrary after having carefully examined the different kinds of evidence of which the subject was susceptible and recollecting all that had already passed upon the subject it was not without considerable pain that i felt myself unable to discover any way in which i could be perfectly and unalterably satisfied of my patrons innocence as to his guilt i could scarcely bring myself to doubt that in some way or other sooner or later i should arrive at the knowledge of that if it really existed but i could not endure to think almost for a moment of that side of the alternative as true and with all my ungovernable suspicion arising from the mysteriousness of the circumstances and all the delight which a young and unfledged mind receives from ideas that give scope to all that imagination can picture of terrible or sublime i could not yet bring myself to consider mr falklands guilt as a supposition attended with the remotest probability i hope the reader will forgive me for dwelling thus long on preliminary circumstances i shall come soon enough to the story of my own misery i have already said that one of the motives which induced me to the penning of this narrative was to console myself in my insupportable distress i derive a melancholy pleasure from dwelling upon the circumstances which imperceptibly paved the way to my ruin while i recollect or describe past scenes which occurred in a more favourable period of my life my attention is called off for a short interval from the hopeless misfortune in which i am at present involved the man must indeed possess an uncommon portion of hardness of heart who can envy me so slight a reliefâ€”to proceed for some time after the explanation which had thus taken place between me and mr falkland his melancholy instead of being in the slightest degree diminished by the lenient hand of time went on perpetually to increase his fits of insanityâ€”for such i must denominate them for want of a distinct appellation though it is possible they might not fall under the definition that either the faculty or the court of chancery appropriate to the termâ€”became stronger and more durable than ever it was no longer practicable wholly to conceal them from the family and even from the neighbourhood he would sometimes without any previous notice absent himself from his house for two or three days unaccompanied by servant or attendant this was the more extraordinary as it was well known that he paid no visits nor kept up any sort of intercourse with the gentlemen of the vicinity but it was impossible that a man of mr falklands distinction and fortune should long continue in such a practice without its being discovered what was become of him though a considerable part of our county was among the wildest and most desolate districts that are to be found in south britain mr falkland was sometimes seen climbing among the rocks reclining motionless for hours together upon the edge of a precipice or lulled into a kind of nameless lethargy of despair by the dashing of the torrents he would remain for whole nights together under the naked cope of heaven inattentive to the consideration either of place or time insensible to the variations of the weather or rather seeming to be delighted with that uproar of the elements which partially called off his attention from the discord and dejection that occupied his own mind at first when we received intelligence at any time of the place to which mr falkland had withdrawn himself some person of his household mr collins or myself but most generally myself as i was always at home and always in the received sense of the word at leisure went to him to persuade him to return but after a few experiments we thought it advisable to desist and leave him to prolong his absence or to terminate it as might happen to suit his own inclination mr collins whose grey hairs and long services seemed to give him a sort of right to be importunate sometimes succeeded though even in that case there was nothing that could sit more uneasily upon mr falkland than this insinuation as if he wanted a guardian to take care of him or as if he were in or in danger of falling into a state in which he would be incapable of deliberately controlling his own words and actions at one time he would suddenly yield to his humble venerable friend murmuring grievously at the constraint that was put upon him but without spirit enough even to complain of it with energy at another time even though complying he would suddenly burst out in a paroxysm of resentment upon these occasions there was something inconceivably savagely terrible in his anger that gave to the person against whom it was directed the most humiliating and insupportable sensations me he always treated at these times with fierceness and drove me from him with a vehemence lofty emphatical and sustained beyond any thing of which i should have thought human nature to be capable these sallies seemed always to constitute a sort of crisis in his indisposition and whenever he was induced to such a premature return he would fall immediately after into a state of the most melancholy inactivity in which he usually continued for two or three days it was by an obstinate fatality that whenever i saw mr falkland in these deplorable situations and particularly when i lighted upon him after having sought him among the rocks and precipices pale emaciated solitary and haggard the suggestion would continually recur to me in spite of inclination in spite of persuasion and in spite of evidence surely this man is a murderer  chapter v it was in one of the lucid intervals as i may term them that occurred during this period that a peasant was brought before him in his character of a justice of peace upon an accusation of having murdered his fellow as mr falkland had by this time acquired the repute of a melancholy valetudinarian it is probable he would not have been called upon to act in his official character upon the present occasion had it not been that two or three of the neighbouring justices were all of them from home at once so that he was the only one to be found in a circuit of many miles the reader however must not imagine though i have employed the word insanity in describing mr falklands symptoms that he was by any means reckoned for a madman by the generality of those who had occasion to observe him it is true that his behaviour at certain times was singular and unaccountable but then at other times there was in it so much dignity regularity and economy he knew so well how to command and make himself respected his actions and carriage were so condescending considerate and benevolent that far from having forfeited the esteem of the unfortunate or the many they were loud and earnest in his praises i was present at the examination of this peasant the moment i heard of the errand which had brought this rabble of visitors a sudden thought struck me i conceived the possibility of rendering the incident subordinate to the great enquiry which drank up all the currents of my soul i said this man is arraigned of murder and murder is the masterkey that wakes distemper in the mind of mr falkland i will watch him without remission i will trace all the mazes of his thought surely at such a time his secret anguish must betray itself surely if it be not my own fault i shall now be able to discover the state of his plea before the tribunal of unerring justice i took my station in a manner most favourable to the object upon which my mind was intent i could perceive in mr falklands features as he entered a strong reluctance to the business in which he was engaged but there was no possibility of retreating his countenance was embarrassed and anxious he scarcely saw any body the examination had not proceeded far before he chanced to turn his eye to the part of the room where i was it happened in this as in some preceding instancesâ€”we exchanged a silent look by which we told volumes to each other mr falklands complexion turned from red to pale and from pale to red i perfectly understood his feelings and would willingly have withdrawn myself but it was impossible my passions were too deeply engaged i was rooted to the spot though my own life that of my master or almost of a whole nation had been at stake i had no power to change my position the first surprise however having subsided mr falkland assumed a look of determined constancy and even seemed to increase in selfpossession much beyond what could have been expected from his first entrance this he could probably have maintained had it not been that the scene instead of being permanent was in some sort perpetually changing the man who was brought before him was vehemently accused by the brother of the deceased as having acted from the most rooted malice he swore that there had been an old grudge between the parties and related several instances of it he affirmed that the murderer had sought the earliest opportunity of wreaking his revenge had struck the first blow and though the contest was in appearance only a common boxing match had watched the occasion of giving a fatal stroke which was followed by the instant death of his antagonist while the accuser was giving in his evidence the accused discovered every token of the most poignant sensibility at one time his features were convulsed with anguish tears unbidden trickled down his manly cheeks and at another he started with apparent astonishment at the unfavourable turn that was given to the narrative though without betraying any impatience to interrupt i never saw a man less ferocious in his appearance he was tall well made and comely his countenance was ingenuous and benevolent without folly by his side stood a young woman his sweetheart extremely agreeable in her person and her looks testifying how deeply she interested herself in the fate of her lover the accidental spectators were divided between indignation against the enormity of the supposed criminal and compassion for the poor girl that accompanied him they seemed to take little notice of the favourable appearances visible in the person of the accused till in the sequel those appearances were more forcibly suggested to their attention for mr falkland he was at one moment engrossed by curiosity and earnestness to investigate the tale while at another he betrayed a sort of revulsion of sentiment which made the investigation too painful for him to support when the accused was called upon for his defence he readily owned the misunderstanding that had existed and that the deceased was the worst enemy he had in the world indeed he was his only enemy and he could not tell the reason that had made him so he had employed every effort to overcome his animosity but in vain the deceased had upon all occasions sought to mortify him and do him an ill turn but he had resolved never to be engaged in a broil with him and till this day he had succeeded if he had met with a misfortune with any other man people at least might have thought it accident but now it would always be believed that he had acted from secret malice and a bad heart the fact was that he and his sweetheart had gone to a neighbouring fair where this man had met them the man had often tried to affront him and his passiveness interpreted into cowardice had perhaps encouraged the other to additional rudeness finding that he had endured trivial insults to himself with an even temper the deceased now thought proper to turn his brutality upon the young woman that accompanied him he pursued them he endeavoured in various manners to harass and vex them they had sought in vain to shake him off the young woman was considerably terrified the accused expostulated with their persecutor and asked him how he could be so barbarous as to persist in frightening a woman he replied with an insulting tone then the woman should find some one able to protect her people that encouraged and trusted to such a thief as that deserved no better the accused tried every expedient he could invent at length he could endure it no longer he became exasperated and challenged the assailant the challenge was accepted a ring was formed he confided the care of his sweetheart to a bystander and unfortunately the first blow he struck proved fatal the accused added that he did not care what became of him he had been anxious to go through the world in an inoffensive manner and now he had the guilt of blood upon him he did not know but it would be kindness in them to hang him out of the way for his conscience would reproach him as long as he lived and the figure of the deceased as he had lain senseless and without motion at his feet would perpetually haunt him the thought of this man at one moment full of life and vigour and the next lifted a helpless corpse from the ground and all owing to him was a thought too dreadful to be endured he had loved the poor maiden who had been the innocent occasion of this with all his heart but from this time he should never support the sight of her the sight would bring a tribe of fiends in its rear one unlucky minute had poisoned all his hopes and made life a burden to him saying this his countenance fell the muscles of his face trembled with agony and he looked the statue of despair this was the story of which mr falkland was called upon to be the auditor though the incidents were for the most part wide of those which belonged to the adventures of the preceding volume and there had been much less policy and skill displayed on either part in this rustic encounter yet there were many points which to a man who bore the former strongly in his recollection suggested a sufficient resemblance in each case it was a human brute persisting in a course of hostility to a man of benevolent character and suddenly and terribly cut off in the midst of his career these points perpetually smote upon the heart of mr falkland he at one time started with astonishment and at another shifted his posture like a man who is unable longer to endure the sensations that press upon him then he new strung his nerves to stubborn patience i could see while his muscles preserved an inflexible steadiness tears of anguish roll down his cheeks he dared not trust his eyes to glance towards the side of the room where i stood and this gave an air of embarrassment to his whole figure but when the accused came to speak of his feelings to describe the depth of his compunction for an involuntary fault he could endure it no longer he suddenly rose and with every mark of horror and despair rushed out of the room this circumstance made no material difference in the affair of the accused the parties were detained about half an hour mr falkland had already heard the material parts of the evidence in person at the expiration of that interval he sent for mr collins out of the room the story of the culprit was confirmed by many witnesses who had seen the transaction word was brought that my master was indisposed and at the same time the accused was ordered to be discharged the vengeance of the brother however as i afterwards found did not rest here and he met with a magistrate more scrupulous or more despotic by whom the culprit was committed for trial this affair was no sooner concluded than i hastened into the garden and plunged into the deepest of its thickets my mind was full almost to bursting i no sooner conceived myself sufficiently removed from all observation than my thoughts forced their way spontaneously to my tongue and i exclaimed in a fit of uncontrollable enthusiasm this is the murderer the hawkinses were innocent i am sure of it i will pledge my life for it it is out it is discovered guilty upon my soul while i thus proceeded with hasty steps along the most secret paths of the garden and from time to time gave vent to the tumult of my thoughts in involuntary exclamations i felt as if my animal system had undergone a total revolution my blood boiled within me i was conscious to a kind of rapture for which i could not account i was solemn yet full of rapid emotion burning with indignation and energy in the very tempest and hurricane of the passions i seemed to enjoy the most soulravishing calm i cannot better express the then state of my mind than by saying i was never so perfectly alive as at that moment this state of mental elevation continued for several hours but at length subsided and gave place to more deliberate reflection one of the first questions that then occurred was what shall i do with the knowledge i have been so eager to acquire i had no inclination to turn informer i felt what i had had no previous conception of that it was possible to love a murderer and as i then understood it the worst of murderers i conceived it to be in the highest degree absurd and iniquitous to cut off a man qualified for the most essential and extensive utility merely out of retrospect to an act which whatever were its merits could not be retrieved this thought led me to another which had at first passed unnoticed if i had been disposed to turn informer what had occurred amounted to no evidence that was admissible in a court of justice well then added i if it be such as would not be admitted at a criminal tribunal am i sure it is such as i ought to admit there were twenty persons besides myself present at the scene from which i pretend to derive such entire conviction not one of them saw it in the light that i did it either appeared to them a casual and unimportant circumstance or they thought it sufficiently accounted for by mr falklands infirmity and misfortunes did it really contain such an extent of arguments and application that nobody but i was discerning enough to see but all this reasoning produced no alteration in my way of thinking for this time i could not get it out of my mind for a moment mr falkland is the murderer he is guilty i see it i feel it i am sure of it thus was i hurried along by an uncontrollable destiny the state of my passions in their progressive career the inquisitiveness and impatience of my thoughts appeared to make this determination unavoidable an incident occurred while i was in the garden that seemed to make no impression upon me at the time but which i recollected when my thoughts were got into somewhat of a slower motion in the midst of one of my paroxysms of exclamation and when i thought myself most alone the shadow of a man as avoiding me passed transiently by me at a small distance though i had scarcely caught a faint glimpse of his person there was something in the occurrence that persuaded me it was mr falkland i shuddered at the possibility of his having overheard the words of my soliloquy but this idea alarming as it was had not power immediately to suspend the career of my reflections subsequent circumstances however brought back the apprehension to my mind i had scarcely a doubt of its reality when dinnertime came and mr falkland was not to be found supper and bedtime passed in the same manner the only conclusion made by his servants upon this circumstance was that he was gone upon one of his accustomed melancholy rambles  chapter vi the period at which my story is now arrived seemed as if it were the very crisis of the fortune of mr falkland incident followed upon incident in a kind of breathless succession about nine oclock the next morning an alarm was given that one of the chimneys of the house was on fire no accident could be apparently more trivial but presently it blazed with such fury as to make it clear that some beam of the house which in the first building had been improperly placed had been reached by the flames some danger was apprehended for the whole edifice the confusion was the greater in consequence of the absence of the master as well as of mr collins the steward while some of the domestics were employed in endeavouring to extinguish the flames it was thought proper that others should busy themselves in removing the most valuable moveables to a lawn in the garden i took some command in the affair to which indeed my station in the family seemed to entitle me and for which i was judged qualified by my understanding and mental resources having given some general directions i conceived that it was not enough to stand by and superintend but that i should contribute my personal labour in the public concern i set out for that purpose and my steps by some mysterious fatality were directed to the private apartment at the end of the library here as i looked round my eye was suddenly caught by the trunk mentioned in the first pages of my narrative my mind was already raised to its utmost pitch in a windowseat of the room lay a number of chisels and other carpenters tools i know not what infatuation instantaneously seized me the idea was too powerful to be resisted i forgot the business upon which i came the employment of the servants and the urgency of general danger i should have done the same if the flames that seemed to extend as they proceeded and already surmounted the house had reached this very apartment i snatched a tool suitable for the purpose threw myself upon the ground and applied with eagerness to a magazine which inclosed all for which my heart panted after two or three efforts in which the energy of uncontrollable passion was added to my bodily strength the fastenings gave way the trunk opened and all that i sought was at once within my reach i was in the act of lifting up the lid when mr falkland entered wild breathless distracted in his looks he had been brought home from a considerable distance by the sight of the flames at the moment of his appearance the lid dropped down from my hand he no sooner saw me than his eyes emitted sparks of rage he ran with eagerness to a brace of loaded pistols which hung in the room and seizing one presented it to my head i saw his design and sprang to avoid it but with the same rapidity with which he had formed his resolution he changed it and instantly went to the window and flung the pistol into the court below he bade me begone with his usual irresistible energy and overcome as i was already by the horror of the detection i eagerly complied a moment after a considerable part of the chimney tumbled with noise into the court below and a voice exclaimed that the fire was more violent than ever these circumstances seemed to produce a mechanical effect upon my patron who having first locked the closet appeared on the outside of the house ascended the roof and was in a moment in every place where his presence was required the flames were at length extinguished the reader can with difficulty form a conception of the state to which i was now reduced my act was in some sort an act of insanity but how undescribable are the feelings with which i looked back upon it it was an instantaneous impulse a shortlived and passing alienation of mind but what must mr falkland think of that alienation to any man a person who had once shown himself capable of so wild a flight of the mind must appear dangerous how must he appear to a man under mr falklands circumstances i had just had a pistol held to my head by a man resolved to put a period to my existence that indeed was past but what was it that fate had yet in reserve for me the insatiable vengeance of a falkland of a man whose hands were to my apprehension red with blood and his thoughts familiar with cruelty and murder how great were the resources of his mind resources henceforth to be confederated for my destruction this was the termination of an ungoverned curiosity an impulse that i had represented to myself as so innocent or so venial in the high tide of boiling passion i had overlooked all consequences it now appeared to me like a dream is it in man to leap from the highraised precipice or rush unconcerned into the midst of flames was it possible i could have forgotten for a moment the awecreating manners of falkland and the inexorable fury i should awake in his soul no thought of future security had reached my mind i had acted upon no plan i had conceived no means of concealing my deed after it had once been effected but it was over now one short minute had effected a reverse in my situation the suddenness of which the history of man perhaps is unable to surpass i have always been at a loss to account for my having plunged thus headlong into an act so monstrous there is something in it of unexplained and involuntary sympathy one sentiment flows by necessity of nature into another sentiment of the same general character this was the first instance in which i had witnessed a danger by fire all was confusion around me and all changed into hurricane within the general situation to my unpractised apprehension appeared desperate and i by contagion became alike desperate at first i had been in some degree calm and collected but that too was a desperate effort and when it gave way a kind of instant insanity became its successor i had now every thing to fear and yet what was my fault it proceeded from none of those errors which are justly held up to the aversion of mankind my object had been neither wealth nor the means of indulgence nor the usurpation of power no spark of malignity had harboured in my soul i had always reverenced the sublime mind of mr falkland i reverenced it still my offence had merely been a mistaken thirst of knowledge such however it was as to admit neither of forgiveness nor remission this epoch was the crisis of my fate dividing what may be called the offensive part from the defensive which has been the sole business of my remaining years alas my offence was short not aggravated by any sinister intention but the reprisals i was to suffer are long and can terminate only with my life in the state in which i found myself when the recollection of what i had done flowed back upon my mind i was incapable of any resolution all was chaos and uncertainty within me my thoughts were too full of horror to be susceptible of activity i felt deserted of my intellectual powers palsied in mind and compelled to sit in speechless expectation of the misery to which i was destined to my own conception i was like a man who though blasted with lightning and deprived for ever of the power of motion should yet retain the consciousness of his situation deathdealing despair was the only idea of which i was sensible i was still in this situation of mind when mr falkland sent for me his message roused me from my trance in recovering i felt those sickening and loathsome sensations which a man may be supposed at first to endure who should return from the sleep of death gradually i recovered the power of arranging my ideas and directing my steps i understood that the minute the affair of the fire was over mr falkland had retired to his own room it was evening before he ordered me to be called i found in him every token of extreme distress except that there was an air of solemn and sad composure that crowned the whole for the present all appearance of gloom stateliness and austerity was gone as i entered he looked up and seeing who it was ordered me to bolt the door i obeyed he went round the room and examined its other avenues he then returned to where i stood i trembled in every joint of my frame i exclaimed within myself what scene of death has roscius now to act williams said he in a tone which had more in it of sorrow than resentment i have attempted your life i am a wretch devoted to the scorn and execration of mankind there he stopped if there be one being on the whole earth that feels the scorn and execration due to such a wretch more strongly than another it is myself i have been kept in a state of perpetual torture and madness but i can put an end to it and its consequences and so far at least as relates to you i am determined to do it i know the price andâ€”i will make the purchase you must swear said he you must attest every sacrament divine and human never to disclose what i am now to tell youâ€”he dictated the oath and i repeated it with an aching heart i had no power to offer a word of remark this confidence said he is of your seeking not of mine it is odious to me and is dangerous to you having thus prefaced the disclosure he had to make he paused he seemed to collect himself as for an effort of magnitude he wiped his face with his handkerchief the moisture that incommoded him appeared not to be tears but sweat look at me observe me is it not strange that such a one as i should retain lineaments of a human creature i am the blackest of villains i am the murderer of tyrrel i am the assassin of the hawkinses i started with terror and was silent what a story is mine insulted disgraced polluted in the face of hundreds i was capable of any act of desperation i watched my opportunity followed mr tyrrel from the rooms seized a sharppointed knife that fell in my way came behind him and stabbed him to the heart my gigantic oppressor rolled at my feet all are but links of one chain a blow a murder my next business was to defend myself to tell so welldigested a lie as that all mankind should believe it true never was a task so harrowing and intolerable well thus far fortune favoured me she favoured me beyond my desire the guilt was removed from me and cast upon another but this i was to endure whence came the circumstantial evidence against him the broken knife and the blood i am unable to tell i suppose by some miraculous accident hawkins was passing by and endeavoured to assist his oppressor in the agonies of death you have heard his story you have read one of his letters but you do not know the thousandth part of the proofs of his simple and unalterable rectitude that i have known his son suffered with him that son for the sake of whose happiness and virtue he ruined himself and would have died a hundred timesâ€”i have had feelings but i cannot describe them this it is to be a gentleman a man of honour i was the fool of fame my virtue my honesty my everlasting peace of mind were cheap sacrifices to be made at the shrine of this divinity but what is worse there is nothing that has happened that has in any degree contributed to my cure i am as much the fool of fame as ever i cling to it to my last breath though i be the blackest of villains i will leave behind me a spotless and illustrious name there is no crime so malignant no scene of blood so horrible in which that object cannot engage me it is no matter that i regard these things at a distance with aversionâ€”i am sure of it bring me to the test and i shall yield i despise myself but thus i am things are gone too far to be recalled why is it that i am compelled to this confidence from the love of fame i should tremble at the sight of every pistol or instrument of death that offered itself to my hands and perhaps my next murder may not be so fortunate as those i have already committed i had no alternative but to make you my confidant or my victim it was better to trust you with the whole truth under every seal of secrecy than to live in perpetual fear of your penetration or your rashness do you know what it is you have done to gratify a foolishly inquisitive humour you have sold yourself you shall continue in my service but can never share my affection i will benefit you in respect of fortune but i shall always hate you if ever an unguarded word escape from your lips if ever you excite my jealousy or suspicion expect to pay for it by your death or worse it is a dear bargain you have made but it is too late to look back i charge and adjure you by every thing that is sacred and that is tremendous preserve your faith my tongue has now for the first time for several years spoken the language of my heart and the intercourse from this hour shall be shut for ever i want no pity i desire no consolation surrounded as i am with horrors i will at least preserve my fortitude to the last if i had been reserved to a different destiny i have qualities in that respect worthy of a better cause i can be mad miserable and frantic but even in frenzy i can preserve my presence of mind and discretion such was the story i had been so desirous to know though my mind had brooded upon the subject for months there was not a syllable of it that did not come to my ear with the most perfect sense of novelty mr falkland is a murderer said i as i retired from the conference this dreadful appellative a murderer made my very blood run cold within me he killed mr tyrrel for he could not control his resentment and anger he sacrificed hawkins the elder and hawkins the younger because he could upon no terms endure the public loss of honour how can i expect that a man thus passionate and unrelenting will not sooner or later make me his victim but notwithstanding this terrible application of the story an application to which perhaps in some form or other mankind are indebted for nine tenths of their abhorrence against vice i could not help occasionally recurring to reflections of an opposite nature mr falkland is a murderer resumed i he might yet be a most excellent man if he did but think so it is the thinking ourselves vicious then that principally contributes to make us vicious amidst the shock i received from finding what i had never suffered myself constantly to believe that my suspicions were true i still discovered new cause of admiration for my master his menaces indeed were terrible but when i recollected the offence i had given so contrary to every received principle of civilised society so insolent and rude so intolerable to a man of mr falklands elevation and in mr falklands peculiarity of circumstances i was astonished at his forbearance there were indeed sufficiently obvious reasons why he might not choose to proceed to extremities with me but how different from the fearful expectations i had conceived were the calmness of his behaviour and the regulated mildness of his language in this respect i for a short time imagined that i was emancipated from the mischiefs which had appalled me and that in having to do with a man of mr falklands liberality i had nothing rigorous to apprehend it is a miserable prospect said i that he holds up to me he imagines that i am restrained by no principles and deaf to the claims of personal excellence but he shall find himself mistaken i will never become an informer i will never injure my patron and therefore he will not be my enemy with all his misfortunes and all his errors i feel that my soul yearns for his welfare if he have been criminal that is owing to circumstances the same qualities under other circumstances would have been or rather were sublimely beneficent my reasonings were no doubt infinitely more favourable to mr falkland than those which human beings are accustomed to make in the case of such as they style great criminals this will not be wondered at when it is considered that i had myself just been trampling on the established boundaries of obligation and therefore might well have a fellowfeeling for other offenders add to which i had known mr falkland from the first as a beneficent divinity i had observed at leisure and with a minuteness which could not deceive me the excellent qualities of his heart and i found him possessed of a mind beyond comparison the most fertile and accomplished i had ever known but though the terrors which had impressed me were considerably alleviated my situation was notwithstanding sufficiently miserable the ease and lightheartedness of my youth were for ever gone the voice of an irresistible necessity had commanded me to sleep no more i was tormented with a secret of which i must never disburthen myself and this consciousness was at my age a source of perpetual melancholy i had made myself a prisoner in the most intolerable sense of that term for yearsâ€”perhaps for the rest of my life though my prudence and discretion should be invariable i must remember that i should have an overseer vigilant from conscious guilt full of resentment at the unjustifiable means by which i had extorted from him a confession and whose lightest caprice might at any time decide upon every thing that was dear to me the vigilance even of a public and systematical despotism is poor compared with a vigilance which is thus goaded by the most anxious passions of the soul against this species of persecution i knew not how to invent a refuge i dared neither fly from the observation of mr falkland nor continue exposed to its operation i was at first indeed lulled in a certain degree to security upon the verge of the precipice but it was not long before i found a thousand circumstances perpetually reminding me of my true situation those i am now to relate are among the most memorable  chapter vii in no long time after the disclosure mr falkland had made mr forester his elder brother by the mothers side came to reside for a short period in our family this was a circumstance peculiarly adverse to my patrons habits and inclinations he had broken off as i have already said all intercourse of visiting with his neighbours he debarred himself every kind of amusement and relaxation he shrunk from the society of his fellows and thought he could never be sufficiently buried in obscurity and solitude this principle was in most cases of no difficult execution to a man of firmness but mr falkland knew not how to avoid the visit of mr forester this gentleman was just returned from a residence of several years upon the continent and his demand of an apartment in the house of his halfbrother till his own house at the distance of thirty miles should be prepared for his reception was made with an air of confidence that scarcely admitted of a refusal mr falkland could only allege that the state of his health and spirits was such that he feared a residence at his house would be little agreeable to his kinsman and mr forester conceived that this was a disqualification which would always augment in proportion as it was tolerated and hoped that his society by inducing mr falkland to suspend his habits of seclusion would be the means of essential benefit mr falkland opposed him no further he would have been sorry to be thought unkind to a kinsman for whom he had a particular esteem and the consciousness of not daring to assign the true reason made him cautious of adhering to his objection the character of mr forester was in many respects the reverse of that of my master his very appearance indicated the singularity of his disposition his figure was short and angular his eyes were sunk far into his head and were overhung with eyebrows black thick and bushy his complexion was swarthy and his lineaments hard he had seen much of the world but to judge of him from his appearance and manners one would have thought that he had never moved from his fireside his temper was acid petulant and harsh he was easily offended by trifles respecting which previously to the offence the persons with whom he had intercourse could have no suspicion of such a result when offended his customary behaviour was exceedingly rugged he thought only of setting the delinquent right and humbling him for his error and in his eagerness to do this overlooked the sensibility of the sufferer and the pains he inflicted remonstrance in such a case he regarded as the offspring of cowardice which was to be extirpated with a steady and unshrinking hand and not soothed with misjudging kindness and indulgence as is usual in human character he had formed a system of thinking to suit the current of his feelings he held that the kindness we entertain for a man should be veiled and concealed exerted in substantial benefits but not disclosed lest an undue advantage should be taken of it by its object with this rugged outside mr forester had a warm and generous heart at first sight all men were deterred by his manner and excited to give him an ill character but the longer any one knew him the more they approved him his harshness was then only considered as habit and strong sense and active benevolence were uppermost in the recollection of his familiar acquaintance his conversation when he condescended to lay aside his snappish rude and abrupt halfsentences became flowing in diction and uncommonly amusing with regard to its substance he combined with weightiness of expression a dryness of characteristic humour that demonstrated at once the vividness of his observation and the force of his understanding the peculiarities of this gentlemans character were not undisplayed in the scene to which he was now introduced having much kindness in his disposition he soon became deeply interested in the unhappiness of his relation he did every thing in his power to remove it but his attempts were rude and unskilful with a mind so accomplished and a spirit so susceptible as that of mr falkland mr forester did not venture to let loose his usual violence of manner but if he carefully abstained from harshness he was however wholly incapable of that sweet and liquid eloquence of the soul which would perhaps have stood the fairest chance of seducing mr falkland for a moment to forget his anguish he exhorted his host to rouse up his spirit and defy the foul fiend but the tone of his exhortations found no sympathetic chord in the mind of my patron he had not the skill to carry conviction to an understanding so well fortified in error in a word after a thousand efforts of kindness to his entertainer he drew off his forces growling and dissatisfied with his own impotence rather than angry at the obstinacy of mr falkland he felt no diminution of his affection for him and was sincerely grieved to find that he was so little capable of serving him both parties in this case did justice to the merits of the other at the same time that the disparity of their humours was such as to prevent the stranger from being in any degree a dangerous companion to the master of the house they had scarcely one point of contact in their characters mr forester was incapable of giving mr falkland that degree either of pain or pleasure which can raise the soul into a tumult and deprive it for a while of tranquillity and selfcommand our visitor was a man notwithstanding appearances of a peculiarly sociable disposition and where he was neither interrupted nor contradicted considerably loquacious he began to feel himself painfully out of his element upon the present occasion mr falkland was devoted to contemplation and solitude he put upon himself some degree of restraint upon the arrival of his kinsman though even then his darling habits would break out but when they had seen each other a certain number of times and it was sufficiently evident that the society of either would be a burthen rather than a pleasure to the other they consented by a sort of silent compact that each should be at liberty to follow his own inclination mr falkland was in a sense the greatest gainer by this he returned to the habits of his choice and acted as nearly as possible just as he would have done if mr forester had not been in existence but the latter was wholly at a loss he had all the disadvantages of retirement without being able as he might have done at his house to bring his own associates or his own amusements about him in this situation he cast his eyes upon me it was his principle to do every thing that his thoughts suggested without caring for the forms of the world he saw no reason why a peasant with certain advantages of education and opportunity might not be as eligible a companion as a lord at the same time that he was deeply impressed with the venerableness of old institutions reduced as he was to a kind of last resort he found me better qualified for his purpose than any other of mr falklands household the manner in which he began this sort of correspondence was sufficiently characteristical it was abrupt but it was strongly stamped with essential benevolence it was blunt and humorous but there was attractiveness especially in a case of unequal intercourse in that very rusticity by which he levelled himself with the mass of his species he had to reconcile himself as well as to invite me not to reconcile himself to the postponing an aristocratical vanity for of that he had a very slender portion but to the trouble of invitation for he loved his ease all this produced some irregularity and indecision in his own mind and gave a whimsical impression to his behaviour on my part i was by no means ungrateful for the distinction that was paid me my mind had been relaxed into temporary dejection but my reserve had no alloy of moroseness or insensibility it did not long hold out against the condescending attentions of mr forester i became gradually heedful encouraged confiding i had a most eager thirst for the knowledge of mankind and though no person perhaps ever purchased so dearly the instructions he received in that school the inclination was in no degree diminished mr forester was the second man i had seen uncommonly worthy of my analysis and who seemed to my thoughts arrived as i was at the end of my first essay almost as much deserving to be studied as mr falkland himself i was glad to escape from the uneasiness of my reflections and while engaged with this new friend i forgot the criticalness of the evils with which i was hourly menaced stimulated by these feelings i was what mr forester wanted a diligent and zealous hearer i was strongly susceptible of impression and the alternate impressions my mind received visibly displayed themselves in my countenance and gestures the observations mr forester had made in his travels the set of opinions he had formed all amused and interested me his manner of telling a story or explaining his thoughts was forcible perspicuous and original his style in conversation had an uncommon zest every thing he had to relate delighted me while in return my sympathy my eager curiosity and my unsophisticated passions rendered me to mr forester a most desirable hearer it is not to be wondered at therefore that every day rendered our intercourse more intimate and cordial mr falkland was destined to be for ever unhappy and it seemed as if no new incident could occur from which he was not able to extract food for this imperious propensity he was wearied with a perpetual repetition of similar impressions and entertained an invincible disgust against all that was new the visit of mr forester he regarded with antipathy he was scarcely able to look at him without shuddering an emotion which his guest perceived and pitied as the result of habit and disease rather than of judgment none of his actions passed unremarked the most indifferent excited uneasiness and apprehension the first overtures of intimacy between me and mr forester probably gave birth to sentiments of jealousy in the mind of my master the irregular variable character of his visitor tended to heighten them by producing an appearance of inexplicableness and mystery at this time he intimated to me that it was not agreeable to him that there should be much intercourse between me and this gentleman what could i do young as i was could it be expected that i should play the philosopher and put a perpetual curb upon my inclinations imprudent though i had been could i voluntarily subject myself to an eternal penance and estrangement from human society could i discourage a frankness so perfectly in consonance with my wishes and receive in an ungracious way a kindness that stole away my heart besides this i was but ill prepared for the servile submission mr falkland demanded in early life i had been accustomed to be much my own master when i first entered into mr falklands service my personal habits were checked by the novelty of my situation and my affections were gained by the high accomplishments of my patron to novelty and its influence curiosity had succeeded curiosity so long as it lasted was a principle stronger in my bosom than even the love of independence to that i would have sacrificed my liberty or my life to gratify it i would have submitted to the condition of a west indian negro or to the tortures inflicted by north american savages but the turbulence of curiosity had now subsided as long as the threats of mr falkland had been confined to generals i endured it i was conscious of the unbecoming action i had committed and this rendered me humble but when he went further and undertook to prescribe to every article of my conduct my patience was at an end my mind before sufficiently sensible to the unfortunate situation to which my imprudence had reduced me now took a nearer and a more alarming view of the circumstances of the case mr falkland was not an old man he had in him the principles of vigour however they might seem to be shaken he might live as long as i should i was his prisoner and what a prisoner all my actions observed all my gestures marked i could move neither to the right nor the left but the eye of my keeper was upon me he watched me and his vigilance was a sickness to my heart for me there was no more freedom no more of hilarity of thoughtlessness or of youth was this the life upon which i had entered with such warm and sanguine expectation were my days to be wasted in this cheerless gloom a galleyslave in the hands of the system of nature whom death only the death of myself or my inexorable superior could free i had been adventurous in the gratification of an infantine and unreasonable curiosity and i resolved not to be less adventurous if need were in the defence of every thing that can make life a blessing i was prepared for an amicable adjustment of interests i would undertake that mr falkland should never sustain injury through my means but i expected in return that i should suffer no encroachment but be left to the direction of my own understanding i went on then to seek mr foresters society with eagerness and it is the nature of an intimacy that does not decline progressively to increase mr falkland observed these symptoms with visible perturbation whenever i was conscious of their being perceived by him i betrayed tokens of confusion this did not tend to allay his uneasiness one day he spoke to me alone and with a look of mysterious but terrible import expressed himself thusâ€” young man take warning perhaps this is the last time you shall have an opportunity to take it i will not always be the butt of your simplicity and inexperience nor suffer your weakness to triumph over my strength why do you trifle with me you little suspect the extent of my power at this moment you are enclosed with the snares of my vengeance unseen by you and at the instant that you flatter yourself you are already beyond their reach they will close upon you you might as well think of escaping from the power of the omnipresent god as from mine if you could touch so much as my finger you should expiate it in hours and months and years of a torment of which as yet you have not the remotest idea remember i am not talking at random i do not utter a word that if you provoke me shall not be executed to the severest letter it may be supposed that these menaces were not without their effect i withdrew in silence my whole soul revolted against the treatment i endured and yet i could not utter a word why could not i speak the expostulations of my heart or propose the compromise i meditated it was inexperience and not want of strength that awed me every act of mr falkland contained something new and i was unprepared to meet it perhaps it will be found that the greatest hero owes the propriety of his conduct to the habit of encountering difficulties and calling out with promptness the energies of his mind i contemplated the proceedings of my patron with the deepest astonishment humanity and general kindness were fundamental parts of his character but in relation to me they were sterile and inactive his own interest required that he should purchase my kindness but he preferred to govern me by terror and watch me with unceasing anxiety i ruminated with the most mournful sensations upon the nature of my calamity i believed that no human being was ever placed in a situation so pitiable as mine every atom of my frame seemed to have a several existence and to crawl within me i had but too much reason to believe that mr falklands threats were not empty words i knew his ability i felt his ascendancy if i encountered him what chance had i of victory if i were defeated what was the penalty i had to suffer well then the rest of my life must be devoted to slavish subjection miserable sentence and if it were what security had i against the injustice of a man vigilant capricious and criminal i envied the condemned wretch upon the scaffold i envied the victim of the inquisition in the midst of his torture they know what they have to suffer i had only to imagine every thing terrible and then say the fate reserved for me is worse than this it was well for me that these sensations were transient human nature could not long support itself under what i then felt by degrees my mind shook off its burthen indignation succeeded to emotions of terror the hostility of mr falkland excited hostility in me i determined i would never calumniate him in matters of the most trivial import much less betray the grand secret upon which every thing dear to him depended but totally abjuring the offensive i resolved to stand firmly upon the defensive the liberty of acting as i pleased i would preserve whatever might be the risk if i were worsted in the contest i would at least have the consolation of reflecting that i had exerted myself with energy in proportion as i thus determined i drew off my forces from petty incursions and felt the propriety of acting with premeditation and system i ruminated incessantly upon plans of deliverance but i was anxious that my choice should not be precipitately made it was during this period of my deliberation and uncertainty that mr forester terminated his visit he observed a strange distance in my behaviour and in his goodnatured rough way reproached me for it i could only answer with a gloomy look of mysterious import and a mournful and expressive silence he sought me for an explanation but i was now as ingenious in avoiding as i had before been ardent to seek him and he quitted our house as he afterwards told me with an impression that there was some ill destiny that hung over it which seemed fated to make all its inhabitants miserable without its being possible for a bystander to penetrate the reason  chapter viii mr forester had left us about three weeks when mr falkland sent me upon some business to an estate he possessed in a neighbouring county about fifty miles from his principal residence the road led in a direction wholly wide of the habitation of our late visitor i was upon my return from the place to which i had been sent when i began in fancy to take a survey of the various circumstances of my condition and by degrees lost in the profoundness of my contemplation all attention to the surrounding objects the first determination of my mind was to escape from the lynxeyed jealousy and despotism of mr falkland the second to provide by every effort of prudence and deliberation i could devise against the danger with which i well knew my attempt must be accompanied occupied with these meditations i rode many miles before i perceived that i had totally deviated from the right path at length i roused myself and surveyed the horizon round me but i could observe nothing with which my organ was previously acquainted on three sides the heath stretched as far as the eye could reach on the fourth i discovered at some distance a wood of no ordinary dimensions before me scarcely a single track could be found to mark that any human being had ever visited the spot as the best expedient i could devise i bent my course towards the wood i have mentioned and then pursued as well as i was able the windings of the inclosure this led me after some time to the end of the heath but i was still as much at a loss as ever respecting the road i should pursue the sun was hid from me by a grey and cloudy atmosphere i was induced to continue along the skirts of the wood and surmounted with some difficulty the hedges and other obstacles that from time to time presented themselves my thoughts were gloomy and disconsolate the dreariness of the day and the solitude which surrounded me seemed to communicate a sadness to my soul i had proceeded a considerable way and was overcome with hunger and fatigue when i discovered a road and a little inn at no great distance i made up to them and upon enquiry found that instead of pursuing the proper direction i had taken one that led to mr foresters rather than to my own habitation i alighted and was entering the house when the appearance of that gentleman struck my eyes mr forester accosted me with kindness invited me into the room where he had been sitting and enquired what accident had brought me to that place while he was speaking i could not help recollecting the extraordinary manner in which we were thus once more brought together and a train of ideas was by this means suggested to my mind some refreshment was by mr foresters order prepared for me i sat down and partook of it still this thought dwelt upon my recollectionâ€”mr falkland will never be made acquainted with our meeting i have an opportunity thrown in my way which if i do not improve i shall deserve all the consequences that may result i can now converse with a friend and a powerful friend without fear of being watched and overlooked what wonder that i was tempted to disclose not mr falklands secret but my own situation and receive the advice of a man of worth and experience which might perhaps be adequately done without entering into any detail injurious to my patron mr forester on his part expressed a desire to learn why it was i thought myself unhappy and why i had avoided him during the latter part of his residence under the same roof as evidently as i had before taken pleasure in his communications i replied that i could give him but an imperfect satisfaction upon these points but what i could i would willingly explain the fact i proceeded was that there were reasons which rendered it impossible for me to have a tranquil moment under the roof of mr falkland i had revolved the matter again and again in my mind and was finally convinced that i owed it to myself to withdraw from his service i added that i was sensible by this halfconfidence i might rather seem to merit the disapprobation of mr forester than his countenance but i declared my persuasion that if he could be acquainted with the whole affair however strange my behaviour might at present appear he would applaud my reserve he appeared to muse for a moment upon what i had said and then asked what reason i could have to complain of mr falkland i replied that i entertained the deepest reverence for my patron i admired his abilities and considered him as formed for the benefit of his species i should in my own opinion be the vilest of miscreants if i uttered a whisper to his disadvantage but this did not avail i was not fit for him perhaps i was not good enough for him at all events i must be perpetually miserable so long as i continued to live with him i observed mr forester gaze upon me eagerly with curiosity and surprise but this circumstance i did not think proper to notice having recovered himself he enquired why then that being the case i did not quit his service i answered what he now touched upon was that which most of all contributed to my misfortune mr falkland was not ignorant of my dislike to my present situation perhaps he thought it unreasonable unjust but i knew that he would never be brought to consent to my giving way to it here mr forester interrupted me and smiling said i magnified obstacles and overrated my own importance adding that he would undertake to remove that difficulty as well as to provide me with a more agreeable appointment this suggestion produced in me a serious alarm i replied that i must entreat him upon no account to think of applying to mr falkland upon the subject i added that perhaps i was only betraying my imbecility but in reality unacquainted as i was with experience and the world i was afraid though disgusted with my present residence to expose myself upon a mere project of my own to the resentment of so considerable a man as mr falkland if he would favour me with his advice upon the subject or if he would only give me leave to hope for his protection in case of any unforeseen accident this was all i presumed to request and thus encouraged i would venture to obey the dictates of my inclination and fly in pursuit of my lost tranquillity having thus opened myself to this generous friend as far as i could do it with propriety and safety he sat for some time silent with an air of deep reflection at length with a countenance of unusual severity and a characteristic fierceness of manner and voice he thus addressed me young man perhaps you are ignorant of the nature of the conduct you at present hold may be you do not know that where there is mystery there is always something at bottom that will not bear the telling is this the way to obtain the favour of a man of consequence and respectability to pretend to make a confidence and then tell him a disjointed story that has not common sense in it i answered that whatever were the amount of that prejudice i must submit i placed my hope of a candid construction in the present instance in the rectitude of his nature he went on you do so do you i tell you sir the rectitude of my nature is an enemy to disguise come boy you must know that i understand these things better than you tell all or expect nothing from me but censure and contempt sir replied i i have spoken from deliberation i have told you my choice and whatever be the result i must abide by it if in this misfortune you refuse me your assistance here i must end having gained by the communication only your ill opinion and displeasure he looked hard at me as if he would see me through at length he relaxed his features and softened his manner you are a foolish headstrong boy said he and i shall have an eye upon you i shall never place in you the confidence i have done butâ€”i will not desert you at present the balance between approbation and dislike is in your favour how long it will last i cannot tell i engage for nothing but it is my rule to act as i feel i will for this time do as you requireâ€”and pray god it may answer i will receive you either now or hereafter under my roof trusting that i shall have no reason to repent and that appearances will terminate as favourably as i wish though i scarcely know how to hope it we were engaged in the earnest discussion of subjects thus interesting to my peace when we were interrupted by an event the most earnestly to have been deprecated without the smallest notice and as if he had dropped upon us from the clouds mr falkland burst into the room i found afterwards that mr forester had come thus far upon an appointment to meet mr falkland and that the place of their intended rendezvous was at the next stage mr forester was detained at the inn where we now were by our accidental rencounter and in reality had for the moment forgotten his appointment while mr falkland not finding him where he expected proceeded thus far towards the house of his kinsman to me the meeting was most unaccountable in the world i instantly foresaw the dreadful complication of misfortune that was included in this event to mr falkland the meeting between me and his relation must appear not accidental but on my part at least the result of design i was totally out of the road i had been travelling by his direction i was in a road that led directly to the house of mr forester what must he think of this how must he suppose i came to that place the truth if told that i came there without design and purely in consequence of having lost my way must appear to be the most palpable lie that ever was devised here then i stood detected in the fact of that intercourse which had been so severely forbidden but in this instance it was infinitely worse than in those which had already given so much disturbance to mr falkland it was then frank and unconcealed and therefore the presumption was that it was for purposes that required no concealment but the present interview if concerted was in the most emphatical degree clandestine nor was it less perilous than it was clandestine it had been forbidden with the most dreadful menaces and mr falkland was not ignorant how deep an impression those menaces had made upon my imagination such a meeting therefore could not have been concerted under such circumstances for a trivial purpose or for any purpose that his heart did not ache to think of such was the amount of my crime such was the agony my appearance was calculated to inspire and it was reasonable to suppose that the penalty i had to expect would be proportionable the threats of mr falkland still sounded in my ears and i was in a transport of terror the conduct of the same man in different circumstances is often so various as to render it very difficult to be accounted for mr falkland in this to him terrible crisis did not seem to be in any degree hurried away by passion for a moment he was dumb his eyes glared with astonishment and the next moment as it were he had the most perfect calmness and selfcommand had it been otherwise i have no doubt that i should instantly have entered into an explanation of the manner in which i came there the ingenuousness and consistency of which could not but have been in some degree attended with a favourable event but as it was i suffered myself to be overcome i yielded as in a former instance to the discomfiting influence of surprise i dared scarcely breathe i observed the appearances with equal anxiety and surprise mr falkland quietly ordered me to return home and take along with me the groom he had brought with him i obeyed in silence i afterwards understood that he enquired minutely of mr forester the circumstances of our meeting and that that gentleman perceiving that the meeting itself was discovered and guided by habits of frankness which when once rooted in a character it is difficult to counteract told mr falkland every thing that had passed together with the remarks it had suggested to his own mind mr falkland received the communication with an ambiguous and studied silence which by no means operated to my advantage in the already poisoned mind of mr forester his silence was partly the direct consequence of a mind watchful inquisitive and doubting and partly perhaps was adopted for the sake of the effect it was calculated to produce mr falkland not being unwilling to encourage prejudices against a character which might one day come in competition with his own as to me i went home indeed for this was not a moment to resist mr falkland with a premeditation to which he had given the appearance of accident had taken care to send with me a guard to attend upon his prisoner i seemed as if conducting to one of those fortresses famed in the history of despotism from which the wretched victim is never known to come forth alive and when i entered my chamber i felt as if i were entering a dungeon i reflected that i was at the mercy of a man exasperated at my disobedience and who was already formed to cruelty by successive murders my prospects were now closed i was cut off for ever from pursuits that i had meditated with ineffable delight my death might be the event of a few hours i was a victim at the shrine of conscious guilt that knew neither rest nor satiety i should be blotted from the catalogue of the living and my fate remain eternally a secret the man who added my murder to his former crimes would show himself the next morning and be hailed with the admiration and applause of his species in the midst of these terrible imaginations one idea presented itself that alleviated my feelings this was the recollection of the strange and unaccountable tranquillity which mr falkland had manifested when he discovered me in company with mr forester i was not deceived by this i knew that the calm was temporary and would be succeeded by a tumult and whirlwind of the most dreadful sort but a man under the power of such terrors as now occupied me catches at every reed i said to myself this tranquillity is a period it is incumbent upon me to improve the shorter its duration may be found the more speedy am i obliged to be in the use of it in a word i took the resolution because i already stood in fear of the vengeance of mr falkland to risk the possibility of provoking it in a degree still more inexpiable and terminate at once my present state of uncertainty i had now opened my case to mr forester and he had given me positive assurances of his protection i determined immediately to address the following letter to mr falkland the consideration that if he meditated any thing tragical such a letter would only tend to confirm him did not enter into the present feelings of my mind sir i have conceived the intention of quitting your service this is a measure we ought both of us to desire i shall then be what it is my duty to be master of my own actions you will be delivered from the presence of a person whom you cannot prevail upon yourself to behold without unpleasing emotions why should you subject me to an eternal penance why should you consign my youthful hopes to suffering and despair consult the principles of humanity that have marked the general course of your proceedings and do not let me i entreat you be made the subject of a useless severity my heart is impressed with gratitude for your favours i sincerely ask your forgiveness for the many errors of my conduct i consider the treatment i have received under your roof as one almost uninterrupted scene of kindness and generosity i shall never forget my obligations to you and will never betray them i remain sir your most grateful respectful and dutiful servant caleb williams such was my employment of the evening of a day which will be ever memorable in the history of my life mr falkland not being yet returned though expected every hour i was induced to make use of the pretence of fatigue to avoid an interview i went to bed it may be imagined that my slumbers were neither deep nor refreshing the next morning i was informed that my patron did not come home till late that he had enquired for me and being told that i was in bed had said nothing further upon the subject satisfied in this respect i went to the breakfasting parlour and though full of anxiety and trepidation endeavoured to busy myself in arranging the books and a few other little occupations till mr falkland should come down after a short time i heard his step which i perfectly well knew how to distinguish in the passage presently he stopped and speaking to some one in a sort of deliberate but smothered voice i overheard him repeat my name as enquiring for me in conformity to the plan i had persuaded myself to adopt i now laid the letter i had written upon the table at which he usually sat and made my exit at one door as mr falkland entered at the other this done i withdrew with flutterings and palpitation to a private apartment a sort of light closet at the end of the library where i was accustomed not unfrequently to sit i had not been here three minutes when i heard the voice of mr falkland calling me i went to him in the library his manner was that of a man labouring with some dreadful thought and endeavouring to give an air of carelessness and insensibility to his behaviour perhaps no carriage of any other sort could have produced a sensation of such inexplicable horror or have excited in the person who was its object such anxious uncertainty about the eventâ€”that is your letter said he throwing it my lad continued he i believe now you have played all your tricks and the farce is nearly at an end with your apishness and absurdity however you have taught me one thing and whereas before i have winced at them with torture i am now as tough as an elephant i shall crush you in the end with the same indifference that i would any other little insect that disturbed my serenity i am unable to tell what brought about your meeting with mr forester yesterday it might be design it might be accident but i shall not forget it you write me here that you are desirous to quit my service to that i have a short answer you never shall quit it with life if you attempt it you shall never cease to rue your folly as long as you exist that is my will and i will not have it resisted the very next time you disobey me in that or any other article there is an end of your vagaries for ever perhaps your situation may be a pitiable one it is for you to look to that i only know that it is in your power to prevent its growing worse no time nor chance shall ever make it better do not imagine i am afraid of you i wear an armour against which all your weapons are impotent i have dug a pit for you and whichever way you move backward or forward to the right or the left it is ready to swallow you be still if once you fall call as loud as you will no man on earth shall hear your cries prepare a tale however plausible or however true the whole world shall execrate you for an impostor your innocence shall be of no service to you i laugh at so feeble a defence it is i that say it you may believe what i tell youâ€”do you not know miserable wretch added he suddenly altering his tone and stamping upon the ground with fury that i have sworn to preserve my reputation whatever be the expense that i love it more than the whole world and its inhabitants taken together and do you think that you shall wound it begone miscreant reptile and cease to contend with insurmountable power the part of my history which i am now relating is that which i reflect upon with the least complacency why was it that i was once more totally overcome by the imperious carriage of mr falkland and unable to utter a word the reader will be presented with many occasions in the sequel in which i wanted neither facility in the invention of expedients nor fortitude in entering upon my justification persecution at length gave firmness to my character and taught me the better part of manhood but in the present instance i was irresolute overawed and abashed the speech i had heard was the dictate of frenzy and it created in me a similar frenzy it determined me to do the very thing against which i was thus solemnly warned and fly from my patrons house i could not enter into parley with him i could no longer endure the vile subjugation he imposed on me it was in vain that my reason warned me of the rashness of a measure to be taken without concert or preparation i seemed to be in a state in which reason had no power i felt as if i could coolly survey the several arguments of the case perceive that they had prudence truth and common sense on their side and then answer i am under the guidance of a director more energetic than you i was not long in executing what i had thus rapidly determined i fixed on the evening of that very day as the period of my evasion even in this short interval i had perhaps sufficient time for deliberation but all opportunity was useless to me my mind was fixed and each succeeding moment only increased the unspeakable eagerness with which i meditated my escape the hours usually observed by our family in this country residence were regular and one in the morning was the time i selected for my undertaking in searching the apartment where i slept i had formerly discovered a concealed door which led to a small apartment of the most secret nature not uncommon in houses so old as that of mr falkland and which had perhaps served as a refuge from persecution or a security from the inveterate hostilities of a barbarous age i believed no person was acquainted with this hidingplace but myself i felt unaccountably impelled to remove into it the different articles of my personal property i could not at present take them away with me if i were never to recover them i felt that it would be a gratification to my sentiment that no trace of my existence should be found after my departure having completed their removal and waited till the hour i had previously chosen i stole down quietly from my chamber with a lamp in my hand i went along a passage that led to a small door opening into the garden and then crossed the garden to a gate that intersected an elmwalk and a private horsepath on the outside i could scarcely believe my good fortune in having thus far executed my design without interruption the terrible images mr falklands menaces had suggested to my mind made me expect impediment and detection at every step though the impassioned state of my mind impelled me to advance with desperate resolution he probably however counted too securely upon the ascendancy of his sentiments when imperiously pronounced to think it necessary to take precautions against a sinister event for myself i drew a favourable omen as to the final result of my project from the smoothness of success that attended it in the outset  chapter ix the first plan that had suggested itself to me was to go to the nearest public road and take the earliest stage for london there i believed i should be most safe from discovery if the vengeance of mr falkland should prompt him to pursue me and i did not doubt among the multiplied resources of the metropolis to find something which should suggest to me an eligible mode of disposing of my person and industry i reserved mr forester in my arrangement as a last resource not to be called forth unless for immediate protection from the hand of persecution and power i was destitute of that experience of the world which can alone render us fertile in resources or enable us to institute a just comparison between the resources that offer themselves i was like the fascinated animal that is seized with the most terrible apprehensions at the same time that he is incapable of adequately considering for his own safety the mode of my proceeding being digested i traced with a cheerful heart the unfrequented path it was now necessary for me to pursue the night was gloomy and it drizzled with rain but these were circumstances i had scarcely the power to perceive all was sunshine and joy within me i hardly felt the ground i repeated to myself a thousand times i am free what concern have i with danger and alarm i feel that i am free i feel that i will continue so what power is able to hold in chains a mind ardent and determined what power can cause that man to die whose whole soul commands him to continue to live i looked back with abhorrence to the subjection in which i had been held i did not hate the author of my misfortunesâ€”truth and justice acquit me of that i rather pitied the hard destiny to which he seemed condemned but i thought with unspeakable loathing of those errors in consequence of which every man is fated to be more or less the tyrant or the slave i was astonished at the folly of my species that they did not rise up as one man and shake off chains so ignominious and misery so insupportable so far as related to myself i resolvedâ€”and this resolution has never been entirely forgotten by meâ€”to hold myself disengaged from this odious scene and never fill the part either of the oppressor or the sufferer my mind continued in this enthusiastical state full of confidence and accessible only to such a portion of fear as served rather to keep up a state of pleasurable emotion than to generate anguish and distress during the whole of this nocturnal expedition after a walk of three hours i arrived without accident at the village from which i hoped to have taken my passage for the metropolis at this early hour every thing was quiet no sound of any thing human saluted my ear it was with difficulty that i gained admittance into the yard of the inn where i found a single ostler taking care of some horses from him i received the unwelcome tidings that the coach was not expected till six oclock in the morning of the day after tomorrow its route through that town recurring only three times a week this intelligence gave the first check to the rapturous inebriation by which my mind had been possessed from the moment i quitted the habitation of mr falkland the whole of my fortune in ready cash consisted of about eleven guineas i had about fifty more that had fallen to me from the disposal of my property at the death of my father but that was so vested as to preclude it from immediate use and i even doubted whether it would not be found better ultimately to resign it than by claiming it to risk the furnishing a clew to what i most of all dreaded the persecution of mr falkland there was nothing i so ardently desired as the annihilation of all future intercourse between us that he should not know there was such a person on the earth as myself and that i should never more hear the repetition of a name which had been so fatal to my peace thus circumstanced i conceived frugality to be an object by no means unworthy of my attention unable as i was to prognosticate what discouragements and delays might present themselves to the accomplishment of my wishes after my arrival in london for this and other reasons i determined to adhere to my design of travelling by the stage it only remaining for me to consider in what manner i should prevent the eventful delay of twentyfour hours from becoming by any untoward event a source of new calamity it was by no means advisable to remain in the village where i now was during this interval nor did i even think proper to employ it in proceeding on foot along the great road i therefore decided upon making a circuit the direction of which should seem at first extremely wide of my intended route and then suddenly taking a different inclination should enable me to arrive by the close of day at a markettown twelve miles nearer to the metropolis having fixed the economy of the day and persuaded myself that it was the best which under the circumstances could be adopted i dismissed for the most part all further anxieties from my mind and eagerly yielded myself up to the different amusements that arose i rested and went forward at the impulse of the moment at one time i reclined upon a bank immersed in contemplation and at another exerted myself to analyse the prospects which succeeded each other the haziness of the morning was followed by a spiritstirring and beautiful day with the ductility so characteristic of a youthful mind i forgot the anguish which had lately been my continual guest and occupied myself entirely in dreams of future novelty and felicity i scarcely ever in the whole course of my existence spent a day of more various or exquisite gratification it furnished a strong and perhaps not an unsalutary contrast to the terrors which had preceded and the dreadful scenes that awaited me in the evening i arrived at the place of my destination and enquired for the inn at which the coach was accustomed to call a circumstance however had previously excited my attention and reproduced in me a state of alarm though it was already dark before i reached the town my observation had been attracted by a man who passed me on horseback in the opposite direction about half a mile on the other side of the town there was an inquisitiveness in his gesture that i did not like and as far as i could discern his figure i pronounced him an illlooking man he had not passed me more than two minutes before i heard the sound of a horse advancing slowly behind me these circumstances impressed some degree of uneasy sensation upon my mind i first mended my pace and this not appearing to answer the purpose i afterwards loitered that the horseman might pass me he did so and as i glanced at him i thought i saw that it was the same man he now put his horse into a trot and entered the town i followed and it was not long before i perceived him at the door of an alehouse drinking a mug of beer this however the darkness prevented me from discovering till i was in a manner upon him i pushed forward and saw him no more till as i entered the yard of the inn where i intended to sleep the same man suddenly rode up to me and asked if my name were williams this adventure while it had been passing expelled the gaiety of my mind and filled me with anxiety the apprehension however that i felt appeared to me groundless if i were pursued i took it for granted it would be by some of mr falklands people and not by a stranger the darkness took from me some of the simplest expedients of precaution i determined at least to proceed to the inn and make the necessary enquiries i no sooner heard the sound of the horse as i entered the yard and the question proposed to me by the rider than the dreadful certainty of what i feared instantly took possession of my mind every incident connected with my late abhorred situation was calculated to impress me with the deepest alarm my first thought was to betake myself to the fields and trust to the swiftness of my flight for safety but this was scarcely practicable i remarked that my enemy was alone and i believed that man to man i might reasonably hope to get the better of him either by the firmness of my determination or the subtlety of my invention thus resolved i replied in an impetuous and peremptory tone that i was the man he took me for adding i guess your errand but it is to no purpose you come to conduct me back to falkland house but no force shall ever drag me to that place alive i have not taken my resolution without strong reasons and all the world shall not persuade me to alter it i am an englishman and it is the privilege of an englishman to be sole judge and master of his own actions you are in the devil of a hurry replied the man to guess my intentions and tell your own but your guess is right and mayhap you may have reason to be thankful that my errand is not something worse sure enough the squire expects youâ€”but i have a letter and when you have read that i suppose you will come off a little of your stoutness if that does not answer it will then be time to think what is to be done next thus saying he gave me his letter which was from mr forester whom as he told me he had left at mr falklands house i went into a room of the inn for the purpose of reading it and was followed by the bearer the letter was as followsâ€” williams my brother falkland has sent the bearer in pursuit of you he expects that if found you will return with him i expect it too it is of the utmost consequence to your future honour and character after reading these lines if you are a villain and a rascal you will perhaps endeavour to fly if your conscience tells you you are innocent you will out of all doubt come back show me then whether i have been your dupe and while i was won over by your seeming ingenuousness have suffered myself to be made the tool of a designing knave if you come i pledge myself that if you clear your reputation you shall not only be free to go wherever you please but shall receive every assistance in my power to give remember i engage for nothing further than that valentine forester what a letter was this to a mind like mine glowing with the love of virtue such an address was strong enough to draw the person to whom it was addressed from one end of the earth to the other my mind was full of confidence and energy i felt my own innocence and was determined to assert it i was willing to be driven out a fugitive i even rejoiced in my escape and cheerfully went out into the world destitute of every provision and depending for my future prospects upon my own ingenuity thus much said i falkland you may do dispose of me as you please with respect to the goods of fortune but you shall neither make prize of my liberty nor sully the whiteness of my name i repassed in my thoughts every memorable incident that had happened to me under his roof i could recollect nothing except the affair of the mysterious trunk out of which the shadow of a criminal accusation could be extorted in that instance my conduct had been highly reprehensible and i had never looked back upon it without remorse and selfcondemnation but i did not believe that it was of the nature of those actions which can be brought under legal censure i could still less persuade myself that mr falkland who shuddered at the very possibility of detection and who considered himself as completely in my power would dare to bring forward a subject so closely connected with the internal agony of his soul in a word the more i reflected on the phrases of mr foresters billet the less could i imagine the nature of those scenes to which they were to serve as a prelude the inscrutableness however of the mystery they contained did not suffice to overwhelm my courage my mind seemed to undergo an entire revolution timid and embarrassed as i had felt myself when i regarded mr falkland as my clandestine and domestic foe i now conceived that the case was entirely altered meet me said i as an open accuser if we must contend let us contend in the face of day and then unparalleled as your resources may be i will not fear you innocence and guilt were in my apprehension the things in the whole world the most opposite to each other i would not suffer myself to believe that the former could be confounded with the latter unless the innocent man first allowed himself to be subdued in mind before he was defrauded of the good opinion of mankind virtue rising superior to every calamity defeating by a plain unvarnished tale all the stratagems of vice and throwing back upon her adversary the confusion with which he had hoped to overwhelm her was one of the favourite subjects of my youthful reveries i determined never to prove an instrument of destruction to mr falkland but i was not less resolute to obtain justice to myself the issue of all these confident hopes i shall immediately have occasion to relate it was thus with the most generous and undoubting spirit that i rushed upon irretrievable ruin friend said i to the bearer after a considerable interval of silence you are right this is indeed an extraordinary letter you have brought me but it answers its purpose i will certainly go with you now whatever be the consequence no person shall ever impute blame to me so long as i have it in my power to clear myself i felt in the circumstances in which i was placed by mr foresters letter not merely a willingness but an alacrity and impatience to return we procured a second horse we proceeded on our journey in silence my mind was occupied again in endeavouring to account for mr foresters letter i knew the inflexibility and sternness of mr falklands mind in accomplishing the purposes he had at heart but i also knew that every virtuous and magnanimous principle was congenial to his character when we arrived midnight was already past and we were obliged to waken one of the servants to give us admittance i found that mr forester had left a message for me in consideration of the possibility of my arrival during the night directing me immediately to go to bed and to take care that i did not come weary and exhausted to the business of the following day i endeavoured to take his advice but my slumbers were unrefreshing and disturbed i suffered however no reduction of courage the singularity of my situation my conjectures with respect to the present my eagerness for the future did not allow me to sink into a languid and inactive state next morning the first person i saw was mr forester he told me that he did not yet know what mr falkland had to allege against me for that he had refused to know he had arrived at the house of his brother by appointment on the preceding day to settle some indispensable business his intention having been to depart the moment the business was finished as he knew that conduct on his part would be most agreeable to mr falkland but he was no sooner come than he found the whole house in confusion the alarm of my elopement having been given a few hours before mr falkland had despatched servants in all directions in pursuit of me and the servant from the markettown arrived at the same moment with mr forester with intelligence that a person answering the description he gave had been there very early in the morning enquiring respecting the stage to london mr falkland seemed extremely disturbed at this information and exclaimed on me with acrimony as an unthankful and unnatural villain mr forester replied have more command of yourself sir villain is a serious appellation and must not be trifled with englishmen are free and no man is to be charged with villainy because he changes one source of subsistence for another mr falkland shook his head and with a smile expressive of acute sensibility said brother brother you are the dupe of his art i always considered him with an eye of suspicion and was aware of his depravity but i have just discoveredâ€” stop sir interrupted mr forester i own i thought that in a moment of acrimony you might be employing harsh epithets in a sort of random style but if you have a serious accusation to state we must not be told of that till it is known whether the lad is within reach of a hearing i am indifferent myself about the good opinion of others it is what the world bestows and retracts with so little thought that i can make no account of its decision but that does not authorise me lightly to entertain an ill opinion of another the slenderest allowance i think i can make to such as i consign to be the example and terror of their species is that of being heard in their own defence it is a wise principle that requires the judge to come into court uninformed of the merits of the cause he is to try and to that principle i am determined to conform as an individual i shall always think it right to be severe and inflexible in my treatment of offenders but the severity i exercise in the sequel must be accompanied with impartiality and caution in what is preliminary while mr forester related to me these particulars he observed me ready to break out into some of the expressions which the narrative suggested but he would not suffer me to speak no said he i would not hear mr falkland against you and i cannot hear you in your defence i come to you at present to speak and not to hear i thought it right to warn you of your danger but i have nothing more to do now reserve what you have to say to the proper time make the best story you can for yourselfâ€”true if truth as i hope will serve your purpose but if not the most plausible and ingenious you can invent that is what selfdefence requires from every man where as it always happens to a man upon his trial he has the whole world against him and has his own battle to fight against the world farewell and god send you a good deliverance if mr falklands accusation whatever it be shall appear premature depend upon having me more zealously your friend than ever if not this is the last act of friendship you will ever receive from me it may be believed that this address so singular so solemn so big with conditional menace did not greatly tend to encourage me i was totally ignorant of the charge to be advanced against me and not a little astonished when it was in my power to be in the most formidable degree the accuser of mr falkland to find the principles of equity so completely reversed as for the innocent but instructed individual to be the party accused and suffering instead of having as was natural the real criminal at his mercy i was still more astonished at the superhuman power mr falkland seemed to possess of bringing the object of his persecution within the sphere of his authority a reflection attended with some check to that eagerness and boldness of spirit which now constituted the ruling passion of my mind but this was no time for meditation to the sufferer the course of events is taken out of his direction and he is hurried along with an irresistible force without finding it within the compass of his efforts to check their rapidity i was allowed only a short time to recollect myself when my trial commenced i was conducted to the library where i had passed so many happy and so many contemplative hours and found there mr forester and three or four of the servants already assembled in expectation of me and my accuser every thing was calculated to suggest to me that i must trust only in the justice of the parties concerned and had nothing to hope from their indulgence mr falkland entered at one door almost as soon as i entered at the other  chapter x he began it has been the principle of my life never to inflict a wilful injury upon any thing that lives i need not express my regret when i find myself obliged to be the promulgator of a criminal charge how gladly would i pass unnoticed the evil i have sustained but i owe it to society to detect an offender and prevent other men from being imposed upon as i have been by an appearance of integrity it would be better interrupted mr forester to speak directly to the point we ought not though unwarily by apologising for ourselves to create at such a time a prejudice against an individual against whom a criminal accusation will always be prejudice enough i strongly suspect continued mr falkland this young man who has been peculiarly the object of my kindness of having robbed me to a considerable amount what replied mr forester are the grounds of your suspicion the first of them is the actual loss i have sustained in notes jewels and plate i have missed banknotes to the amount of nine hundred pounds three gold repeaters of considerable value a complete set of diamonds the property of my late mother and several other articles and why continued my arbitrator astonishment grief and a desire to retain his selfpossession strong contending in his countenance and voice do you fix on this young man as the instrument of the depredation i found him on my coming home upon the day when every thing was in disorder from the alarm of fire in the very act of quitting the private apartment where these articles were deposited he was confounded at seeing me and hastened to withdraw as soon as he possibly could did you say nothing to himâ€”take no notice of the confusion your sudden appearance produced i asked what was his errand in that place he was at first so terrified and overcome that he could not answer me afterwards with a good deal of faltering he said that when all the servants were engaged in endeavouring to save the most valuable part of my property he had come hither with the same view but that he had as yet removed nothing did you immediately examine to see that every thing was safe no i was accustomed to confide in his honesty and i was suddenly called away in the present instance to attend to the increasing progress of the flames i therefore only took out the key from the door of the apartment having first locked it and putting it in my pocket hastened to go where my presence seemed indispensably necessary how long was it before you missed your property the same evening the hurry of the scene had driven the circumstance entirely out of my mind till going by accident near the apartment the whole affair together with the singular and equivocal behaviour of williams rushed at once upon my recollection i immediately entered examined the trunk in which these things were contained and to my astonishment found the locks broken and the property gone what steps did you take upon this discovery i sent for williams and talked to him very seriously upon the subject but he had now perfectly recovered his selfcommand and calmly and stoutly denied all knowledge of the matter i urged him with the enormousness of the offence but i made no impression he did not discover either the surprise and indignation one would have expected from a person entirely innocent or the uneasiness that generally attends upon guilt he was rather silent and reserved i then informed him that i should proceed in a manner different from what he might perhaps expect i would not as is too frequent in such cases make a general search for i had rather lose my property for ever without redress than expose a multitude of innocent persons to anxiety and injustice my suspicion for the present unavoidably fixed upon him but in a matter of so great consequence i was determined not to act upon suspicion i would neither incur the possibility of ruining him being innocent nor be the instrument of exposing others to his depredations if guilty i should therefore merely insist upon his continuing in my service he might depend upon it he should be well watched and i trusted the whole truth would eventually appear since he avoided confession now i advised him to consider how far it was likely he would come off with impunity at last this i determined on that the moment he attempted an escape i would consider that as an indication of guilt and proceed accordingly what circumstances have occurred from that time to the present none upon which i can infer a certainty of guilt several that agree to favour a suspicion from that time williams was perpetually uneasy in his situation always desirous as it now appears to escape but afraid to adopt such a measure without certain precautions it was not long after that you mr forester became my visitor i observed with dissatisfaction the growing intercourse between you reflecting on the equivocalness of his character and the attempt he would probably make to render you the dupe of his hypocrisy i accordingly threatened him severely and i believe you observed the change that presently after occurred in his behaviour with relation to you i did and it appeared at that time mysterious and extraordinary some time after as you well know a rencounter took place between you whether accidental or intentional on his part i am not able to say when he confessed to you the uneasiness of his mind without discovering the cause and openly proposed to you to assist him in his flight and stand in case of necessity between him and my resentment you offered it seems to take him into your service but nothing as he acknowledged would answer his purpose that did not place his retreat wholly out of my power to discover did it not appear extraordinary to you that he should hope for any effectual protection from me while it remained perpetually in your power to satisfy me of his unworthiness perhaps he had hopes that i should not proceed to that step at least so long as the place of his retreat should be unknown to me and of consequence the event of my proceeding dubious perhaps he confided in his own powers which are far from contemptible to construct a plausible tale especially as he had taken care to have the first impression in his favour after all this protection on your part was merely reserved in case all other expedients failed he does not appear to have had any other sentiment upon the subject than that if he were defeated in his projects for placing himself beyond the reach of justice it was better to have bespoken a place in your patronage than to be destitute of every resource mr falkland having thus finished his evidence called upon robert the valet to confirm the part of it which related to the day of the fire robert stated that he happened to be coming through the library that day a few minutes after mr falklands being brought home by the sight of the fire that he had found me standing there with every mark of perturbation and fright that he could not help stopping to notice it that he had spoken to me two or three times before he could obtain an answer and that all he could get from me at last was that i was the most miserable creature alive he further said that in the evening of the same day mr falkland called him into the private apartment adjoining to the library and bid him bring a hammer and some nails he then showed him a trunk standing in the apartment with its locks and fastening broken and ordered him to observe and remember what he saw but not to mention it to any one robert did not at that time know what mr falkland intended by these directions which were given in a manner uncommonly solemn and significant but he entertained no doubt that the fastenings were broken and wrenched by the application of a chisel or suchlike instrument with the intention of forcibly opening the trunk mr forester observed upon this evidence that as much of it as related to the day of the fire seemed indeed to afford powerful reasons for suspicion and that the circumstances that had occurred since strangely concurred to fortify that suspicion meantime that nothing proper to be done might be omitted he asked whether in my flight i had removed my boxes to see whether by that means any trace could be discovered to confirm the imputation mr falkland treated this suggestion slightly saying that if i were the thief i had no doubt taken the precaution to obviate so palpable a means of detection to this mr forester only replied that conjecture however skilfully formed was not always realised in the actions and behaviour of mankind and ordered that my boxes and trunks if found should be brought into the library i listened to this suggestion with pleasure and uneasy and confounded as i was at the appearances combined against me i trusted in this appeal to give a new face to my cause i was eager to declare the place where my property was deposited and the servants guided by my direction presently produced what was enquired for the two boxes that were first opened contained nothing to confirm the accusation against me in the third were found a watch and several jewels that were immediately known to be the property of mr falkland the production of this seemingly decisive evidence excited emotions of astonishment and concern but no persons astonishment appeared to be greater than that of mr falkland that i should have left the stolen goods behind me would of itself have appeared incredible but when it was considered what a secure place of concealment i had found for them the wonder diminished and mr forester observed that it was by no means impossible i might conceive it easier to obtain possession of them afterwards than to remove them at the period of my precipitate flight here however i thought it necessary to interfere i fervently urged my right to a fair and impartial construction i asked mr forester whether it were probable if i had stolen these things that i should not have contrived at least to remove them along with me and again whether if i had been conscious they would he found among my property i should myself have indicated the place where i had concealed it the insinuation i conveyed against mr foresters impartiality overspread his whole countenance for an instant with the flush of anger impartiality young man yes be sure from me you shall experience an impartial treatment god send that may answer your purpose presently you shall be heard at full in your own defence you expect us to believe you innocent because you did not remove these things along with you the money is removed where sir is that we cannot answer for the inconsistences and oversights of any human mind and least of all if that mind should appear to be disturbed with the consciousness of guilt you observe that it was by your own direction these boxes and trunks have been found that is indeed extraordinary it appears little less than infatuation but to what purpose appeal to probabilities and conjecture in the face of incontestable facts there sir are the boxes you alone knew where they were to be found you alone had the keys tell us then how this watch and these jewels came to be contained in them i was silent to the rest of the persons present i seemed to be merely the subject of detection but in reality i was of all the spectators that individual who was most at a loss to conceive through every stage of the scene what would come next and who listened to every word that was uttered with the most uncontrollable amazement amazement however alternately yielded to indignation and horror at first i could not refrain from repeatedly attempting to interrupt but i was checked in these attempts by mr forester and i presently felt how necessary it was to my future peace that i should collect the whole energy of my mind to repel the charge and assert my innocence every thing being now produced that could be produced against me mr forester turned to me with a look of concern and pity and told me that now was the time if i chose to allege any thing in my defence in reply to this invitation i spoke nearly as followsâ€” i am innocent it is in vain that circumstances are accumulated against me there is not a person upon earth less capable than i of the things of which i am accused i appeal to my heartâ€”i appeal to my looksâ€”i appeal to every sentiment my tongue ever uttered i could perceive that the fervour with which i spoke made some impression upon every one that heard me but in a moment their eyes were turned upon the property that lay before them and their countenances changed i proceededâ€” one thing more i must averâ€”mr falkland is not deceived he perfectly knows that i am innocent i had no sooner uttered these words than an involuntary cry of indignation burst from every person in the room mr forester turned to me with a look of extreme severity and saidâ€” young man consider well what you are doing it is the privilege of the party accused to say whatever he thinks proper and i will take care that you shall enjoy that privilege in its utmost extent but do you think it will conduce in any respect to your benefit to throw out such insolent and intolerable insinuations i thank you most sincerely replied i for your caution but i well know what it is i am doing i make this declaration not merely because it is solemnly true but because it is inseparably connected with my vindication i am the party accused and i shall be told that i am not to be believed in my own defence i can produce no other witnesses of my innocence i therefore call upon mr falkland to be my evidence i ask himâ€” did you never boast to me in private of your power to ruin me did you never say that if once i brought on myself the weight of your displeasure my fall should be irreparable did you not tell me that though i should prepare in that case a tale however plausible or however true you would take care that the whole world should execrate me as an impostor were not those your very words did you not add that my innocence should be of no service to me and that you laughed at so feeble a defence i ask you furtherâ€”did you not receive a letter from me the morning of the day on which i departed requesting your consent to my departure should i have done that if my flight had been that of a thief i challenge any man to reconcile the expressions of that letter with this accusation should i have begun with stating that i had conceived a desire to quit your service if my desire and the reasons for it had been of the nature that is now alleged should i have dared to ask for what reason i was thus subjected to an eternal penance saying this i took out a copy of my letter and laid it open upon the table mr falkland returned no immediate answer to my interrogations mr forester turned to him and said well sir what is your reply to this challenge of your servant mr falkland answered such a mode of defence scarcely calls for a reply but i answer i held no such conversation i never used such words i received no such letter surely it is no sufficient refutation of a criminal charge that the criminal repels what is alleged against him with volubility of speech and intrepidity of manner mr forester then turned to me if said he you trust your vindication to the plausibility of your tale you must take care to render it consistent and complete you have not told us what was the cause of the confusion and anxiety in which robert professes to have found you why you were so impatient to quit the service of mr falkland or how you account for certain articles of his property being found in your possession all that sir answered i is true there are certain parts of my story that i have not told if they were told they would not conduce to my disadvantage and they would make the present accusation appear still more astonishing but i cannot as yet at least prevail upon myself to tell them is it necessary to give any particular and precise reasons why i should wish to change the place of my residence you all of you know the unfortunate state of mr falklands mind you know the sternness reservedness and distance of his manners if i had no other reasons surely it would afford small presumption of criminality that i should wish to change his service for another the question of how these articles of mr falklands property came to be found in my possession is more material it is a question i am wholly unable to answer their being found there was at least as unexpected to me as to any one of the persons now present i only know that as i have the most perfect assurance of mr falklands being conscious of my innocenceâ€”for observe i do not shrink from that assertion i reiterate it with new confidenceâ€”i therefore firmly and from my soul believe that their being there is of mr falklands contrivance i no sooner said this than i was again interrupted by an involuntary exclamation from every one present they looked at me with furious glances as if they could have torn me to pieces i proceededâ€” i have now answered every thing that is alleged against me mr forester you are a lover of justice i conjure you not to violate it in my person you are a man of penetration look at me do you see any of the marks of guilt recollect all that has ever passed under your observation is it compatible with a mind capable of what is now alleged against me could a real criminal have shown himself so unabashed composed and firm as i have now done fellowservants mr falkland is a man of rank and fortune he is your master i am a poor country lad without a friend in the world that is a ground of real difference to a certain extent but it is not a sufficient ground for the subversion of justice remember that i am in a situation that is not to be trifled with that a decision given against me now in a case in which i solemnly assure you i am innocent will for ever deprive me of reputation and peace of mind combine the whole world in a league against me and determine perhaps upon my liberty and my life if you believeâ€”if you seeâ€”if you know that i am innocent speak for me do not suffer a pusillanimous timidity to prevent you from saving a fellowcreature from destruction who does not deserve to have a human being for his enemy why have we the power of speech but to communicate our thoughts i will never believe that a man conscious of innocence cannot make other men perceive that he has that thought do not you feel that my whole heart tells me i am not guilty of what is imputed to me to you mr falkland i have nothing to say i know you and know that you are impenetrable at the very moment that you are urging such odious charges against me you admire my resolution and forbearance but i have nothing to hope from you you can look upon my ruin without pity or remorse i am most unfortunate indeed in having to do with such an adversary you oblige me to say ill things of you but i appeal to your own heart whether my language is that of exaggeration or revenge every thing that could be alleged on either side being now concluded mr forester undertook to make some remarks upon the whole williams said he the charge against you is heavy the direct evidence strong the corroborating circumstances numerous and striking i grant that you have shown considerable dexterity in your answers but you will learn young man to your cost that dexterity however powerful it may be in certain cases will avail little against the stubbornness of truth it is fortunate for mankind that the empire of talents has its limitations and that it is not in the power of ingenuity to subvert the distinctions of right and wrong take my word for it that the true merits of the case against you will be too strong for sophistry to overturn that justice will prevail and impotent malice be defeated to you mr falkland society is obliged for having placed this black affair in its true light do not suffer the malignant aspersions of the criminal to give you uneasiness depend upon it that they will be found of no weight i have no doubt that your character in the judgment of every person that has heard them stands higher than ever we feel for your misfortune in being obliged to hear such calumnies from a person who has injured you so grossly but you must be considered in that respect as a martyr in the public cause the purity of your motives and dispositions is beyond the reach of malice and truth and equity will not fail to award to your calumniator infamy and to you the love and approbation of mankind i have now told you williams what i think of your case but i have no right to assume to be your ultimate judge desperate as it appears to me i will give you one piece of advice as if i were retained as a counsel to assist you leave out of it whatever tends to the disadvantage of mr falkland defend yourself as well as you can but do not attack your master it is your business to create in those who hear you a prepossession in your favour but the recrimination you have been now practising will always create indignation dishonesty will admit of some palliation the deliberate malice you have now been showing is a thousand times more atrocious it proves you to have the mind of a demon rather than of a felon wherever you shall repeat it those who hear you will pronounce you guilty upon that even if the proper evidence against you were glaringly defective if therefore you would consult your interest which seems to be your only consideration it is incumbent upon you by all means immediately to retract that if you desire to be believed honest you must in the first place show that you have a due sense of merit in others you cannot better serve your cause than by begging pardon of your master and doing homage to rectitude and worth even when they are employed in vengeance against you it is easy to conceive that my mind sustained an extreme shock from the decision of mr forester but his call upon me to retract and humble myself before my accuser penetrated my whole soul with indignation i answeredâ€” i have already told you i am innocent i believe that i could not endure the effort of inventing a plausible defence if it were otherwise you have just affirmed that it is not in the power of ingenuity to subvert the distinctions of right and wrong and in that very instant i find them subverted this is indeed to me a very awful moment new to the world i know nothing of its affairs but what has reached me by rumour or is recorded in books i have come into it with all the ardour and confidence inseparable from my years in every fellowbeing i expected to find a friend i am unpractised in its wiles and have even no acquaintance with its injustice i have done nothing to deserve the animosity of mankind but if i may judge from the present scene i am henceforth to be deprived of the benefits of integrity and honour i am to forfeit the friendship of every one i have hitherto known and to be precluded from the power of acquiring that of others i must therefore be reduced to derive my satisfaction from myself depend upon it i will not begin that career by dishonourable concessions if i am to despair of the goodwill of other men i will at least maintain the independence of my own mind mr falkland is my implacable enemy whatever may be his merits in other respects he is acting towards me without humanity without remorse and without principle do you think i will ever make submissions to a man by whom i am thus treated that i will fall down at the feet of one who is to me a devil or kiss the hand that is red with my blood in that respect answered mr forester do as you shall think proper i must confess that your firmness and consistency astonish me they add something to what i had conceived of human powers perhaps you have chosen the part which all things considered may serve your purpose best though i think more moderation would be more conciliating the exterior of innocence will i grant stagger the persons who may have the direction of your fate but it will never be able to prevail against plain and incontrovertible facts but i have done with you i see in you a new instance of that abuse which is so generally made of talents the admiration of an undiscerning public i regard you with horror all that remains is that i should discharge my duty in consigning you as a monster of depravity to the justice of your country no rejoined mr falkland to that i can never consent i have put a restraint upon myself thus far because it was right that evidence and enquiry should take their course i have suppressed all my habits and sentiments because it seemed due to the public that hypocrisy should be unmasked but i can suffer this violence no longer i have through my whole life interfered to protect not overbear the sufferer and i must do so now i feel not the smallest resentment of his impotent attacks upon my character i smile at their malice and they make no diminution in my benevolence to their author let him say what he pleases he cannot hurt me it was proper that he should be brought to public shame that other people might not be deceived by him as we have been but there is no necessity for proceeding further and i must insist upon it that he be permitted to depart wherever he pleases i am sorry that public interest affords so gloomy a prospect for his future happiness mr falkland answered mr forester these sentiments do honour to your humanity but i must not give way to them they only serve to set in a stronger light the venom of this serpent this monster of ingratitude who first robs his benefactor and then reviles him wretch that you are will nothing move you are you inaccessible to remorse are you not struck to the heart with the unmerited goodness of your master vile calumniator you are the abhorrence of nature the opprobrium of the human species and the earth can only be freed from an insupportable burthen by your being exterminated recollect sir that this monster at the very moment that you are exercising such unexampled forbearance in his behalf has the presumption to charge you with prosecuting a crime of which you know him to be innocent nay with having conveyed the pretended stolen goods among his property for the express purpose of ruining him by this unexampled villainy he makes it your duty to free the world from such a pest and your interest to admit no relaxing in your pursuit of him lest the world should be persuaded by your clemency to credit his vile insinuations i care not for the consequences replied mr falkland i will obey the dictates of my own mind i will never lend my assistance to the reforming mankind by axes and gibbets i am sure things will never be as they ought till honour and not law be the dictator of mankind till vice be taught to shrink before the resistless might of inborn dignity and not before the cold formality of statutes if my calumniator were worthy of my resentment i would chastise him with my own sword and not that of the magistrate but in the present case i smile at his malice and resolve to spare him as the generous lord of the forest spares the insect that would disturb his repose the language you now hold said mr forester is that of romance and not of reason yet i cannot but be struck with the contrast exhibited before me of the magnanimity of virtue and the obstinate impenetrable injustice of guilt while your mind overflows with goodness nothing can touch the heart of this thricerefined villain i shall never forgive myself for having once been entrapped by his detestable arts this is no time for us to settle the question between chivalry and law i shall therefore simply insist as a magistrate having taken the evidence in this felony upon my right and duty of following the course of justice and committing the accused to the county jail after some further contest mr falkland finding mr forester obstinate and impracticable withdrew his opposition accordingly a proper officer was summoned from the neighbouring village a mittimus made out and one of mr falklands carriages prepared to conduct me to the place of custody it will easily be imagined that this sudden reverse was very painfully felt by me i looked round on the servants who had been the spectators of my examination but not one of them either by word or gesture expressed compassion for my calamity the robbery of which i was accused appeared to them atrocious from its magnitude and whatever sparks of compassion might otherwise have sprung up in their ingenuous and undisciplined minds were totally obliterated by indignation at my supposed profligacy in recriminating upon their worthy and excellent master my fate being already determined and one of the servants despatched for the officer mr forester and mr falkland withdrew and left me in the custody of two others one of these was the son of a farmer at no great distance who had been in habits of longestablished intimacy with my late father i was willing accurately to discover the state of mind of those who had been witnesses of this scene and who had had some previous opportunity of observing my character and manners i therefore endeavoured to open a conversation with him well my good thomas said i in a querulous tone and with a hesitating manner am i not a most miserable creature do not speak to me master williams you have given me a shock that i shall not get the better of for one while you were hatched by a hen as the saying is but you came of the spawn of a cockatrice i am glad to my heart that honest farmer williams is dead your villainy would else have made him curse the day that ever he was born thomas i am innocent i swear by the great god that shall judge me another day i am innocent pray do not swear for goodness sake do not swear your poor soul is damned enough without that for your sake lad i will never take any bodys word nor trust to appearances tho it should be an angel lord bless us how smoothly you palavered it over for all the world as if you had been as fair as a newborn babe but it will not do you will never be able to persuade people that black is white for my own part i have done with you i loved you yesterday all one as if you had been my own brother today i love you so well that i would go ten miles with all the pleasure in life to see you hanged good god thomas have you the heart what a change i call god to witness i have done nothing to deserve it what a world do we live in hold your tongue boy it makes my very heart sick to hear you i would not lie a night under the same roof with you for all the world i should expect the house to fall and crush such wickedness i admire that the earth does not open and swallow you alive it is poison so much as to look at you if you go on at this hardened rate i believe from my soul that the people you talk to will tear you to pieces and you will never live to come to the gallows oh yes you do well to pity yourself poor tender thing that spit venom all round you like a toad and leave the very ground upon which you crawl infected with your slime finding the person with whom i talked thus impenetrable to all i could say and considering that the advantage to be gained was small even if i could overcome his prepossession i took his advice and was silent it was not much longer before every thing was prepared for my departure and i was conducted to the same prison which had so lately enclosed the wretched and innocent hawkinses they too had been the victims of mr falkland he exhibited upon a contracted scale indeed but in which the truth of delineation was faithfully sustained a copy of what monarchs are who reckon among the instruments of their power prisons of state  chapter xi for my own part i had never seen a prison and like the majority of my brethren had given myself little concern to enquire what was the condition of those who committed offence against or became obnoxious to suspicion from the community oh how enviable is the most tottering shed under which the labourer retires to rest compared with the residence of these walls to me every thing was newâ€”the massy doors the resounding locks the gloomy passages the grated windows and the characteristic looks of the keepers accustomed to reject every petition and to steel their hearts against feeling and pity curiosity and a sense of my situation induced me to fix my eyes on the faces of these men but in a few minutes i drew them away with unconquerable loathing it is impossible to describe the sort of squalidness and filth with which these mansions are distinguished i have seen dirty faces in dirty apartments which have nevertheless borne the impression of health and spoke carelessness and levity rather than distress but the dirt of a prison speaks sadness to the heart and appears to be already in a state of putridity and infection i was detained for more than an hour in the apartment of the keeper one turnkey after another coming in that they might make themselves familiar with my person as i was already considered as guilty of felony to a considerable amount i underwent a rigorous search and they took from me a penknife a pair of scissars and that part of my money which was in gold it was debated whether or not these should be sealed up to be returned to me as they said as soon as i should be acquitted and had i not displayed an unexpected firmness of manner and vigour of expostulation such was probably the conduct that would have been pursued having undergone these ceremonies i was thrust into a dayroom in which all the persons then under confinement for felony were assembled to the number of eleven each of them was too much engaged in his own reflections to take notice of me of these two were imprisoned for horsestealing and three for having stolen a sheep one for shoplifting one for coining two for highwayrobbery and two for burglary the horsestealers were engaged in a game at cards which was presently interrupted by a difference of opinion attended with great vociferationâ€”they calling upon one and another to decide it to no purpose one paying no attention to their summons and another leaving them in the midst of their story being no longer able to endure his own internal anguish in the midst of their mummery it is a custom among thieves to constitute a sort of mock tribunal of their own body from whose decision every one is informed whether he shall be acquitted respited or pardoned as well as respecting the supposed most skilful way of conducting his defence one of the housebreakers who had already passed this ordeal and was stalking up and down the room with a forced bravery exclaimed to his companion that he was as rich as the duke of bedford himself he had five guineas and a half which was as much as he could possibly spend in the course of the ensuing month and what happened after that it was jack ketchs business to see to not his as he uttered these words he threw himself abruptly upon a bench that was near him and seemed to be asleep in a moment but his sleep was uneasy and disturbed his breathing was hard and at intervals had rather the nature of a groan a young fellow from the other side of the room came softly to the place where he lay with a large knife in his hand and pressed the back of it with such violence upon his neck the head hanging over the side of the bench that it was not till after several efforts that he was able to rise oh jack cried this manual jester i had almost done your business for you the other expressed no marks of resentment but sullenly answered damn you why did not you take the edge it would have been the best thing you have done this many a day  the case of one of the persons committed for highwayrobbery was not a little extraordinary he was a common soldier of a most engaging physiognomy and twoandtwenty years of age the prosecutor who had been robbed one evening as he returned late from the alehouse of the sum of three shillings swore positively to his person the character of the prisoner was such as has seldom been equalled he had been ardent in the pursuit of intellectual cultivation and was accustomed to draw his favourite amusement from the works of virgil and horace the humbleness of his situation combined with his ardour for literature only served to give an inexpressible heightening to the interestingness of his character he was plain and unaffected he assumed nothing he was capable when occasion demanded of firmness but in his ordinary deportment he seemed unarmed and unresisting unsuspicious of guile in others as he was totally free from guile in himself his integrity was proverbially great in one instance he had been intrusted by a lady to convey a sum of a thousand pounds to a person at some miles distance in another he was employed by a gentleman during his absence in the care of his house and furniture to the value of at least five times that sum his habits of thinking were strictly his own full of justice simplicity and wisdom he from time to time earned money of his officers by his peculiar excellence in furbishing arms but he declined offers that had been made him to become a serjeant or a corporal saying that he did not want money and that in a new situation he should have less leisure for study he was equally constant in refusing presents that were offered him by persons who had been struck with his merit not that he was under the influence of false delicacy and pride but that he had no inclination to accept that the want of which he did not feel to be an evil this man died while i was in prison i received his last breath  the whole day i was obliged to spend in the company of these men some of them having really committed the actions laid to their charge others whom their ill fortune had rendered the victims of suspicion the whole was a scene of misery such as nothing short of actual observation can suggest to the mind some were noisy and obstreperous endeavouring by a false bravery to keep at bay the remembrance of their condition while others incapable even of this effort had the torment of their thoughts aggravated by the perpetual noise and confusion that prevailed around them in the faces of those who assumed the most courage you might trace the furrows of anxious care and in the midst of their laboured hilarity dreadful ideas would ever and anon intrude convulsing their features and working every line into an expression of the keenest agony to these men the sun brought no return of joy day after day rolled on but their state was immutable existence was to them a scene of invariable melancholy every moment was a moment of anguish yet did they wish to prolong that moment fearful that the coming period would bring a severer fate they thought of the past with insupportable repentance each man contented to give his right hand to have again the choice of that peace and liberty which he had unthinkingly bartered away we talk of instruments of torture englishmen take credit to themselves for having banished the use of them from their happy shore alas he that has observed the secrets of a prison well knows that there is more torture in the lingering existence of a criminal in the silent intolerable minutes that he spends than in the tangible misery of whips and racks such were our days at sunset our jailors appeared and ordered each man to come away and be locked into his dungeon it was a bitter aggravation of our fate to be under the arbitrary control of these fellows they felt no mans sorrow they were of all men least capable of any sort of feeling they had a barbarous and sullen pleasure in issuing their detested mandates and observing the mournful reluctance with which they were obeyed whatever they directed it was in vain to expostulate fetters and bread and water were the sure consequences of resistance their tyranny had no other limit than their own caprice to whom shall the unfortunate felon appeal to what purpose complain when his complaints are sure to be received with incredulity a tale of mutiny and necessary precaution is the unfailing refuge of the keeper and this tale is an everlasting bar against redress our dungeons were cells     feet by     below the surface of the ground damp without window light or air except from a few holes worked for that purpose in the door in some of these miserable receptacles three persons were put to sleep together  i was fortunate enough to have one to myself it was now the approach of winter we were not allowed to have candles and as i have already said were thrust in here at sunset and not liberated till the returning day this was our situation for fourteen or fifteen hours out of the fourandtwenty i had never been accustomed to sleep more than six or seven hours and my inclination to sleep was now less than ever thus was i reduced to spend half my day in this dreary abode and in complete darkness this was no trifling aggravation of my lot among my melancholy reflections i tasked my memory and counted over the doors the locks the bolts the chains the massy walls and grated windows that were between me and liberty these said i are the engines that tyranny sits down in cold and serious meditation to invent this is the empire that man exercises over man thus is a being formed to expatiate to act to smile and enjoy restricted and benumbed how great must be his depravity or heedlessness who vindicates this scheme for changing health and gaiety and serenity into the wanness of a dungeon and the deep furrows of agony and despair thank god exclaims the englishman we have no bastile thank god with us no man can be punished without a crime unthinking wretch is that a country of liberty where thousands languish in dungeons and fetters go go ignorant fool and visit the scenes of our prisons witness their unwholesomeness their filth the tyranny of their governors the misery of their inmates after that show me the man shameless enough to triumph and say england has no bastile is there any charge so frivolous upon which men are not consigned to those detested abodes is there any villainy that is not practised by justices and prosecutors but against all this perhaps you have been told there is redress yes a redress that it is the consummation of insult so much as to name where shall the poor wretch reduced to the last despair to whom acquittal perhaps comes just time enough to save him from perishingâ€”where shall this man find leisure and much less money to fee counsel and officers and purchase the tedious dearbought remedy of the law no he is too happy to leave his dungeon and the memory of his dungeon behind him and the same tyranny and wanton oppression become the inheritance of his successor for myself i looked round upon my walls and forward upon the premature death i had too much reason to expect i consulted my own heart that whispered nothing but innocence and i said this is society this is the object the distribution of justice which is the end of human reason for this sages have toiled and midnight oil has been wasted this the reader will forgive this digression from the immediate subject of my story if it should be said these are general remarks let it be remembered that they are the dearbought result of experience it is from the fulness of a bursting heart that reproach thus flows to my pen these are not the declamations of a man desirous to be eloquent i have felt the iron of slavery grating upon my soul i believed that misery more pure than that which i now endured had never fallen to the lot of a human being i recollected with astonishment my puerile eagerness to be brought to the test and have my innocence examined i execrated it as the vilest and most insufferable pedantry i exclaimed in the bitterness of my heart of what value is a fair fame it is the jewel of men formed to be amused with baubles without it i might have had serenity of heart and cheerfulness of occupation peace and liberty why should i consign my happiness to other mens arbitration but if a fair fame were of the most inexpressible value is this the method which common sense would prescribe to retrieve it the language which these institutions hold out to the unfortunate is come and be shut out from the light of day be the associate of those whom society has marked out for her abhorrence be the slave of jailers be loaded with fetters thus shall you be cleared from every unworthy aspersion and restored to reputation and honour this is the consolation she affords to those whom malignity or folly private pique or unfounded positiveness have without the smallest foundation loaded with calumny for myself i felt my own innocence and i soon found upon enquiry that three fourths of those who are regularly subjected to a similar treatment are persons whom even with all the superciliousness and precipitation of our courts of justice no evidence can be found sufficient to convict how slender then must be that mans portion of information and discernment who is willing to commit his character and welfare to such guardianship but my case was even worse than this i intimately felt that a trial such as our institutions have hitherto been able to make it is only the worthy sequel of such a beginning what chance was there after the purgation i was now suffering that i should come out acquitted at last what probability was there that the trial i had endured in the house of mr falkland was not just as fair as any that might be expected to follow no i anticipated my own condemnation thus was i cut off for ever from all that existence has to bestowâ€”from all the high hopes i had so often conceivedâ€”from all the future excellence my soul so much delighted to imagineâ€”to spend a few weeks in a miserable prison and then to perish by the hand of the public executioner no language can do justice to the indignant and soulsickening loathing that these ideas excited my resentment was not restricted to my prosecutor but extended itself to the whole machine of society i could never believe that all this was the fair result of institutions inseparable from the general good i regarded the whole human species as so many hangmen and torturers i considered them as confederated to tear me to pieces and this wide scene of inexorable persecution inflicted upon me inexpressible agony i looked on this side and on that i was innocent i had a right to expect assistance but every heart was steeled against me every hand was ready to lend its force to make my ruin secure no man that has not felt in his own most momentous concerns justice eternal truth unalterable equity engaged in his behalf and on the other side brute force impenetrable obstinacy and unfeeling insolence can imagine the sensations that then passed through my mind i saw treachery triumphant and enthroned i saw the sinews of innocence crumbled into dust by the gripe of almighty guilt what relief had i from these sensations was it relief that i spent the day in the midst of profligacy and execrationsâ€”that i saw reflected from every countenance agonies only inferior to my own he that would form a lively idea of the regions of the damned need only to witness for six hours a scene to which i was confined for many months not for one hour could i withdraw myself from this complexity of horrors or take refuge in the calmness of meditation air exercise series contrast those grand enliveners of the human frame i was for ever debarred from by the inexorable tyranny under which i was fallen nor did i find the solitude of my nightly dungeon less insupportable its only furniture was the straw that served me for my repose it was narrow damp and unwholesome the slumbers of a mind wearied like mine with the most detestable uniformity to whom neither amusement nor occupation ever offered themselves to beguile the painful hours were short disturbed and unrefreshing my sleeping still more than my waking thoughts were full of perplexity deformity and disorder to these slumbers succeeded the hours which by the regulations of our prison i was obliged though awake to spend in solitary and cheerless darkness here i had neither books nor pens nor any thing upon which to engage my attention all was a sightless blank how was a mind active and indefatigable like mine to endure this misery i could not sink it in lethargy i could nor forget my woes they haunted me with unintermitted and demoniac malice cruel inexorable policy of human affairs that condemns a man to torture like this that sanctions it and knows not what is done under its sanction that is too supine and unfeeling to enquire into these petty details that calls this the ordeal of innocence and the protector of freedom a thousand times i could have dashed my brains against the walls of my dungeon a thousand times i longed for death and wished with inexpressible ardour for an end to what i suffered a thousand times i meditated suicide and ruminated in the bitterness of my soul upon the different means of escaping from the load of existence what had i to do with life i had seen enough to make me regard it with detestation why should i wait the lingering process of legal despotism and not dare so much as to die but when and how its instruments decreed still some inexplicable suggestion withheld my hand i clung with desperate fondness to this shadow of existence its mysterious attractions and its hopeless prospects  chapter xii such were the reflections that haunted the first days of my imprisonment in consequence of which they were spent in perpetual anguish but after a time nature wearied with distress would no longer stoop to the burthen thought which is incessantly varying introduced a series of reflections totally different my fortitude revived i had always been accustomed to cheerfulness good humour and serenity and this habit now returned to visit me at the bottom of my dungeon no sooner did my contemplations take this turn than i saw the reasonableness and possibility of tranquillity and peace and my mind whispered to me the propriety of showing in this forlorn condition that i was superior to all my persecutors blessed state of innocence and selfapprobation the sunshine of conscious integrity pierced through all the barriers of my cell and spoke ten thousand times more joy to my heart than the accumulated splendours of nature and art can communicate to the slaves of vice i found out the secret of employing my mind i said i am shut up for half the day in total darkness without any external source of amusement the other half i spend in the midst of noise turbulence and confusion what then can i not draw amusement from the stores of my own mind is it not freighted with various knowledge have i not been employed from my infancy in gratifying an insatiable curiosity when should i derive benefit from these superior advantages if not at present accordingly i tasked the stores of my memory and my powers of invention i amused myself with recollecting the history of my life by degrees i called to mind a number of minute circumstances which but for this exercise would have been for ever forgotten i repassed in my thoughts whole conversations i recollected their subjects their arrangement their incidents frequently their very words i mused upon these ideas till i was totally absorbed in thought i repeated them till my mind glowed with enthusiasm i had my different employments fitted for the solitude of the night in which i could give full scope to the impulses of my mind and for the uproar of the day in which my chief object was to be insensible to the disorder with which i was surrounded by degrees i quitted my own story and employed myself in imaginary adventures i figured to myself every situation in which i could be placed and conceived the conduct to be observed in each thus scenes of insult and danger of tenderness and oppression became familiar to me in fancy i often passed the awful hour of dissolving nature in some of my reveries i boiled with impetuous indignation and in others patiently collected the whole force of my mind for some fearful encounter i cultivated the powers of oratory suited to these different states and improved more in eloquence in the solitude of my dungeon than perhaps i should have done in the busiest and most crowded scenes at length i proceeded to as regular a disposition of my time as the man in his study who passes from mathematics to poetry and from poetry to the law of nations in the different parts of each single day and i as seldom infringed upon my plan nor were my subjects of disquisition less numerous than his i went over by the assistance of memory only a considerable part of euclid during my confinement and revived day after day the series of facts and incidents in some of the most celebrated historians i became myself a poet and while i described the sentiments cherished by the view of natural objects recorded the characters and passions of men and partook with a burning zeal in the generosity of their determinations i eluded the squalid solitude of my dungeon and wandered in idea through all the varieties of human society i easily found expedients such as the mind seems always to require and which books and pens supply to the man at large to record from time to time the progress that had been made while i was thus employed i reflected with exultation upon the degree in which man is independent of the smiles and frowns of fortune i was beyond her reach for i could fall no lower to an ordinary eye i might seem destitute and miserable but in reality i wanted for nothing my fare was coarse but i was in health my dungeon was noisome but i felt no inconvenience i was shut up from the usual means of exercise and air but i found the method of exercising myself even to perspiration in my dungeon i had no power of withdrawing my person from a disgustful society in the most cheerful and valuable part of the day but i soon brought to perfection the art of withdrawing my thoughts and saw and heard the people about me for just as short a time and as seldom as i pleased such is man in himself considered so simple his nature so few his wants how different from the man of artificial society palaces are built for his reception a thousand vehicles provided for his exercise provinces are ransacked for the gratification of his appetite and the whole world traversed to supply him with apparel and furniture thus vast is his expenditure and the purchase slavery he is dependent on a thousand accidents for tranquillity and health and his body and soul are at the devotion of whoever will satisfy his imperious cravings in addition to the disadvantages of my present situation i was reserved for an ignominious death what then every man must die no man knows how soon it surely is not worse to encounter the king of terrors in health and with every advantage for the collection of fortitude than to encounter him already half subdued by sickness and suffering i was resolved at least fully to possess the days i had to live and this is peculiarly in the power of the man who preserves his health to the last moment of his existence why should i suffer my mind to be invaded by unavailing regrets every sentiment of vanity or rather of independence and justice within me instigated me to say to my persecutor you may cut off my existence but you cannot disturb my serenity  chapter xiii in the midst of these reflections another thought which had not before struck me occurred to my mind i exult said i and reasonably over the impotence of my persecutor is not that impotence greater than i have yet imagined i say he may cut off my existence but cannot disturb my serenity it is true my mind the clearness of my spirit the firmness of my temper are beyond his reach is not my life equally so if i please what are the material obstacles that man never subdued what is the undertaking so arduous that by some has not been accomplished and if by others why not by me had they stronger motives than i was existence more variously endeared to them or had they more numerous methods by which to animate and adorn it many of those who have exerted most perseverance and intrepidity were obviously my inferiors in that respect why should not i be as daring as they adamant and steel have a ductility like water to a mind sufficiently bold and contemplative the mind is master of itself and is endowed with powers that might enable it to laugh at the tyrants vigilance i passed and repassed these ideas in my mind and heated with the contemplation i said no i will not die my reading in early youth had been extremely miscellaneous i had read of housebreakers to whom locks and bolts were a jest and who vain of their art exhibited the experiment of entering a house the most strongly barricaded with as little noise and almost as little trouble as other men would lift up a latch there is nothing so interesting to the juvenile mind as the wonderful there is no power that it so eagerly covets as that of astonishing spectators by its miraculous exertions mind appeared to my untutored reflections vague airy and unfettered the susceptible perceiver of reasons but never intended by nature to be the slave of force why should it be in the power of man to overtake and hold me by violence why when i choose to withdraw myself should i not be capable of eluding the most vigilant search these limbs and this trunk are a cumbrous and unfortunate load for the power of thinking to drag along with it but why should not the power of thinking be able to lighten the load till it shall be no longer feltâ€”these early modes of reflection were by no means indifferent to my present enquiries our nextdoor neighbour at my fathers house had been a carpenter fresh from the sort of reading i have mentioned i was eager to examine his tools their powers and their uses this carpenter was a man of strong and vigorous mind and his faculties having been chiefly confined to the range of his profession he was fertile in experiments and ingenious in reasoning upon these particular topics i therefore obtained from him considerable satisfaction and my mind being set in action i sometimes even improved upon the hints he furnished his conversation was particularly agreeable to me i at first worked with him sometimes for my amusement and afterwards occasionally for a short time as his journeyman i was constitutionally vigorous and by the experience thus attained i added to the abstract possession of power the skill of applying it when i pleased in such a manner as that no part should be inefficient it is a strange but no uncommon feature in the human mind that the very resource of which we stand in greatest need in a critical situation though already accumulated it may be by preceding industry fails to present itself at the time when it should be called into action thus my mind had passed through two very different stages since my imprisonment before this means of liberation suggested itself my faculties were overwhelmed in the first instance and raised to a pitch of enthusiasm in the second while in both i took it for granted in a manner that i must passively submit to the good pleasure of my persecutors during the period in which my mind had been thus undecided and when i had been little more than a month in durance the assizes which were held twice a year in the town in which i was a prisoner came on upon this occasion my case was not brought forward but was suffered to stand over six months longer it would have been just the same if i had had as strong reason to expect acquittal as i had conviction if i had been apprehended upon the most frivolous reasons upon which any justice of the peace ever thought proper to commit a naked beggar for trial i must still have waited about two hundred and seventeen days before my innocence could be cleared so imperfect are the effects of the boasted laws of a country whose legislators hold their assembly from four to six months in every year i could never discover with certainty whether this delay were owing to any interference on the part of my prosecutor or whether it fell out in the regular administration of justice which is too solemn and dignified to accommodate itself to the rights or benefit of an insignificant individual but this was not the only incident that occurred to me during my confinement for which i could find no satisfactory solution it was nearly at the same time that the keeper began to alter his behaviour to me he sent for me one morning into the part of the building which was appropriated for his own use and after some hesitation told me he was sorry my accommodations had been so indifferent and asked whether i should like to have a chamber in his family i was struck with the unexpectedness of this question and desired to know whether any body had employed him to ask it no he replied but now the assizes were over he had fewer felons on his hands and more time to look about him he believed i was a good kind of a young man and he had taken a sort of a liking to me i fixed my eye upon his countenance as he said this i could discover none of the usual symptoms of kindness he appeared to me to be acting a part unnatural and that sat with awkwardness upon him he went on however to offer me the liberty of eating at his table which if i chose it he said would make no difference to him and he should not think of charging me any thing for it he had always indeed as much upon his hands as one person could see to but his wife and his daughter peggy would be woundily pleased to hear a person of learning talk as he understood i was and perhaps i might not feel myself unpleasantly circumstanced in their company i reflected on this proposal and had little doubt notwithstanding what the keeper had affirmed to the contrary that it did not proceed from any spontaneous humanity in him but that he had to speak the language of persons of his cast good reasons for what he did i busied myself in conjectures as to who could be the author of this sort of indulgence and attention the two most likely persons were mr falkland and mr forester the latter i knew to be a man austere and inexorable towards those whom he deemed vicious he piqued himself upon being insensible to those softer emotions which he believed answered no other purpose than to seduce us from our duty mr falkland on the contrary was a man of the acutest sensibility hence arose his pleasures and his pains his virtues and his vices though he were the bitterest enemy to whom i could possibly be exposed and though no sentiments of humanity could divert or control the bent of his mind i yet persuaded myself that he was more likely than his kinsman to visit in idea the scene of my dungeon and to feel impelled to alleviate my sufferings this conjecture was by no means calculated to serve as balm to my mind my thoughts were full of irritation against my persecutor how could i think kindly of a man in competition with the gratification of whose ruling passion my good name or my life was deemed of no consideration i saw him crushing the one and bringing the other into jeopardy with a quietness and composure on his part that i could not recollect without horror i knew not what were his plans respecting me i knew not whether he troubled himself so much as to form a barren wish for the preservation of one whose future prospects he had so iniquitously tarnished i had hitherto been silent as to my principal topic of recrimination but i was by no means certain that i should consent to go out of the world in silence the victim of this mans obduracy and art in every view i felt my heart ulcerated with a sense of his injustice and my very soul spurned these pitiful indulgences at a time that he was grinding me into dust with the inexorableness of his vengeance i was influenced by these sentiments in my reply to the jailor and i found a secret pleasure in pronouncing them in all their bitterness i viewed him with a sarcastic smile and said i was glad to find him of a sudden become so humane i was not however without some penetration as to the humanity of a jailor and could guess at the circumstances by which it was produced but he might tell his employer that his cares were fruitless i would accept no favours from a man that held a halter about my neck and had courage enough to endure the worst both in time to come and nowâ€”the jailor looked at me with astonishment and turning upon his heel exclaimed well done my cock you have not had your learning for nothing i see you are set upon not dying dunghill but that is to come lad you had better by half keep your courage till you shall find it wanted the assizes which passed over without influence to me produced a great revolution among my fellowprisoners i lived long enough in the jail to witness a general mutation of its inhabitants one of the housebreakers the rival of the duke of bedford and the coiner were hanged two more were cast for transportation and the rest acquitted the transports remained with us and though the prison was thus lightened of nine of its inhabitants there were at the next halfyearly period of assizes as many persons on the felons side within three as i had found on my first arrival the soldier whose story i have already recorded died on the evening of the very day on which the judges arrived of a disease the consequence of his confinement such was the justice that resulted from the laws of his country to an individual who would have been the ornament of any age one who of all the men i ever knew was perhaps the kindest of the most feeling heart of the most engaging and unaffected manners and the most unblemished life the name of this man was brightwel were it possible for my pen to consecrate him to neverdying fame i could undertake no task more grateful to my heart his judgment was penetrating and manly totally unmixed with imbecility and confusion while at the same time there was such an uncontending frankness in his countenance that a superficial observer would have supposed he must have been the prey of the first plausible knavery that was practised against him great reason have i to remember him with affection he was the most ardent i had almost said the last of my friends nor did i remain in this respect in his debt there was indeed a great congeniality if i may presume to say so in our characters except that i cannot pretend to rival the originality and selfcreated vigour of his mind or to compare with what the world has scarcely surpassed the correctness and untainted purity of his conduct he heard my story as far as i thought proper to disclose it with interest he examined it with sincere impartiality and if at first any doubt remained upon his mind a frequent observation of me in my most unguarded moments taught him in no long time to place an unreserved confidence in my innocence he talked of the injustice of which we were mutual victims without bitterness and delighted to believe that the time would come when the possibility of such intolerable oppression would be extirpated but this he said was a happiness reserved for posterity it was too late for us to reap the benefit of it it was some consolation to him that he could not tell the period in his past life which the best judgment of which he was capable would teach him to spend better he could say with as much reason as most men he had discharged his duty but he foresaw that he should not survive his present calamity this was his prediction while yet in health he might be said in a certain sense to have a broken heart but if that phrase were in any way applicable to him sure never was despair more calm more full of resignation and serenity at no time in the whole course of my adventures was i exposed to a shock more severe than i received from this mans death the circumstances of his fate presented themselves to my mind in their full complication of iniquity from him and the execrations with which i loaded the government that could be the instrument of his tragedy i turned to myself i beheld the catastrophe of brightwel with envy a thousand times i longed that my corse had lain in death instead of his i was only reserved as i persuaded myself for unutterable woe in a few days he would have been acquitted his liberty his reputation restored mankind perhaps struck with the injustice he had suffered would have shown themselves eager to balance his misfortunes and obliterate his disgrace but this man died and i remained alive i who though not less wrongfully treated than he had no hope of reparation must be marked as long as i lived for a villain and in my death probably held up to the scorn and detestation of my species such were some of the immediate reflections which the fate of this unfortunate martyr produced in my mind yet my intercourse with brightwel was not in the review without its portion of comfort i said this man has seen through the veil of calumny that overshades me he has understood and has loved me why should i despair may i not meet hereafter with men ingenuous like him who shall do me justice and sympathise with my calamity with that consolation i will be satisfied i will rest in the arms of friendship and forget the malignity of the world henceforth i will be contented with tranquil obscurity with the cultivation of sentiment and wisdom and the exercise of benevolence within a narrow circle it was thus that my mind became excited to the project i was about to undertake i had no sooner meditated the idea of an escape than i determined upon the following method of facilitating the preparations for it i undertook to ingratiate myself with my keeper in the world i have generally found such persons as had been acquainted with the outline of my story regarding me with a sort of loathing and abhorrence which made them avoid me with as much care as if i had been spotted with the plague the idea of my having first robbed my patron and then endeavouring to clear myself by charging him with subornation against me placed me in a class distinct from and infinitely more guilty than that of common felons but this man was too good a master of his profession to entertain aversion against a fellowcreature upon that score he considered the persons committed to his custody merely as so many human bodies for whom he was responsible that they should be forthcoming in time and place and the difference of innocence and guilt he looked down upon as an affair beneath his attention i had not therefore the prejudices to encounter in recommending myself to him that i have found so peculiarly obstinate in other cases add to which the same motive whatever it was that had made him so profuse in his offers a little before had probably its influence on the present occasion i informed him of my skill in the profession of a joiner and offered to make him half a dozen handsome chairs if he would facilitate my obtaining the tools necessary for carrying on my profession in my present confinement for without his consent previously obtained it would have been in vain for me to expect that i could quietly exert an industry of this kind even if my existence had depended upon it he looked at me first as asking himself what he was to understand by this novel proposal and then his countenance most graciously relaxing said he was glad i was come off a little of my high notions and my buckram and he would see what he could do two days after he signified his compliance he said that as to the matter of the present i had offered him he thought nothing of that i might do as i pleased in it but i might depend upon every civility from him that he could show with safety to himself if so be as when he was civil i did not offer a second time for to snap and take him up short having thus gained my preliminary i gradually accumulated tools of various sortsâ€”gimlets piercers chisels et cetera i immediately set myself to work the nights were long and the sordid eagerness of my keeper notwithstanding his ostentatious generosity was great i therefore petitioned for and was indulged with a bit of candle that i might amuse myself for an hour or two with my work after i was locked up in my dungeon i did not however by any means apply constantly to the work i had undertaken and my jailor betrayed various tokens of impatience perhaps he was afraid i should not have finished it before i was hanged i however insisted upon working at my leisure as i pleased and this he did not venture expressly to dispute in addition to the advantages thus obtained i procured secretly from miss peggy who now and then came into the jail to make her observations of the prisoners and who seemed to have conceived some partiality for my person the implement of an iron crow in these proceedings it is easy to trace the vice and duplicity that must be expected to grow out of injustice i know not whether my readers will pardon the sinister advantage i extracted from the mysterious concessions of my keeper but i must acknowledge my weakness in that respect i am writing my adventures and not my apology and i was not prepared to maintain the unvaried sincerity of my manners at the expense of a speedy close of my existence my plan was now digested i believed that by means of the crow i could easily and without much noise force the door of my dungeon from its hinges or if not that i could in case of necessity cut away the lock this door led into a narrow passage bounded on one side by the range of dungeons and on the other by the jailors and turnkeys apartments through which was the usual entrance from the street this outlet i dared not attempt for fear of disturbing the persons close to whose very door i should in that case have found it necessary to pass i determined therefore upon another door at the further end of the passage which was well barricaded and which led to a sort of garden in the occupation of the keeper this garden i had never entered but i had had an opportunity of observing it from the window of the felons dayroom which looked that way the room itself being immediately over the range of dungeons i perceived that it was bounded by a wall of considerable height which i was told by my fellowprisoners was the extremity of the jail on that side and beyond which was a backlane of some length that terminated in the skirts of the town upon an accurate observation and much reflection upon the subject i found i should be able if once i got into the garden with my gimlets and piercers inserted at proper distances to make a sort of ladder by means of which i could clear the wall and once more take possession of the sweets of liberty i preferred this wall to that which immediately skirted my dungeon on the other side of which was a populous street i suffered about two days to elapse from the period at which i had thoroughly digested my project and then in the very middle of the night began to set about its execution the first door was attended with considerable difficulty but at length this obstacle was happily removed the second door was fastened on the inside i was therefore able with perfect ease to push back the bolts but the lock which of course was depended upon for the principal security and was therefore strong was doubleshot and the key taken away i endeavoured with my chisel to force back the bolt of the lock but to no purpose i then unscrewed the box of the lock and that being taken away the door was no longer opposed to my wishes thus far i had proceeded with the happiest success but close on the other side of the door there was a kennel with a large mastiff dog of which i had not the smallest previous knowledge though i stepped along in the most careful manner this animal was disturbed and began to bark i was extremely disconcerted but immediately applied myself to soothe the animal in which i presently succeeded i then returned along the passage to listen whether any body had been disturbed by the noise of the dog resolved if that had been the case that i would return to my dungeon and endeavour to replace every thing in its former state but the whole appeared perfectly quiet and i was encouraged to proceed in my operation i now got to the wall and had nearly gained half the ascent when i heard a voice at the gardendoor crying holloa who is there who opened the door the man received no answer and the night was too dark for him to distinguish objects at any distance he therefore returned as i judged into the house for a light meantime the dog understanding the key in which these interrogations were uttered began barking again more violently than ever i had now no possibility of retreat and i was not without hopes that i might yet accomplish my object and clear the wall meanwhile a second man came out while the other was getting his lantern and by the time i had got to the top of the wall was able to perceive me he immediately set up a shout and threw a large stone which grazed me in its flight alarmed at my situation i was obliged to descend on the other side without taking the necessary precautions and in my fall nearly dislocated my ankle there was a door in the wall of which i was not previously apprised and this being opened the two men with the lantern were on the other side in an instant they had then nothing to do but to run along the lane to the place from which i had descended i endeavoured to rise after my fall but the pain was so intense that i was scarcely able to stand and after having limped a few paces i twisted my foot under me and fell down again i had now no remedy and quietly suffered myself to be retaken  chapter xiv i was conducted to the keepers room for that night and the two men sat up with me i was accosted with many interrogatories to which i gave little answer but complained of the hurt in my leg to this i could obtain no reply except curse you my lad if that be all we will give you some ointment for that we will anoint it with a little cold iron they were indeed excessively sulky with me for having broken their nights rest and given them all this trouble in the morning they were as good as their word fixing a pair of fetters upon both my legs regardless of the ankle which was now swelled to a considerable size and then fastening me with a padlock to a staple in the floor of my dungeon i expostulated with warmth upon this treatment and told them that i was a man upon whom the law as yet had passed no censure and who therefore in the eye of the law was innocent but they bid me keep such fudge for people who knew no better they knew what they did and would answer it to any court in england the pain of the fetter was intolerable i endeavoured in various ways to relieve it and even privily to free my leg but the more it was swelled the more was this rendered impossible i then resolved to bear it with patience still the longer it continued the worse it grew after two days and two nights i entreated the turnkey to go and ask the surgeon who usually attended the prison to look at it for if it continued longer as it was i was convinced it would mortify but he glared surlily at me and said damn my blood i should like to see that day to die of a mortification is too good an end for such a rascal at the time that he thus addressed me the whole mass of my blood was already fevered by the anguish i had undergone my patience was wholly exhausted and i was silly enough to be irritated beyond bearing by his impertinence and vulgarity look you mr turnkey said i there is one thing that such fellows as you are set over us for and another thing that you are not you are to take care we do not escape but it is no part of your office to call us names and abuse us if i were not chained to the floor you dare as well eat your fingers as use such language and take my word for it you shall yet live to repent of your insolence while i thus spoke the man stared at me with astonishment he was so little accustomed to such retorts that at first he could scarcely believe his ears and such was the firmness of my manner that he seemed to forget for a moment that i was not at large but as soon as he had time to recollect himself he did not deign to be angry his face relaxed into a smile of contempt he snapped his fingers at me and turning upon his heel exclaimed well said my cock crow away have a care you do not burst and as he shut the door upon me mimicked the voice of the animal he mentioned this rejoinder brought me to myself in a moment and showed me the impotence of the resentment i was expressing but though he thus put an end to the violence of my speech the torture of my body continued as great as ever i was determined to change my mode of attack the same turnkey returned in a few minutes and as he approached me to put down some food he had brought i slipped a shilling into his hand saying at the same time my good fellow for gods sake go to the surgeon i am sure you do not wish me to perish for want of assistance the fellow put the shilling into his pocket looked hard at me and then with one nod of his head and without uttering a single word went away the surgeon presently after made his appearance and finding the part in a high state of inflammation ordered certain applications and gave peremptory directions that the fetter should not be replaced upon that leg till a cure had been effected it was a full month before the leg was perfectly healed and made equally strong and flexible with the other the condition in which i was now placed was totally different from that which had preceded this attempt i was chained all day in my dungeon with no other mitigation except that the door was regularly opened for a few hours in an afternoon at which time some of the prisoners occasionally came and spoke to me particularly one who though he could ill replace my benevolent brightwel was not deficient in excellent qualities this was no other than the individual whom mr falkland had some months before dismissed upon an accusation of murder his courage was gone his garb was squalid and the comeliness and clearness of his countenance was utterly obliterated he also was innocent worthy brave and benevolent he was i believe afterwards acquitted and turned loose to wander a desolate and perturbed spectre through the world my manual labours were now at an end my dungeon was searched every night and every kind of tool carefully kept from me the straw which had been hitherto allowed me was removed under pretence that it was adapted for concealment and the only conveniences with which i was indulged were a chair and a blanket a prospect of some alleviation in no long time opened upon me but this my usual ill fortune rendered abortive the keeper once more made his appearance and with his former constitutional and ambiguous humanity he pretended to be surprised at my want of every accommodation he reprehended in strong terms my attempt to escape and observed that there must be an end of civility from people in his situation if gentlemen after all would not know when they were well it was necessary in cases the like of this to let the law take its course and it would be ridiculous in me to complain if after a regular trial things should go hard with me he was desirous of being in every respect my friend if i would let him in the midst of this circumlocution and preamble he was called away from me for something relating to the business of his office in the mean time i ruminated upon his overtures and detesting as i did the source from which i conceived them to flow i could not help reflecting how far it would be possible to extract from them the means of escape but my meditations in this case were vain the keeper returned no more during the remainder of that day and on the next an incident occurred which put an end to all expectations from his kindness an active mind which has once been forced into any particular train can scarcely be persuaded to desert it as hopeless i had studied my chains during the extreme anguish that i endured from the pressure of the fetter upon the ankle which had been sprained and though from the swelling and acute sensibility of the part i had found all attempts at relief in that instance impracticable i obtained from the coolness of my investigation another and apparently superior advantage during the night my dungeon was in a complete state of darkness but when the door was open the case was somewhat different the passage indeed into which it opened was so narrow and the opposite dead wall so near that it was but a glimmering and melancholy light that entered my apartment even at full noon and when the door was at its widest extent but my eyes after a practice of two or three weeks accommodated themselves to this circumstance and i learned to distinguish the minutest object one day as i was alternately meditating and examining the objects around me i chanced to observe a nail trodden into the mudfloor at no great distance from me i immediately conceived the desire of possessing myself of this implement but for fear of surprise people passing perpetually to and fro i contented myself for the present with remarking its situation so accurately that i might easily find it again in the dark accordingly as soon as my door was shut i seized upon this new treasure and having contrived to fashion it to my purpose found that i could unlock with it the padlock that fastened me to the staple in the floor this i regarded as no inconsiderable advantage separately from the use i might derive from it in relation to my principal object my chain permitted me to move only about eighteen inches to the right or left and having borne this confinement for several weeks my very heart leaped at the pitiful consolation of being able to range without constraint the miserable coop in which i was immured this incident had occurred several days previously to the last visit of my keeper from this time it had been my constant practice to liberate myself every night and not to replace things in their former situation till i awoke in the morning and expected shortly to perceive the entrance of the turnkey security breeds negligence on the morning succeeding my conference with the jailor it so happened whether i overslept myself or the turnkey went his round earlier than usual that i was roused from my sleep by the noise he made in opening the cell next to my own and though i exerted the utmost diligence yet having to grope for my materials in the dark i was unable to fasten the chain to the staple before he entered as usual with his lantern he was extremely surprised to find me disengaged and immediately summoned the principal keeper i was questioned respecting my method of proceeding and as i believed concealment could lead to nothing but a severer search and a more accurate watch i readily acquainted them with the exact truth the illustrious personage whose functions it was to control the inhabitants of these walls was by this last instance completely exasperated against me artifice and fair speaking were at an end his eyes sparkled with fury he exclaimed that he was now convinced of the folly of showing kindness to rascals the scum of the earth such as i was and damn him if any body should catch him at that again towards any one i had cured him effectually he was astonished that the laws had not provided some terrible retaliation for thieves that attempted to deceive their jailors hanging was a thousand times too good for me having vented his indignation he proceeded to give such orders as the united instigations of anger and alarm suggested to his mind my apartment was changed i was conducted to a room called the strong room the door of which opened into the middle cell of the range of dungeons it was underground as they were and had also the dayroom for felons already described immediately over it it was spacious and dreary the door had not been opened for years the air was putrid and the walls hung round with damps and mildew the fetters the padlock and the staple were employed as in the former case in addition to which they put on me a pair of handcuffs for my first provision the keeper sent me nothing but a bit of bread mouldy and black and some dirty and stinking water i know not indeed whether this is to be regarded as gratuitous tyranny on the part of the jailor the law having providently directed in certain cases that the water to be administered to the prisoners shall be taken from the next sink or puddle nearest to the jail  it was further ordered that one of the turnkeys should sleep in the cell that formed a sort of antichamber to my apartment though every convenience was provided to render this chamber fit for the reception of a personage of a dignity so superior to the felon he was appointed to guard he expressed much dissatisfaction at the mandate but there was no alternative the situation to which i was thus removed was apparently the most undesirable that could be imagined but i was not discouraged i had for some time learned not to judge by appearances the apartment was dark and unwholesome but i had acquired the secret of counteracting these influences my door was kept continually shut and the other prisoners were debarred access to me but if the intercourse of our fellowmen has its pleasure solitude on the other hand is not without its advantages in solitude we can pursue our own thoughts undisturbed and i was able to call up at will the most pleasing avocations besides which to one who meditated such designs as now filled my mind solitude had peculiar recommendations i was scarcely left to myself before i tried an experiment the idea of which i conceived while they were fixing my handcuffs and with my teeth only disengaged myself from this restraint the hours at which i was visited by the keepers were regular and i took care to be provided for them add to which i had a narrow grated window near the ceiling about nine inches in perpendicular and a foot and a half horizontally which though small admitted a much stronger light than that to which i had been accustomed for several weeks thus circumstanced i scarcely ever found myself in total darkness and was better provided against surprises than i had been in my preceding situation such were the sentiments which this change of abode immediately suggested i had been a very little time removed when i received an unexpected visit from thomas mr falklands footman whom i have already mentioned in the course of my narrative a servant of mr forester happened to come to the town where i was imprisoned a few weeks before while i was confined with the hurt in my ankle and had called in to see me the account he gave of what he observed had been the source of many an uneasy sensation to thomas the former visit was a matter of mere curiosity but thomas was of the better order of servants he was considerably struck at the sight of me though my mind was now serene and my health sufficiently good yet the floridness of my complexion was gone and there was a rudeness in my physiognomy the consequence of hardship and fortitude extremely unlike the sleekness of my better days thomas looked alternately in my face at my hands and my feet and then fetched a deep sigh after a pause lord bless us said he in a voice in which commiseration was sufficiently perceptible is this you why not thomas you knew i was sent to prison did not you prison and must people in prison be shackled and bound of that fashionâ€”and where do you lay of nights here here why there is no bed no thomas i am not allowed a bed i had straw formerly but that is taken away and do they take off them there things of nights no i am expected to sleep just as you see sleep why i thought this was a christian country but this usage is too bad for a dog you must not say so thomas it is what the wisdom of government has thought fit to provide zounds how i have been deceived they told me what a fine thing it was to be an englishman and about liberty and property and all that there and i find it is all a flam lord what fools we be things are done under our very noses and we know nothing of the matter and a parcel of fellows with grave faces swear to us that such things never happen but in france and other countries the like of that why you hant been tried ha you no and what signifies being tried when they do worse than hang a man and all beforehand well master williams you have been very wicked to be sure and i thought it would have done me good to see you hanged but i do not know how it is ones heart melts and pity comes over one if we take time to cool i know that ought not to be but damn it when i talked of your being hanged i did not think of your suffering all this into the bargain soon after this conversation thomas left me the idea of the long connection of our families rushed upon his memory and he felt more for my sufferings at the moment than i did for myself in the afternoon i was surprised to see him again he said that he could not get the thought of me out of his mind and therefore he hoped i would not be displeased at his coming once more to take leave of me i could perceive that he had something upon his mind which he did not know how to discharge one of the turnkeys had each time come into the room with him and continued as long as he staid upon some avocation howeverâ€”a noise i believe in the passageâ€”the turnkey went as far as the door to satisfy his curiosity and thomas watching the opportunity slipped into my hand a chisel a file and a saw exclaiming at the same time with a sorrowful tone i know i am doing wrong but if they hang me too i cannot help it i cannot do no other for christs sake get out of this place i cannot bear the thoughts of it i received the implements with great joy and thrust them into my bosom and as soon as he was gone concealed them in the rushes of my chair for himself he had accomplished the object for which he came and presently after bade me farewell the next day the keepers i know not for what reason were more than usually industrious in their search saying though without assigning any ground for their suspicion that they were sure i had some tool in my possession that i ought not but the depository i had chosen escaped them i waited from this time the greater part of a week that i might have the benefit of a bright moonlight it was necessary that i should work in the night it was necessary that my operations should be performed between the last visit of the keepers at night and their first in the morning that is between nine in the evening and seven in my dungeon as i have already said i passed fourteen or sixteen hours of the fourandtwenty undisturbed but since i had acquired a character for mechanical ingenuity a particular exception with respect to me was made from the general rules of the prison it was ten oclock when i entered on my undertaking the room in which i was confined was secured with a double door this was totally superfluous for the purpose of my detention since there was a sentinel planted on the outside but it was very fortunate for my plan because these doors prevented the easy communication of sound and afforded me tolerable satisfaction that with a little care in my mode of proceeding i might be secure against the danger of being overheard i first took off my handcuffs i then filed through my fetters and next performed the same service to three of the iron bars that secured my window to which i climbed partly by the assistance of my chair and partly by means of certain irregularities in the wall all this was the work of more than two hours when the bars were filed through i easily forced them a little from the perpendicular and then drew them one by one out of the wall into which they were sunk about three inches perfectly straight and without any precaution to prevent their being removed but the space thus obtained was by no means wide enough to admit the passing of my body i therefore applied myself partly with my chisel and partly with one of the iron bars to the loosening the brickwork and when i had thus disengaged four or five bricks i got down and piled them upon the floor this operation i repeated three or four times the space was now sufficient for my purpose and having crept through the opening i stepped upon a shed on the outside i was now in a kind of rude area between two dead walls that south of the felons dayroom the windows of which were at the east end and the wall of the prison but i had not as formerly any instruments to assist me in scaling the wall which was of considerable height there was of consequence no resource for me but that of effecting a practicable breach in the lower part of the wall which was of no contemptible strength being of stone on the outside with a facing of brick within the rooms for the debtors were at right angles with the building from which i had just escaped and as the night was extremely bright i was in momentary danger particularly in case of the least noise of being discovered by them several of their windows commanding this area thus circumstanced i determined to make the shed answer the purpose of concealment it was locked but with the broken link of my fetters which i had had the precaution to bring with me i found no great difficulty in opening the lock i had now got a sufficient means of hiding my person while i proceeded in my work attended with no other disadvantage than that of being obliged to leave the door through which i had thus broken a little open for the sake of light after some time i had removed a considerable part of the brickwork of the outer wall but when i came to the stone i found the undertaking infinitely more difficult the mortar which bound together the building was by length of time nearly petrified and appeared to my first efforts one solid rock of the hardest adamant i had now been six hours incessantly engaged in incredible labour my chisel broke in the first attempt upon this new obstacle and between fatigue already endured and the seemingly invincible difficulty before me i concluded that i must remain where i was and gave up the idea of further effort as useless at the same time the moon whose light had till now been of the greatest use to me set and i was left in total darkness after a respite of ten minutes however i returned to the attack with new vigour it could not be less than two hours before the first stone was loosened from the edifice in one hour more the space was sufficient to admit of my escape the pile of bricks i had left in the strong room was considerable but it was a molehill compared with the ruins i had forced from the outer wall i am fully assured that the work i had thus performed would have been to a common labourer with every advantage of tools the business of two or three days but my difficulties instead of being ended seemed to be only begun the day broke before i had completed the opening and in ten minutes more the keepers would probably enter my apartment and perceive the devastation i had left the lane which connected the side of the prison through which i had escaped with the adjacent country was formed chiefly by two dead walls with here and there a stable a few warehouses and some mean habitations tenanted by the lower order of people my best security lay in clearing the town as soon as possible and depending upon the open country for protection my arms were intolerably swelled and bruised with my labour and my strength seemed wholly exhausted with fatigue speed i was nearly unable to exert for any continuance and if i could with the enemy so close at my heels speed would too probably have been useless it appeared as if i were now in almost the same situation as that in which i had been placed five or six weeks before in which after having completed my escape i was obliged to yield myself up without resistance to my pursuers i was not however disabled as then i was capable of exertion to what precise extent i could not ascertain and i was well aware that every instance in which i should fail of my purpose would contribute to enhance the difficulty of any future attempt such were the considerations that presented themselves in relation to my escape and even if that were effected i had to reckon among my difficulties that at the time i quitted my prison i was destitute of every resource and had not a shilling remaining in the world  volume the third  chapter i i passed along the lane i have described without perceiving or being observed by a human being the doors were shut the windowshutters closed and all was still as night i reached the extremity of the lane unmolested my pursuers if they immediately followed would know that the likelihood was small of my having in the interval found shelter in this place and would proceed without hesitation as i on my part was obliged to do from the end nearest to the prison to its furthest termination the face of the country in the spot to which i had thus opened myself a passage was rude and uncultivated it was overgrown with brushwood and furze the soil was for the most part of a loose sand and the surface extremely irregular i climbed a small eminence and could perceive not very remote in the distance a few cottages thinly scattered this prospect did not altogether please me i conceived that my safety would for the present be extremely assisted by keeping myself from the view of any human being i therefore came down again into the valley and upon a careful examination perceived that it was interspersed with cavities some deeper than others but all of them so shallow as neither to be capable of hiding a man nor of exciting suspicion as places of possible concealment meanwhile the day had but just begun to dawn the morning was lowering and drizzly and though the depth of these caverns was of course well known to the neighbouring inhabitants the shadows they cast were so black and impenetrable as might well have produced wider expectations in the mind of a stranger poor therefore as was the protection they were able to afford i thought it right to have recourse to it for the moment as the best the emergency would supply it was for my life and the greater was the jeopardy to which it was exposed the more dear did that life seem to become to my affections the recess i chose as most secure was within little more than a hundred yards of the end of the lane and the extreme buildings of the town i had not stood up in this manner two minutes before i heard the sound of feet and presently saw the ordinary turnkey and another pass the place of my retreat they were so close to me that if i had stretched out my hand i believe i could have caught hold of their clothes without so much as changing my posture as no part of the overhanging earth intervened between me and them i could see them entire though the deepness of the shade rendered me almost completely invisible i heard them say to each other in tones of vehement asperity curse the rascal which way can he be gone the reply was damn him i wish we had him but safe once againâ€”never fear rejoined the first he cannot have above half a mile the start of us they were presently out of hearing for as to sight i dared not advance my body so much as an inch to look after them lest i should be discovered by my pursuers in some other direction from the very short time that elapsed between my escape and the appearance of these men i concluded that they had made their way through the same outlet as i had done it being impossible that they could have had time to come from the gate of the prison and so round a considerable part of the town as they must otherwise have done i was so alarmed at this instance of diligence on the part of the enemy that for some time i scarcely ventured to proceed an inch from my place of concealment or almost to change my posture the morning which had been bleak and drizzly was succeeded by a day of heavy and incessant rain and the gloomy state of the air and surrounding objects together with the extreme nearness of my prison and a total want of food caused me to pass the hours in no very agreeable sensations this inclemency of the weather however which generated a feeling of stillness and solitude encouraged me by degrees to change my retreat for another of the same nature out of somewhat greater security i hovered with little variation about a single spot as long as the sun continued above the horizon towards evening the clouds began to disperse and the moon shone as on the preceding night in full brightness i had perceived no human creature during the whole day except in the instance already mentioned this had perhaps been owing to the nature of the day at all events i considered it as too hazardous an experiment to venture from my hidingplace in so clear and fine a night i was therefore obliged to wait for the setting of this luminary which was not till near five oclock in the morning my only relief during this interval was to allow myself to sink to the bottom of my cavern it being scarcely possible for me to continue any longer on my feet here i fell into an interrupted and unrefreshing doze the consequence of a laborious night and a tedious melancholy day though i rather sought to avoid sleep which cooperating with the coldness of the season would tend more to injury than advantage the period of darkness which i had determined to use for the purpose of removing to a greater distance from my prison was in its whole duration something less than three hours when i rose from my seat i was weak with hunger and fatigue and which was worse i seemed between the dampness of the preceding day and the sharp clear frost of the night to have lost the command of my limbs i stood up and shook myself i leaned against the side of the hill impelling in different directions the muscles of the extremities and at length recovered in some degree the sense of feeling this operation was attended with an incredible aching pain and required no common share of resolution to encounter and prosecute it having quitted my retreat i at first advanced with weak and tottering steps but as i proceeded increased my pace the barren heath which reached to the edge of the town was at least on this side without a path but the stars shone and guiding myself by them i determined to steer as far as possible from the hateful scene where i had been so long confined the line i pursued was of irregular surface sometimes obliging me to climb a steep ascent and at others to go down into a dark and impenetrable dell i was often compelled by the dangerousness of the way to deviate considerably from the direction i wished to pursue in the mean time i advanced with as much rapidity as these and similar obstacles would permit me to do the swiftness of the motion and the thinness of the air restored to me my alacrity i forgot the inconveniences under which i laboured and my mind became lively spirited and enthusiastic i had now reached the border of the heath and entered upon what is usually termed the forest strange as it may seem it is nevertheless true that in this conjuncture exhausted with hunger destitute of all provision for the future and surrounded with the most alarming dangers my mind suddenly became glowing animated and cheerful i thought that by this time the most formidable difficulties of my undertaking were surmounted and i could not believe that after having effected so much i should find any thing invincible in what remained to be done i recollected the confinement i had undergone and the fate that had impended over me with horror never did man feel more vividly than i felt at that moment the sweets of liberty never did man more strenuously prefer poverty with independence to the artificial allurements of a life of slavery i stretched forth my arms with rapture i clapped my hands one upon the other and exclaimed ah this is indeed to be a man these wrists were lately galled with fetters all my motions whether i rose up or sat down were echoed to with the clanking of chains i was tied down like a wild beast and could not move but in a circle of a few feet in circumference now i can run fleet as a greyhound and leap like a young roe upon the mountains oh god if god there be that condescends to record the lonely beatings of an anxious heart thou only canst tell with what delight a prisoner just broke forth from his dungeon hugs the blessings of newfound liberty sacred and indescribable moment when man regains his rights but lately i held my life in jeopardy because one man was unprincipled enough to assert what he knew to be false i was destined to suffer an early and inexorable death from the hands of others because none of them had penetration enough to distinguish from falsehood what i uttered with the entire conviction of a fullfraught heart strange that men from age to age should consent to hold their lives at the breath of another merely that each in his turn may have a power of acting the tyrant according to law oh god give me poverty shower upon me all the imaginary hardships of human life i will receive them all with thankfulness turn me a prey to the wild beasts of the desert so i be never again the victim of man dressed in the goredripping robes of authority suffer me at least to call life and the pursuits of life my own let me hold it at the mercy of the elements of the hunger of beasts or the revenge of barbarians but not of the coldblooded prudence of monopolists and kingsâ€”how enviable was the enthusiasm which could thus furnish me with energy in the midst of hunger poverty and universal desertion i had now walked at least six miles at first i carefully avoided the habitations that lay in my way and feared to be seen by any of the persons to whom they belonged lest it should in any degree furnish a clue to the researches of my pursuers as i went forward i conceived it might be proper to relax a part of my precaution at this time i perceived several persons coming out of a thicket close to me i immediately considered this circumstance as rather favourable than the contrary it was necessary for me to avoid entering any of the towns and villages in the vicinity it was however full time that i should procure for myself some species of refreshment and by no means improbable that these men might be in some way assisting to me in that respect in my situation it appeared to me indifferent what might be their employment or profession i had little to apprehend from thieves and i believed that they as well as honest men could not fail to have some compassion for a person under my circumstances i therefore rather threw myself in their way than avoided them they were thieves one of the company cried out who goes there stand i accosted them gentlemen said i i am a poor traveller almostâ€”while i spoke they came round me and he that had first hailed me said damn me tip us none of your palaver we have heard that story of a poor traveller any time these five years come down with your dust let us see what you have gotâ€”sir i replied i have not a shilling in the world and am more than half starved besideâ€”not a shilling answered my assailant what i suppose you are as poor as a thief but if you have not money you have clothes and those you must resign my clothes rejoined i with indignation you cannot desire such a thing is it not enough that i am pennyless i have been all night upon the open heath it is now the second day that i have not eaten a morsel of bread would you strip me naked to the weather in the midst of this depopulated forest no no you are men the same hatred of oppression that arms you against the insolence of wealth will teach you to relieve those who are perishing like me for gods sake give me food do not strip me of the comforts i still possess while i uttered this apostrophe the unpremeditated eloquence of sentiment i could perceive by their gestures though the day had not yet begun to dawn that the feelings of one or two of the company appeared to take my part the man who had already undertaken to be their spokesman perceived the same thing and excited either by the brutality of his temper or the love of command hastened to anticipate the disgrace of a defeat he brushed suddenly up to me and by main force pushed me several feet from the place where i stood the shock i received drove me upon a second of the gang not one of those who had listened to my expostulation and he repeated the brutality my indignation was strongly excited by this treatment and after being thrust backward and forward two or three times in this manner i broke through my assailants and turned round to defend myself the first that advanced within my reach was my original enemy in the present moment i listened to nothing but the dictates of passion and i laid him at his length on the earth i was immediately assailed with sticks and bludgeons on all sides and presently received a blow that almost deprived me of my senses the man i had knocked down was now upon his feet again and aimed a stroke at me with a cutlass as i fell which took place in a deep wound upon my neck and shoulder he was going to repeat his blow the two who had seemed to waver at first in their animosity afterwards appeared to me to join in the attack urged either by animal sympathy or the spirit of imitation one of them however as i afterwards understood seized the arm of the man who was going to strike me a second time with his cutlass and who would otherwise probably have put an end to my existence i could hear the words damn it enough enough that is too bad ginesâ€”how so replied a second voice he will but pine here upon the forest and die by inches it will be an act of charity to put him out of his painâ€”it will be imagined that i was not uninterested in this sort of debate i made an effort to speak my voice failed me i stretched out one hand with a gesture of entreaty you shall not strike by god said one of the voices why should we be murderersâ€”the side of forbearance at length prevailed they therefore contented themselves with stripping me of my coat and waistcoat and rolling me into a dry ditch they then left me totally regardless of my distressed condition and the plentiful effusion of blood which streamed from my wound  chapter ii in this woeful situation though extremely weak i was not deprived of sense i tore my shirt from my naked body and endeavoured with some success to make of it a bandage to staunch the flowing of the blood i then exerted myself to crawl up the side of the ditch i had scarcely effected the latter when with equal surprise and joy i perceived a man advancing at no great distance i called for help as well as i could the man came towards me with evident signs of compassion and the appearance i exhibited was indeed sufficiently calculated to excite it i had no hat my hair was dishevelled and the ends of the locks clotted with blood my shirt was wrapped about my neck and shoulders and was plentifully stained with red my body which was naked to my middle was variegated with streams of blood nor had my lower garments which were white by any means escaped for gods sake my good fellow said he with a tone of the greatest imaginable kindness how came you thus and saying this he lifted me up and set me on my feet can you stand added he doubtfully oh yes very well i replied having received this answer he quitted me and began to take off his own coat that he might cover me from the cold i had however overrated my strength and was no sooner left to myself than i reeled and fell almost at my length upon the ground but i broke my fall by stretching out my sound arm and again raised myself upon my knees my benefactor now covered me raised me and bidding me lean upon him told me he would presently conduct me to a place where i should be taken care of courage is a capricious property and though while i had no one to depend upon but myself i possessed a mine of seemingly inexhaustible fortitude yet no sooner did i find this unexpected sympathy on the part of another than my resolution appeared to give way and i felt ready to faint my charitable conductor perceived this and every now and then encouraged me in a manner so cheerful so good humoured and benevolent equally free from the torture of droning expostulation and the weakness of indulgence that i thought myself under the conduct of an angel rather than a man i could perceive that his behaviour had in it nothing of boorishness and that he was thoroughly imbued with the principles of affectionate civility we walked about three quarters of a mile and that not towards the open but the most uncouth and unfrequented part of the forest we crossed a place which had once been a moat but which was now in some parts dry and in others contained a little muddy and stagnated water within the enclosure of this moat i could only discover a pile of ruins and several walls the upper part of which seemed to overhang their foundations and to totter to their ruin after having entered however with my conductor through an archway and passed along a winding passage that was perfectly dark we came to a stand at the upper end of this passage was a door which i was unable to perceive my conductor knocked at the door and was answered by a voice from within which for body and force might have been the voice of a man but with a sort of female sharpness and acidity enquiring who is there satisfaction was no sooner given on this point than i heard two bolts pushed back and the door unlocked the apartment opened and we entered the interior of this habitation by no means corresponded with the appearance of my protector but on the contrary wore the face of discomfort carelessness and dirt the only person i saw within was a woman rather advanced in life and whose person had i know not what of extraordinary and loathsome her eyes were red and bloodshot her hair was pendent in matted and shaggy tresses about her shoulders her complexion swarthy and of the consistency of parchment her form spare and her whole body her arms in particular uncommonly vigorous and muscular not the milk of human kindness but the feverous blood of savage ferocity seemed to flow from her heart and her whole figure suggested an idea of unmitigable energy and an appetite gorged in malevolence this infernal thalestris had no sooner cast her eyes upon us as we entered than she exclaimed in a discordant and discontented voice what have we got here this is not one of our people my conductor without answering this apostrophe bade her push an easy chair which stood in one corner and set it directly before the fire this she did with apparent reluctance murmuring ah you are at your old tricks i wonder what such folks as we have to do with charity it will be the ruin of us at last i can see thatâ€”hold your tongue beldam said he with a stern significance of manner and fetch one of my best shirts a waistcoat and some dressings saying this he at the same time put into her hand a small bunch of keys in a word he treated me with as much kindness as if he had been my father he examined my wound washed and dressed it at the same time that the old woman by his express order prepared for me such nourishment as he thought most suitable to my weak and languid condition these operations were no sooner completed than my benefactor recommended to me to retire to rest and preparations were making for that purpose when suddenly a trampling of feet was heard succeeded by a knock at the door the old woman opened the door with the same precautions as had been employed upon our arrival and immediately six or seven persons tumultuously entered the apartment their appearance was different some having the air of mere rustics and others that of a tarnished sort of gentry all had a feature of boldness inquietude and disorder extremely unlike any thing i had before observed in such a group but my astonishment was still increased when upon a second glance i perceived something in the general air of several of them and of one in particular that persuaded me they were the gang from which i had just escaped and this one the antagonist by whose animosity i was so near having been finally destroyed i imagined they had entered the hovel with a hostile intention that my benefactor was upon the point of being robbed and i probably murdered this suspicion however was soon removed they addressed my conductor with respect under the appellation of captain they were boisterous and noisy in their remarks and exclamations but their turbulence was tempered by a certain deference to his opinion and authority i could observe in the person who had been my active opponent some awkwardness and irresolution as he first perceived me which he dismissed with a sort of effort exclaiming who the devil is here there was something in the tone of this apostrophe that roused the attention of my protector he looked at the speaker with a fixed and penetrating glance and then said nay gines do you know did you ever see the person beforeâ€”curse it gines interrupted a third you are damnably out of luck they say dead men walk and you see there is some truth in itâ€”truce with your impertinence jeckols replied my protector this is no proper occasion for a joke answer me gines were you the cause of this young man being left naked and wounded this bitter morning upon the forest mayhap i was what then what provocation could induce you to so cruel a treatment provocation enough he had no money what did you use him thus without so much as being irritated by any resistance on his part yes he did resist i only hustled him and he had the impudence to strike me gines you are an incorrigible fellow pooh what signifies what i am you with your compassion and your fine feelings will bring us all to the gallows i have nothing to say to you i have no hopes of you comrades it is for you to decide upon the conduct of this man as you think proper you know how repeated his offences have been you know what pains i have taken to mend him our profession is the profession of justice it is thus that the prejudices of men universally teach them to colour the most desperate cause to which they have determined to adhere we who are thieves without a licence are at open war with another set of men who are thieves according to law with such a cause then to bear us out shall we stain it with cruelty malice and revenge a thief is of course a man living among his equals i do not pretend therefore to assume any authority among you act as you think proper but so far as relates to myself i vote that gines be expelled from among us as a disgrace to our society this proposition seemed to meet the general sense it was easy to perceive that the opinion of the rest coincided with that of their leader notwithstanding which a few of them hesitated as to the conduct to be pursued in the mean time gines muttered something in a surly and irresolute way about taking care how they provoked him this insinuation instantly roused the courage of my protector and his eyes flashed with contempt rascal said he do you menace us do you think we will be your slaves no no do your worst go to the next justice of the peace and impeach us i can easily believe you are capable of it sir when we entered into this gang we were not such fools as not to know that we entered upon a service of danger one of its dangers consists in the treachery of fellows like you but we did not enter at first to flinch now did you believe that we would live in hourly fear of you tremble at your threats and compromise whenever you should so please with your insolence that would be a blessed life indeed i would rather see my flesh torn piecemeal from my bones go sir i defy you you dare not do it you dare not sacrifice these gallant fellows to your rage and publish yourself to all the world a traitor and a scoundrel if you do you will punish yourself not us begone the intrepidity of the leader communicated itself to the rest of the company gines easily saw that there was no hope of bringing them over to a contrary sentiment after a short pause he answered i did not meanâ€”no damn it i will not snivel neither i was always true to my principles and a friend to you all but since you are resolved to turn me out whyâ€”good bye to you the expulsion of this man produced a remarkable improvement in the whole gang those who were before inclined to humanity assumed new energy in proportion as they saw such sentiments likely to prevail they had before suffered themselves to be overborne by the boisterous insolence of their antagonist but now they adopted and with success a different conduct those who envied the ascendancy of their comrade and therefore imitated his conduct began to hesitate in their career stories were brought forward of the cruelty and brutality of gines both to men and animals which had never before reached the ear of the leader the stories i shall not repeat they could excite only emotions of abhorrence and disgust and some of them argued a mind of such a stretch of depravity as to many readers would appear utterly incredible and yet this man had his virtues he was enterprising persevering and faithful his removal was a considerable benefit to me it would have been no small hardship to have been turned adrift immediately under my unfavourable circumstances with the additional disadvantage of the wound i had received and yet i could scarcely have ventured to remain under the same roof with a man to whom my appearance was as a guilty conscience perpetually reminding him of his own offence and the displeasure of his leader his profession accustomed him to a certain degree of indifference to consequences and indulgence to the sallies of passion and he might easily have found his opportunity to insult or injure me when i should have had nothing but my own debilitated exertions to protect me freed from this danger i found my situation sufficiently fortunate for a man under my circumstances it was attended with all the advantages for concealment my fondest imagination could have hoped and it was by no means destitute of the benefits which arise from kindness and humanity nothing could be more unlike than the thieves i had seen in  jail and the thieves of my new residence the latter were generally full of cheerfulness and merriment they could expatiate freely wherever they thought proper they could form plans and execute them they consulted their inclinations they did not impose upon themselves the task as is too often the case in human society of seeming tacitly to approve that from which they suffered most or which is worst of persuading themselves that all the wrongs they suffered were right but were at open war with their oppressors on the contrary the imprisoned felons i had lately seen were shut up like wild beasts in a cage deprived of activity and palsied with indolence the occasional demonstrations that still remained of their former enterprising life were the starts and convulsions of disease not the meditated and consistent exertions of a mind in health they had no more of hope of project of golden and animated dreams but were reserved to the most dismal prospects and forbidden to think upon any other topic it is true that these two scenes were parts of one whole the one the consummation the hourly to be expected successor of the other but the men i now saw were wholly inattentive to this and in that respect appeared to hold no commerce with reflection or reason i might in one view as i have said congratulate myself upon my present residence it answered completely the purposes of concealment it was the seat of merriment and hilarity but the hilarity that characterised it produced no correspondent feelings in my bosom the persons who composed this society had each of them cast off all control from established principle their trade was terror and their constant object to elude the vigilance of the community the influence of these circumstances was visible in their character i found among them benevolence and kindness they were strongly susceptible of emotions of generosity but as their situation was precarious their dispositions were proportionably fluctuating inured to the animosity of their species they were irritable and passionate accustomed to exercise harshness towards the subject of their depredations they did not always confine their brutality within that scope they were habituated to consider wounds and bludgeons and stabbing as the obvious mode of surmounting every difficulty uninvolved in the debilitating routine of human affairs they frequently displayed an energy which from every impartial observer would have extorted veneration energy is perhaps of all qualities the most valuable and a just political system would possess the means of extracting from it thus circumstanced its beneficial qualities instead of consigning it as now to indiscriminate destruction we act like the chemist who should reject the finest ore and employ none but what was sufficiently debased to fit it immediately for the vilest uses but the energy of these men such as i beheld it was in the highest degree misapplied unassisted by liberal and enlightened views and directed only to the most narrow and contemptible purposes the residence i have been describing might to many persons have appeared attended with intolerable inconveniences but exclusively of its advantages as a field for speculation it was elysium compared with that from which i had just escaped displeasing company incommodious apartments filthiness and riot lost the circumstance by which they could most effectually disgust when i was not compelled to remain with them all hardships i could patiently endure in comparison with the menace of a violent and untimely death there was no suffering that i could not persuade myself to consider as trivial except that which flowed from the tyranny the frigid precaution or the inhuman revenge of my own species my recovery advanced in the most favourable manner the attention and kindness of my protector were incessant and the rest caught the spirit from his example the old woman who superintended the household still retained her animosity she considered me as the cause of the expulsion of gines from the fraternity gines had been the object of her particular partiality and zealous as she was for the public concern she thought an old and experienced sinner for a raw probationer but an ill exchange add to which that her habits inclined her to moroseness and discontent and that persons of her complexion seem unable to exist without some object upon which to pour out the superfluity of their gall she lost no opportunity upon the most trifling occasion of displaying her animosity and ever and anon eyed me with a furious glance of canine hunger for my destruction nothing was more evidently mortifying to her than the procrastination of her malice nor could she bear to think that a fierceness so gigantic and uncontrollable should show itself in nothing more terrific than the pigmy spite of a chambermaid for myself i had been accustomed to the warfare of formidable adversaries and the encounter of alarming dangers and what i saw of her spleen had not power sufficient to disturb my tranquillity as i recovered i told my story except so far as related to the detection of mr falklands eventful secret to my protector that particular i could not as yet prevail upon myself to disclose even in a situation like this which seemed to preclude the possibility of its being made use of to the disadvantage of my persecutor my present auditor however whose habits of thinking were extremely opposite to those of mr forester did not from the obscurity which flowed from this reserve deduce any unfavourable conclusion his penetration was such as to afford little room for an impostor to hope to mislead him by a fictitious statement and he confided in that penetration so confiding the simplicity and integrity of my manner carried conviction to his mind and insured his good opinion and friendship he listened to my story with eagerness and commented on the several parts as i related them he said that this was only one fresh instance of the tyranny and perfidiousness exercised by the powerful members of the community against those who were less privileged than themselves nothing could be more clear than their readiness to sacrifice the human species at large to their meanest interest or wildest caprice who that saw the situation in its true light would wait till their oppressors thought fit to decree their destruction and not take arms in their defence while it was yet in their power which was most meritorious the unresisting and dastardly submission of a slave or the enterprise and gallantry of the man who dared to assert his claims since by the partial administration of our laws innocence when power was armed against it had nothing better to hope for than guilt what man of true courage would fail to set these laws at defiance and if he must suffer by their injustice at least take care that he had first shown his contempt of their yoke for himself he should certainly never have embraced his present calling had he not been stimulated to it by these cogent and irresistible reasons and he hoped as experience had so forcibly brought a conviction of this sort to my mind that he should for the future have the happiness to associate me to his pursuitsâ€”it will presently be seen with what event these hopes were attended numerous were the precautions exercised by the gang of thieves with whom i now resided to elude the vigilance of the satellites of justice it was one of their rules to commit no depredations but at a considerable distance from the place of their residence and gines had transgressed this regulation in the attack to which i was indebted for my present asylum after having possessed themselves of any booty they took care in the sight of the persons whom they had robbed to pursue a route as nearly as possible opposite to that which led to their true haunts the appearance of their place of residence together with its environs was peculiarly desolate and forlorn and it had the reputation of being haunted the old woman i have described had long been its inhabitant and was commonly supposed to be its only inhabitant and her person well accorded with the rural ideas of a witch her lodgers never went out or came in but with the utmost circumspection and generally by night the lights which were occasionally seen from various parts of her habitation were by the country people regarded with horror as supernatural and if the noise of revelry at any time saluted their ears it was imagined to proceed from a carnival of devils with all these advantages the thieves did not venture to reside here but by intervals they frequently absented themselves for months and removed to a different part of the country the old woman sometimes attended them in these transportations and sometimes remained but in all cases her decampment took place either sooner or later than theirs so that the nicest observer could scarcely have traced any connection between her reappearance and the alarms of depredation that were frequently given and the festival of demons seemed to the terrified rustics indifferently to take place whether she were present or absent  chapter iii one day while i continued in this situation a circumstance occurred which involuntarily attracted my attention two of our people had been sent to a town at some distance for the purpose of procuring us the things of which we were in want after having delivered these to our landlady they retired to one corner of the room and one of them pulling a printed paper from his pocket they mutually occupied themselves in examining its contents i was sitting in an easy chair by the fire being considerably better than i had been though still in a weak and languid state having read for a considerable time they looked at me and then at the paper and then at me again they then went out of the room together as if to consult without interruption upon something which that paper suggested to them some time after they returned and my protector who had been absent upon the former occasion entered the room at the same instant captain said one of them with an air of pleasure look here we have found a prize i believe it is as good as a banknote of a hundred guineas mr raymond that was his name took the paper and read he paused for a moment he then crushed the paper in his hand and turning to the person from whom he had received it said with the tone of a man confident in the success of his reasonsâ€” what use have you for these hundred guineas are you in want are you in distress can you be contented to purchase them at the price of treacheryâ€”of violating the laws of hospitality faith captain i do not very well know after having violated other laws i do not see why we should be frightened at an old saw we pretend to judge for ourselves and ought to be above shrinking from a bugbear of a proverb beside this is a good deed and i should think no more harm of being the ruin of such a thief than of getting my dinner a thief you talk of thieves not so fast captain god defend that i should say a word against thieving as a general occupation but one man steals in one way and another in another for my part i go upon the highway and take from any stranger i meet what it is a hundred to one he can very well spare i see nothing to be found fault with in that but i have as much conscience as another man because i laugh at assizes and great wigs and the gallows and because i will not be frightened from an innocent action when the lawyers say me nay does it follow that i am to have a fellowfeeling for pilferers and rascally servants and people that have neither justice nor principle no i have too much respect for the trade not to be a foe to interlopers and people that so much the more deserve my hatred because the world calls them by my name you are wrong larkins you certainly ought not to employ against people that you hate supposing your hatred to be reasonable the instrumentality of that law which in your practice you defy be consistent either be the friend of the law or its adversary depend upon it that wherever there are laws at all there will be laws against such people as you and me either therefore we all of us deserve the vengeance of the law or law is not the proper instrument for correcting the misdeeds of mankind i tell you this because i would fain have you aware that an informer or a kings evidence a man who takes advantage of the confidence of another in order to betray him who sells the life of his neighbour for money or cowardlike upon any pretence calls in the law to do that for him which he cannot or dares not do for himself is the vilest of rascals but in the present case if your reasons were the best in the world they do not apply while mr raymond was speaking the rest of the gang came into the room he immediately turned to them and saidâ€” my friends here is a piece of intelligence that larkins has just brought in which with his leave i will lay before you then unfolding the paper he had received he continued this is the description of a felon with the offer of a hundred guineas for his apprehension larking picked it up at  by the time and other circumstances but particularly by the minute description of his person there can be no doubt but the object of it is our young friend whose life i was a while ago the instrument of saving he is charged here with having taken advantage of the confidence of his patron and benefactor to rob him of property to a large amount upon this charge he was committed to the county jail from whence he made his escape about a fortnight ago without venturing to stand his trial a circumstance which is stated by the advertiser as tantamount to a confession of his guilt my friends i was acquainted with the particulars of this story some time before this lad let me into his history at a time that he could not possibly foresee that he should stand in need of that precaution as an antidote against danger he is not guilty of what is laid to his charge which of you is so ignorant as to suppose that his escape is any confirmation of his guilt who ever thinks when he is apprehended for trial of his innocence or guilt as being at all material to the issue who ever was fool enough to volunteer a trial where those who are to decide think more of the horror of the thing of which he is accused than whether he were the person that did it and where the nature of our motives is to be collected from a set of ignorant witnesses that no wise man would trust for a fair representation of the most indifferent action of his life the poor lads story is a long one and i will not trouble you with it now but from that story it is as clear as the day that because he wished to leave the service of his master because he had been perhaps a little too inquisitive in his masters concerns and because as i suspect he had been trusted with some important secrets his master conceived an antipathy against him the antipathy gradually proceeded to such a length as to induce the master to forge this vile accusation he seemed willing to hang the lad out of the way rather than suffer him to go where he pleased or get beyond the reach of his power williams has told me the story with such ingenuousness that i am as sure that he is guiltless of what they lay to his charge as that i am so myself nevertheless the mans servants who were called in to hear the accusation and his relation who as justice of the peace made out the mittimus and who had the folly to think he could be impartial gave it on his side with one voice and thus afforded williams a sample of what he had to expect in the sequel larkins who when he received this paper had no previous knowledge of particulars was for taking advantage of it for the purpose of earning the hundred guineas are you of that mind now you have heard them will you for so paltry a consideration deliver up the lamb into the jaws of the wolf will you abet the purposes of this sanguinary rascal who not contented with driving his late dependent from house and home depriving him of character and all the ordinary means of subsistence and leaving him almost without a refuge still thirsts for his blood if no other person have the courage to set limits to the tyranny of courts of justice shall not we shall we who earn our livelihood by generous daring be indebted for a penny to the vile artifices of the informer shall we against whom the whole species is in arms refuse our protection to an individual more exposed to but still less deserving of their persecution than ourselves the representation of the captain produced an instant effect upon the whole company they all exclaimed betray him no not for worlds he is safe we will protect him at the hazard of our lives if fidelity and honour be banished from thieves where shall they find refuge upon the face of the earth  larkins in particular thanked the captain for his interference and swore that he would rather part with his right hand than injure so worthy a lad or assist such an unheardof villainy saying this he took me by the hand and bade me fear nothing under their roof no harm should ever befal me and even if the understrappers of the law should discover my retreat they would to a man die in my defence sooner than a hair of my head should be hurt i thanked him most sincerely for his goodwill but i was principally struck with the fervent benevolence of my benefactor i told them i found that my enemies were inexorable and would never be appeased but with my blood and i assured them with the most solemn and earnest veracity that i had done nothing to deserve the persecution which was exercised against me the spirit and energy of mr raymond had been such as to leave no part for me to perform in repelling this unlookedfor danger nevertheless it left a very serious impression upon my mind i had always placed some confidence in the returning equity of mr falkland though he persecuted me with bitterness i could not help believing that he did it unwillingly and i was persuaded it would not be for ever a man whose original principles had been so full of rectitude and honour could not fail at some time to recollect the injustice of his conduct and to remit his asperity this idea had been always present to me and had in no small degree conspired to instigate my exertions i said i will convince my persecutor that i am of more value than that i should be sacrificed purely by way of precaution these expectations on my part had been encouraged by mr falklands behaviour upon the question of my imprisonment and by various particulars which had occurred since but this new incident gave the subject a totally different appearance i saw him not contented with blasting my reputation confining me for a period in jail and reducing me to the situation of a houseless vagabond still continuing his pursuit under these forlorn circumstances with unmitigable cruelty indignation and resentment seemed now for the first time to penetrate my mind i knew his misery so well i was so fully acquainted with its cause and strongly impressed with the idea of its being unmerited that while i suffered deeply i still continued to pity rather than hate my persecutor but this incident introduced some change into my feelings i said surely he might now believe that he had sufficiently disarmed me and might at length suffer me to be at peace at least ought he not to be contented to leave me to my fate the perilous and uncertain condition of an escaped felon instead of thus whetting the animosity and vigilance of my countrymen against me were his interference on my behalf in opposition to the stern severity of mr forester and his various acts of kindness since a mere part that he played in order to lull me into patience was he perpetually haunted with the fear of an ample retaliation and for that purpose did he personate remorse at the very moment that he was secretly keeping every engine at play that could secure my destruction the very suspicion of such a fact filled me with inexpressible horror and struck a sudden chill through every fibre of my frame my wound was by this time completely healed and it became absolutely necessary that i should form some determination respecting the future my habits of thinking were such as gave me an uncontrollable repugnance to the vocation of my hosts i did not indeed feel that aversion and abhorrence to the men which are commonly entertained i saw and respected their good qualities and their virtues i was by no means inclined to believe them worse men or more hostile in their dispositions to the welfare of their species than the generality of those that look down upon them with most censure but though i did not cease to love them as individuals my eyes were perfectly open to their mistakes if i should otherwise have been in danger of being misled it was my fortune to have studied felons in a jail before i studied them in their state of comparative prosperity and this was an infallible antidote to the poison i saw that in this profession were exerted uncommon energy ingenuity and fortitude and i could not help recollecting how admirably beneficial such qualities might be made in the great theatre of human affairs while in their present direction they were thrown away upon purposes diametrically at war with the first interests of human society nor were their proceedings less injurious to their own interest than incompatible with the general welfare the man who risks or sacrifices his life for the public cause is rewarded with the testimony of an approving conscience but persons who wantonly defy the necessary though atrociously exaggerated precautions of government in the matter of property at the same time that they commit an alarming hostility against the whole are as to their own concerns scarcely less absurd and selfneglectful than the man who should set himself up as a mark for a file of musqueteers to shoot at viewing the subject in this light i not only determined that i would have no share in their occupation myself but thought i could not do less in return for the benefits i had received from them than endeavour to dissuade them from an employment in which they must themselves be the greatest sufferers my expostulation met with a various reception all the persons to whom it was addressed had been tolerably successful in persuading themselves of the innocence of their calling and what remained of doubt in their mind was smothered and so to speak laboriously forgotten some of them laughed at my arguments as a ridiculous piece of missionary quixotism others and particularly our captain repelled them with the boldness of a man that knows he has got the strongest side but this sentiment of ease and selfsatisfaction did not long remain they had been used to arguments derived from religion and the sacredness of law they had long ago shaken these from them as so many prejudices but my view of the subject appealed to principles which they could not contest and had by no means the air of that customary reproof which is for ever dinned in our ears without finding one responsive chord in our hearts urged as they now were with objections unexpected and cogent some of those to whom i addressed them began to grow peevish and impatient of the intrusive remonstrance but this was by no means the case with mr raymond he was possessed of a candour that i have seldom seen equalled he was surprised to hear objections so powerful to that which as a matter of speculation he believed he had examined on all sides he revolved them with impartiality and care he admitted them slowly but he at length fully admitted them he had now but one rejoinder in reserve alas williams said he it would have been fortunate for me if these views had been presented to me previously to my embracing my present profession it is now too late those very laws which by a perception of their iniquity drove me to what i am preclude my return god we are told judges of men by what they are at the period of arraignment and whatever be their crimes if they have seen and abjured the folly of those crimes receives them to favour but the institutions of countries that profess to worship this god admit no such distinctions they leave no room for amendment and seem to have a brutal delight in confounding the demerits of offenders it signifies not what is the character of the individual at the hour of trial how changed how spotless and how useful avails him nothing if they discover at the distance of fourteen  or of forty years  an action for which the law ordains that his life shall be the forfeit though the interval should have been spent with the purity of a saint and the devotedness of a patriot they disdain to enquire into it what then can i do am i not compelled to go on in folly having once begun  chapter iv i was extremely affected by this plea i could only answer that mr raymond must himself be the best judge of the course it became him to hold i trusted the case was not so desperate as he imagined this subject was pursued no further and was in some degree driven from my thoughts by an incident of a very extraordinary nature i have already mentioned the animosity that was entertained against me by the infernal portress of this solitary mansion gines the expelled member of the gang had been her particular favourite she submitted to his exile indeed because her genius felt subdued by the energy and inherent superiority of mr raymond but she submitted with murmuring and discontent not daring to resent the conduct of the principal in this affair she collected all the bitterness of her spirit against me to the unpardonable offence i had thus committed in the first instance were added the reasonings i had lately offered against the profession of robbery robbery was a fundamental article in the creed of this hoary veteran and she listened to my objections with the same unaffected astonishment and horror that an old woman of other habits would listen to one who objected to the agonies and dissolution of the creator of the world or to the garment of imputed righteousness prepared to envelope the souls of the elect like the religious bigot she was sufficiently disposed to avenge a hostility against her opinions with the weapons of sublunary warfare meanwhile i had smiled at the impotence of her malice as an object of contempt rather than alarm she perceived as i imagine the slight estimation in which i held her and this did not a little increase the perturbation of her thoughts one day i was left alone with no other person in the house than this swarthy sybil the thieves had set out upon an expedition about two hours after sunset on the preceding evening and had not returned as they were accustomed to do before daybreak the next morning this was a circumstance that sometimes occurred and therefore did not produce any extraordinary alarm at one time the scent of prey would lead them beyond the bounds they had prescribed themselves and at another the fear of pursuit the life of a thief is always uncertain the old woman had been preparing during the night for the meal to which they would expect to sit down as soon as might be after their return for myself i had learned from their habits to be indifferent to the regular return of the different parts of the day and in some degree to turn day into night and night into day i had been now several weeks in this residence and the season was considerably advanced i had passed some hours during the night in ruminating on my situation the character and manners of the men among whom i lived were disgusting to me their brutal ignorance their ferocious habits and their coarse behaviour instead of becoming more tolerable by custom hourly added force to my original aversion the uncommon vigour of their minds and acuteness of their invention in the business they pursued compared with the odiousness of that business and their habitual depravity awakened in me sensations too painful to be endured moral disapprobation at least in a mind unsubdued by philosophy i found to be one of the most fertile sources of disquiet and uneasiness from this pain the society of mr raymond by no means relieved me he was indeed eminently superior to the vices of the rest but i did not less exquisitely feel how much he was out of his place how disproportionably associated or how contemptibly employed i had attempted to counteract the errors under which he and his companions laboured but i had found the obstacles that presented themselves greater than i had imagined what was i to do was i to wait the issue of this my missionary undertaking or was i to withdraw myself immediately when i withdrew ought that to be done privately or with an open avowal of my design and an endeavour to supply by the force of example what was deficient in my arguments it was certainly improper as i declined all participation in the pursuits of these men did not pay my contribution of hazard to the means by which they subsisted and had no congeniality with their habits that i should continue to reside with them longer than was absolutely necessary there was one circumstance that rendered this deliberation particularly pressing they intended in a few days removing from their present habitation to a haunt to which they were accustomed in a distant county if i did not propose to continue with them it would perhaps be wrong to accompany them in this removal the state of calamity to which my inexorable prosecutor had reduced me had made the encounter even of a den of robbers a fortunate adventure but the time that had since elapsed had probably been sufficient to relax the keenness of the quest that was made after me i sighed for that solitude and obscurity that retreat from the vexations of the world and the voice even of common fame which i had proposed to myself when i broke my prison such were the meditations which now occupied my mind at length i grew fatigued with continual contemplation and to relieve myself pulled out a pocket horace the legacy of my beloved brightwel i read with avidity the epistle in which he so beautifully describes to fuscus the grammarian the pleasures of rural tranquillity and independence by this time the sun rose from behind the eastern hills and i opened my casement to contemplate it the day commenced with peculiar brilliancy and was accompanied with all those charms which the poets of nature as they have been styled have so much delighted to describe there was something in this scene particularly as succeeding to the active exertions of intellect that soothed the mind to composure insensibly a confused reverie invaded my faculties i withdrew from the window threw myself upon the bed and fell asleep i do not recollect the precise images which in this situation passed through my thoughts but i know that they concluded with the idea of some person the agent of mr falkland approaching to assassinate me this thought had probably been suggested by the project i meditated of entering once again into the world and throwing myself within the sphere of his possible vengeance i imagined that the design of the murderer was to come upon me by surprise that i was aware of his design and yet by some fascination had no thought of evading it i heard the steps of the murderer as he cautiously approached i seemed to listen to his constrained yet audible breathings he came up to the corner where i was placed and then stopped the idea became too terrible i started opened my eyes and beheld the execrable hag before mentioned standing over me with a butchers cleaver i shifted my situation with a speed that seemed too swift for volition and the blow already aimed at my skull sunk impotent upon the bed before she could wholly recover her posture i sprung upon her seized hold of the weapon and had nearly wrested it from her but in a moment she resumed her strength and her desperate purpose and we had a furious struggleâ€”she impelled by inveterate malice and i resisting for my life her vigour was truly amazonian and at no time had i ever occasion to contend with a more formidable opponent her glance was rapid and exact and the shock with which from time to time she impelled her whole frame inconceivably vehement at length i was victorious took from her the instrument of death and threw her upon the ground till now the earnestness of her exertions had curbed her rage but now she gnashed with her teeth her eyes seemed as if starting from their sockets and her body heaved with uncontrollable insanity rascal devil she exclaimed what do you mean to do to me till now the scene had passed uninterrupted by a single word nothing i replied begone infernal witch and leave me to myself leave you no i will thrust my fingers through your ribs and drink your bloodyou conquer meâ€”ha hayes yes you shalli will sit upon you and press you to hell i will roast you with brimstone and dash your entrails into your eyes ha haha saying this she sprung up and prepared to attack me with redoubled fury i seized her hands and compelled her to sit upon the bed thus restrained she continued to express the tumult of her thoughts by grinning by certain furious motions of her head and by occasional vehement efforts to disengage herself from my grasp these contortions and starts were of the nature of those fits in which the patients are commonly supposed to need three or four persons to hold them but i found by experience that under the circumstances in which i was placed my single strength was sufficient the spectacle of her emotions was inconceivably frightful her violence at length however began to abate and she became convinced of the hopelessness of the contest let me go said she why do you hold me i will not be held i wanted you gone from the first replied i are you contented to go now yes i tell you misbegotten villain yes rascal i immediately loosed my hold she flew to the door and holding it in her hand said i will be the death of you yet you shall not be your own man twentyfour hours longer with these words she shut the door and locked it upon me an action so totally unexpected startled me whither was she gone what was it she intended to perish by the machinations of such a hag as this was a thought not to be endured death in any form brought upon us by surprise and for which the mind has had no time to prepare is inexpressibly terrible my thoughts wandered in breathless horror and confusion and all within was uproar i endeavoured to break the door but in vain i went round the room in search of some tool to assist me at length i rushed against it with a desperate effort to which it yielded and had nearly thrown me from the top of the stairs to the bottom i descended with all possible caution and vigilance i entered the room which served us for a kitchen but it was deserted i searched every other apartment in vain i went out among the ruins still i discovered nothing of my late assailant it was extraordinary what could be become of her what was i to conclude from her disappearance i reflected on her parting menaceâ€”i should not be my own man twentyfour hours longer it was mysterious it did not seem to be the menace of assassination suddenly the recollection of the handbill brought to us by larkins rushed upon my memory was it possible that she alluded to that in her parting words would she set out upon such an expedition by herself was it not dangerous to the whole fraternity if without the smallest precaution she should bring the officers of justice in the midst of them it was perhaps improbable she would engage in an undertaking thus desperate it was not however easy to answer for the conduct of a person in her state of mind should i wait and risk the preservation of my liberty upon the issue to this question i returned an immediate negative i had resolved in a short time to quit my present situation and the difference of a little sooner or a little later could not be very material it promised to be neither agreeable nor prudent for me to remain under the same roof with a person who had manifested such a fierce and inexpiable hostility but the consideration which had inexpressibly the most weight with me belonged to the ideas of imprisonment trial and death the longer they had formed the subject of my contemplation the more forcibly was i impelled to avoid them i had entered upon a system of action for that purpose i had already made many sacrifices and i believed that i would never miscarry in this project through any neglect of mine the thought of what was reserved for me by my persecutors sickened my very soul and the more intimately i was acquainted with oppression and injustice the more deeply was i penetrated with the abhorrence to which they are entitled such were the reasons that determined me instantly abruptly without leavetaking or acknowledgment for the peculiar and repeated favours i had received to quit a habitation to which for six weeks i had apparently been indebted for protection from trial conviction and an ignominious death i had come hither pennyless i quitted my abode with the sum of a few guineas in my possession mr raymond having insisted upon my taking a share at the time that each man received his dividend from the common stock though i had reason to suppose that the heat of the pursuit against me would be somewhat remitted by the time that had elapsed the magnitude of the mischief that in an unfavourable event might fall on me determined me to neglect no imaginable precaution i recollected the handbill which was the source of my present alarm and conceived that one of the principal dangers which threatened me was the recognition of my person either by such as had previously known me or even by strangers it seemed prudent therefore to disguise it as effectually as i could for this purpose i had recourse to a parcel of tattered garments that lay in a neglected corner of our habitation the disguise i chose was that of a beggar upon this plan i threw off my shirt i tied a handkerchief about my head with which i took care to cover one of my eyes over this i drew a piece of an old woollen nightcap i selected the worst apparel i could find and this i reduced to a still more deplorable condition by rents that i purposely made in various places thus equipped i surveyed myself in a lookingglass i had rendered my appearance complete nor would any one have suspected that i was not one of the fraternity to which i assumed to belong i said this is the form in which tyranny and injustice oblige me to seek for refuge but better a thousand times better is it thus to incur contempt with the dregs of mankind than trust to the tender mercies of our superiors  chapter v the only rule that i laid down to myself in traversing the forest was to take a direction as opposite as possible to that which led to the scene of my late imprisonment after about two hours walking i arrived at the termination of this ruder scene and reached that part of the country which is inclosed and cultivated here i sat down by the side of a brook and pulling out a crust of bread which i had brought away with me rested and refreshed myself while i continued in this place i began to ruminate upon the plan i should lay down for my future proceedings and my propensity now led me as it had done in a former instance to fix upon the capital which i believed besides its other recommendations would prove the safest place for concealment during these thoughts i saw a couple of peasants passing at a small distance and enquired of them respecting the london road by their description i understood that the most immediate way would be to repass a part of the forest and that it would be necessary to approach considerably nearer to the countytown than i was at the spot which i had at present reached i did not imagine that this could be a circumstance of considerable importance my disguise appeared to be a sufficient security against momentary danger and i therefore took a path though not the most direct one which led towards the point they suggested some of the occurrences of the day are deserving to be mentioned as i passed along a road which lay in my way for a few miles i saw a carriage advancing in the opposite direction i debated with myself for a moment whether i should pass it without notice or should take this occasion by voice or gesture of making an essay of my trade this idle disquisition was however speedily driven from my mind when i perceived that the carriage was mr falklands the suddenness of the encounter struck me with terror though perhaps it would have been difficult for calm reflection to have discovered any considerable danger i withdrew from the road and skulked behind a hedge till it should have completely gone by i was too much occupied with my own feelings to venture to examine whether or no the terrible adversary of my peace were in the carriage i persuaded myself that he was i looked after the equipage and exclaimed there you may see the luxurious accommodations and appendages of guilt and here the forlornness that awaits upon innocenceâ€”i was to blame to imagine that my case was singular in that respect i only mention it to show how the most trivial circumstance contributes to embitter the cup to the man of adversity the thought however was a transient one i had learned this lesson from my sufferings not to indulge in the luxury of discontent as my mind recovered its tranquillity i began to enquire whether the phenomenon i had just seen could have any relation to myself but though my mind was extremely inquisitive and versatile in this respect i could discover no sufficient ground upon which to build a judgment at night i entered a little publichouse at the extremity of a village and seating myself in a corner of the kitchen asked for some bread and cheese while i was sitting at my repast three or four labourers came in for a little refreshment after their work ideas respecting the inequality of rank pervade every order in society and as my appearance was meaner and more contemptible than theirs i found it expedient to give way to these gentry of a village alehouse and remove to an obscurer station i was surprised and not a little startled to find them fall almost immediately into conversation about my history whom with a slight variation of circumstances they styled the notorious housebreaker kit williams damn the fellow said one of them one never hears of any thing else o my life i think he makes talk for the whole country that is very true replied another i was at the markettown today to sell some oats for my master and there was a hue and cry some of them thought they had got him but it was a false alarm that hundred guineas is a fine thing rejoined the first i should be glad if so be as how it fell in my way for the matter of that said his companion i should like a hundred guineas as well as another but i cannot be of your mind for all that i should never think money would do me any good that had been the means of bringing a christian creature to the gallows poh that is all my granny some folks must be hanged to keep the wheels of our statefolks agoing besides i could forgive the fellow all his other robberies but that he should have been so hardened as to break the house of his own master at last that is too bad lord lord replied the other i see you know nothing of the matter i will tell you how it was as i learned it at the town i question whether he ever robbed his master at all but hark you you must know as how that squire falkland was once tried for murderâ€” yes yes we know that well he was as innocent as the child unborn but i supposes as how he is a little soft or so and so kit williamsâ€”kit is a devilish cunning fellow you may judge that from his breaking prison no less than five timesâ€”so i say he threatened to bring his master to trial at size all over again and so frightened him and got money from him at divers times till at last one squire forester a relation of tother found it all out and he made the hell of a rumpus and sent away kit to prison in a twinky and i believe he would have been hanged for when two squires lay their heads together they do not much matter law you know or else they twist the law to their own ends i cannot exactly say which but it is much at one when the poor fellows breath is out of his body though this story was very circumstantially told and with a sufficient detail of particulars it did not pass unquestioned each man maintained the justness of his own statement and the dispute was long and obstinately pursued historians and commentators at length withdrew together the terrors with which i was seized when this conversation began were extreme i stole a sidelong glance to one quarter and another to observe if any mans attention was turned upon me i trembled as if in an aguefit and at first felt continual impulses to quit the house and take to my heels i drew closer to my corner held aside my head and seemed from time to time to undergo a total revolution of the animal economy at length the tide of ideas turned perceiving they paid no attention to me the recollection of the full security my disguise afforded recurred strongly to my thoughts and i began inwardly to exult though i did not venture to obtrude myself to examination by degrees i began to be amused at the absurdity of their tales and the variety of the falsehoods i heard asserted around me my soul seemed to expand i felt a pride in the selfpossession and lightness of heart with which i could listen to the scene and i determined to prolong and heighten the enjoyment accordingly when they were withdrawn i addressed myself to our hostess a buxom bluff goodhumoured widow and asked what sort of a man this kit williams might be she replied that as she was informed he was as handsome likely a lad as any in four counties round and that she loved him for his cleverness by which he outwitted all the keepers they could set over him and made his way through stone walls as if they were so many cobwebs i observed that the country was so thoroughly alarmed that i did not think it possible he should escape the pursuit that was set up after him this idea excited her immediate indignation she said she hoped he was far enough away by this time but if not she wished the curse of god might light on them that betrayed so noble a fellow to an ignominious endthough she little thought that the person of whom she spoke was so near her yet the sincere and generous warmth with which she interested herself in my behalf gave me considerable pleasure with this sensation to sweeten the fatigues of the day and the calamities of my situation i retired from the kitchen to a neighbouring barn laid myself down upon some straw and fell into a profound sleep the next day about noon as i was pursuing my journey i was overtaken by two men on horseback who stopped me to enquire respecting a person that they supposed might have passed along that road as they proceeded in their description i perceived with astonishment and terror that i was myself the person to whom their questions related they entered into a tolerably accurate detail of the various characteristics by which my person might best be distinguished they said they had good reason to believe that i had been seen at a place in that county the very day before while they were speaking a third person who had fallen behind came up and my alarm was greatly increased upon seeing that this person was the servant of mr forester who had visited me in prison about a fortnight before my escape my best resource in this crisis was composure and apparent indifference it was fortunate for me that my disguise was so complete that the eye of mr falkland itself could scarcely have penetrated it i had been aware for some time before that this was a refuge which events might make necessary and had endeavoured to arrange and methodise my ideas upon the subject from my youth i had possessed a considerable facility in the art of imitation and when i quitted my retreat in the habitation of mr raymond i adopted along with my beggars attire a peculiar slouching and clownish gait to be used whenever there should appear the least chance of my being observed together with an irish brogue which i had had an opportunity of studying in my prison such are the miserable expedients and so great the studied artifice which man who never deserves the name of manhood but in proportion as he is erect and independent may find it necessary to employ for the purpose of eluding the inexorable animosity and unfeeling tyranny of his fellow man i had made use of this brogue though i have not thought it necessary to write it down in my narrative in the conversation of the village alehouse mr foresters servant as he came up observed that his companions were engaged in conversation with me and guessing at the subject asked whether they had gained any intelligence he added to the information at which they had already hinted that a resolution was taken to spare neither diligence nor expense for my discovery and apprehension and that they were satisfied if i were above ground and in the kingdom it would be impossible for me to escape them every new incident that had occurred to me tended to impress upon my mind the extreme danger to which i was exposed i could almost have imagined that i was the sole subject of general attention and that the whole world was in arms to exterminate me the very idea tingled through every fibre of my frame but terrible as it appeared to my imagination it did but give new energy to my purpose and i determined that i would not voluntarily resign the field that is literally speaking my neck to the cord of the executioner notwithstanding the greatest superiority in my assailants but the incidents which had befallen me though they did not change my purpose induced me to examine over again the means by which it might be effected the consequence of this revisal was to determine me to bend my course to the nearest seaport on the west side of the island and transport myself to ireland i cannot now tell what it was that inclined me to prefer this scheme to that which i had originally formed perhaps the latter which had been for some time present to my imagination for that reason appeared the more obvious of the two and i found an appearance of complexity which the mind did not stay to explain in substituting the other in its stead i arrived without further impediment at the place from which i intended to sail enquired for a vessel which i found ready to put to sea in a few hours and agreed with the captain for my passage ireland had to me the disadvantage of being a dependency of the british government and therefore a place of less security than most other countries which are divided from it by the ocean to judge from the diligence with which i seemed to be pursued in england it was not improbable that the zeal of my persecutors might follow me to the other side of the channel it was however sufficiently agreeable to my mind that i was upon the point of being removed one step further from the danger which was so grievous to my imagination could there be any peril in the short interval that was to elapse before the vessel was to weigh anchor and quit the english shore probably not a very short time had intervened between my determination for the sea and my arrival at this place and if any new alarm had been given to my prosecutors it proceeded from the old woman a very few days before i hoped i had anticipated their diligence meanwhile that i might neglect no reasonable precaution i went instantly on board resolved that i would not unnecessarily by walking the streets of the town expose myself to any untoward accident this was the first time i had upon any occasion taken leave of my native country  chapter vi the time was now nearly elapsed that was prescribed for our stay and orders for weighing anchor were every moment expected when we were hailed by a boat from the shore with two other men in it besides those that rowed they entered our vessel in an instant they were officers of justice the passengers five persons besides myself were ordered upon deck for examination i was inexpressibly disturbed at the occurrence of such a circumstance in so unseasonable a moment i took it for granted that it was of me they were in search was it possible that by any unaccountable accident they should have got an intimation of my disguise it was infinitely more distressing to encounter them upon this narrow stage and under these pointed circumstances than as i had before encountered my pursuers under the appearance of an indifferent person my recollection however did not forsake me i confided in my conscious disguise and my irish brogue as a rock of dependence against all accidents no sooner did we appear upon deck than to my great consternation i could observe the attention of our guests principally turned upon me they asked a few frivolous questions of such of my fellow passengers as happened to be nearest to them and then turning to me enquired my name who i was whence i came and what had brought me there i had scarcely opened my mouth to reply when with one consent they laid hold of me said i was their prisoner and declared that my accent together with the correspondence of my person would be sufficient to convict me before any court in england i was hurried out of the vessel into the boat in which they came and seated between them as if by way of precaution lest i should spring overboard and by any means escape them i now took it for granted that i was once more in the power of mr falkland and the idea was insupportably mortifying and oppressive to my imagination escape from his pursuit freedom from his tyranny were objects upon which my whole soul was bent could no human ingenuity and exertion effect them did his power reach through all space and his eye penetrate every concealment was he like that mysterious being to protect us from whose fierce revenge mountains and hills we are told might fall on us in vain no idea is more heartsickening and tremendous than this but in my case it was not a subject of reasoning or of faith i could derive no comfort either directly from the unbelief which upon religious subjects some men avow to their own minds or secretly from the remoteness and incomprehensibility of the conception it was an affair of sense i felt the fangs of the tiger striking deep into my heart but though this impression was at first exceedingly strong and accompanied with its usual attendants of dejection and pusillanimity my mind soon began as it were mechanically to turn upon the consideration of the distance between this seaport and my county prison and the various opportunities of escape that might offer themselves in the interval my first duty was to avoid betraying myself more than it might afterwards appear i was betrayed already it was possible that though apprehended my apprehension might have been determined on upon some slight score and that by my dexterity i might render my dismission as sudden as my arrest had been it was even possible that i had been seized through a mistake and that the present measure might have no connection with mr falklands affair upon every supposition it was my business to gain information in my passage from the ship to the town i did not utter a word my conductors commented on my sulkiness but remarked that it would avail me nothingâ€”i should infallibly swing as it was never known that any body got off who was tried for robbing his majestys mail it is difficult to conceive the lightness of heart which was communicated to me by these words i persisted however in the silence i had meditated from the rest of their conversation which was sufficiently voluble i learned that the mail from edinburgh to london had been robbed about ten days before by two irishmen that one of them was already secured and that i was taken up upon suspicion of being the other they had a description of his person which though as i afterwards found it disagreed from mine in several material articles appeared to them to tally to the minutest tittle the intelligence that the whole proceeding against me was founded in a mistake took an oppressive load from my mind i believed that i should immediately be able to establish my innocence to the satisfaction of any magistrate in the kingdom and though crossed in my plans and thwarted in my design of quitting the island even after i was already at sea this was but a trifling inconvenience compared with what i had had but too much reason to fear as soon as we came ashore i was conducted to the house of a justice of peace a man who had formerly been the captain of a collier but who having been successful in the world had quitted this wandering life and for some years had had the honour to represent his majestys person we were detained for some time in a sort of antiroom waiting his reverences leisure the persons by whom i had been taken up were experienced in their trade and insisted upon employing this interval in searching me in presence of two of his worships servants they found upon me fifteen guineas and some silver they required me to strip myself perfectly naked that they might examine whether i had banknotes concealed any where about my person they took up the detached parcels of my miserable attire as i threw it from me and felt them one by one to discover whether the articles of which they were in search might by any device be sewn up in them to all this i submitted without murmuring it might probably come to the same thing at last and summary justice was sufficiently coincident with my views my principal object being to get as soon as possible out of the clutches of the respectable persons who now had me in custody this operation was scarcely completed before we were directed to be ushered into his worships apartment my accusers opened the charge and told him they had been ordered to this town upon an intimation that one of the persons who robbed the edinburgh mail was to be found here and that they had taken me on board a vessel which was by this time under sail for ireland well says his worship that is your story now let us hear what account the gentleman gives of himself what is your nameâ€”ha sirrah and from what part of tipperary are you pleased to come i had already taken my determination upon this article and the moment i learned the particulars of the charge against me resolved for the present at least to lay aside my irish accent and speak my native tongue this i had done in the very few words i had spoken to my conductors in the antiroom they started at the metamorphosis but they had gone too far for it to be possible they should retract in consistence with their honour i now told the justice that i was no irishman nor had ever been in that country i was a native of england this occasioned a consulting of the deposition in which my person was supposed to be described and which my conductors had brought with them for their direction to be sure that required that the offender should be an irishman observing his worship hesitate i thought this was the time to push the matter a little further i referred to the paper and showed that the description neither tallied as to height nor complexion but then it did as to years and the colour of the hair and it was not this gentlemans habit as he informed me to squabble about trifles or to let a mans neck out of the halter for a pretended flaw of a few inches in his stature if a man were too short he said there was no remedy like a little stretching the miscalculation in my case happened to be the opposite way but his reverence did not think proper to lose his jest upon the whole he was somewhat at a loss how to proceed my conductors observed this and began to tremble for the reward which two hours ago they thought as good as in their own pocket to retain me in custody they judged to be a safe speculation if it turned out a mistake at last they felt little apprehension of a suit for false imprisonment from a poor man accoutred as i was in rags they therefore urged his worship to comply with their views they told him that to be sure the evidence against me did not prove so strong as for their part they heartily wished it had but that there were a number of suspicious circumstances respecting me when i was brought up to them upon the deck of the vessel i spoke as fine an irish brogue as one shall hear in a summers day and now all at once there was not the least particle of it left in searching me they had found upon me fifteen guineas how should a poor beggar lad such as i appeared come honestly by fifteen guineas besides when they had stripped me naked though my dress was so shabby my skin had all the sleekness of a gentleman in fine for what purpose could a poor beggar who had never been in ireland in his life want to transport himself to that country it was as clear as the sun that i was no better than i should be this reasoning together with some significant winks and gestures between the justice and the plaintiffs brought him over to their way of thinking he said i must go to warwick where it seems the other robber was at present in custody and be confronted with him and if then every thing appeared fair and satisfactory i should be discharged no intelligence could be more terrible than that which was contained in these words that i who had found the whole country in arms against me who was exposed to a pursuit so peculiarly vigilant and penetrating should now be dragged to the very centre of the kingdom without power of accommodating myself to circumstances and under the immediate custody of the officers of justice seemed to my ears almost the same thing as if he had pronounced upon me a sentence of death i strenuously urged the injustice of this proceeding i observed to the magistrate that it was impossible i should be the person at whom the description pointed it required an irishman i was no irishman it described a person shorter than i a circumstance of all others the least capable of being counterfeited there was not the slightest reason for detaining me in custody i had been already disappointed of my voyage and lost the money i had paid down through the officiousness of these gentlemen in apprehending me i assured his worship that every delay under my circumstances was of the utmost importance to me it was impossible to devise a greater injury to be inflicted on me than the proposal that instead of being permitted to proceed upon my voyage i should be sent under arrest into the heart of the kingdom my remonstrances were vain the justice was by no means inclined to digest the being expostulated with in this manner by a person in the habiliments of a beggar in the midst of my address he would have silenced me for my impertinence but that i spoke with an earnestness with which he was wholly unable to contend when i had finished he told me it was all to no purpose and that it might have been better for me if i had shown myself less insolent it was clear that i was a vagabond and a suspicious person the more earnest i showed myself to get off the more reason there was he should keep me fast perhaps after all i should turn out to be the felon in question but if i was not that he had no doubt i was worse a poacher or for what he knew a murderer he had a kind of a notion that he had seen my face before about some such affair out of all doubt i was an old offender he had it in his choice to send me to hard labour as a vagrant upon the strength of my appearance and the contradictions in my story or to order me to warwick and out of the spontaneous goodness of his disposition he chose the milder side of the alternative he could assure me i should not slip through his fingers it was of more benefit to his majestys government to hang one such fellow as he suspected me to be than out of mistaken tenderness to concern ones self for the good of all the beggars in the nation finding it was impossible to work in the way i desired on a man so fully impressed with his own dignity and importance and my utter insignificance i claimed that at least the money taken from my person should be restored to me this was granted his worship perhaps suspected that he had stretched a point in what he had already done and was therefore the less unwilling to relax in this incidental circumstance my conductors did not oppose themselves to this indulgence for a reason that will appear in the sequel the justice however enlarged upon his clemency in this proceeding he did not know whether he was not exceeding the spirit of his commission in complying with my demand so much money in my possession could not be honestly come by but it was his temper to soften as far as could be done with propriety the strict letter of the law there were cogent reasons why the gentlemen who had originally taken me into custody chose that i should continue in their custody when my examination was over every man is in his different mode susceptible to a sense of honour and they did not choose to encounter the disgrace that would accrue to them if justice had been done every man is in some degree influenced by the love of power and they were willing i should owe any benefit i received to their sovereign grace and benignity and not to the mere reason of the case it was not however an unsubstantial honour and barren power that formed the objects of their pursuit no their views were deeper than that in a word though they chose that i should retire from the seat of justice as i had come before it a prisoner yet the tenor of my examination had obliged them in spite of themselves to suspect that i was innocent of the charge alleged against me apprehensive therefore that the hundred guineas which had been offered as a reward for taking the robber was completely out of the question in the present business they were contented to strike at smaller game having conducted me to an inn and given directions respecting a vehicle for the journey they took me aside while one of them addressed me in the following mannerâ€” you see my lad how the case stands hey for warwick is the word i and when we are got there what may happen then i will not pretend for to say whether you are innocent or no is no business of mine but you are not such a chicken as to suppose if so be as you are innocent that that will make your game altogether sure you say your business calls you another way and as how you are in haste i scorns to cross any man in his concerns if i can help it if therefore you will give us them there fifteen shiners why snug is the word they are of no use to you a beggar you know is always at home for the matter of that we could have had them in the way of business as you saw at the justices but i am a man of principle i loves to do things above board and scorns to extort a shilling from any man he who is tinctured with principles of moral discrimination is apt upon occasion to be run away with by his feelings in that respect and to forget the immediate interest of the moment i confess that the first sentiment excited in my mind by this overture was that of indignation i was irresistibly impelled to give utterance to this feeling and postpone for a moment the consideration of the future i replied with the severity which so base a proceeding appeared to deserve my bearleaders were considerably surprised with my firmness but seemed to think it beneath them to contest with me the principles i delivered he who had made the overture contented himself with replying well well my lad do as you will you are not the first man that has been hanged rather than part with a few guineas his words did not pass unheeded by me they were strikingly applicable to my situation and i was determined not to suffer the occasion to escape me unimproved the pride of these gentlemen however was too great to admit of further parley for the present they left me abruptly having first ordered an old man the father of the landlady to stay in the room with me while they were absent the old man they ordered for security to lock the door and put the key in his pocket at the same time mentioning below stairs the station in which they had left me that the people of the house might have an eye upon what went forward and not suffer me to escape what was the intention of this manoeuvre i am unable certainly to pronounce probably it was a sort of compromise between their pride and their avarice being desirous for some reason or other to drop me as soon as convenient and therefore determining to wait the result of my private meditations on the proposal they had made  chapter vii they were no sooner withdrawn than i cast my eye upon the old man and found something extremely venerable and interesting in his appearance his form was above the middle size it indicated that his strength had been once considerable nor was it at this time by any means annihilated his hair was in considerable quantity and was as white as the drifted snow his complexion was healthful and ruddy at the same time that his face was furrowed with wrinkles in his eye there was remarkable vivacity and his whole countenance was strongly expressive of goodnature the boorishness of his rank in society was lost in the cultivation his mind had derived from habits of sensibility and benevolence the view of his figure immediately introduced a train of ideas into my mind respecting the advantage to be drawn from the presence of such a person the attempt to take any step without his consent was hopeless for though i should succeed with regard to him he could easily give the alarm to other persons who would no doubt be within call add to which i could scarcely have prevailed on myself to offer any offence to a person whose first appearance so strongly engaged my affection and esteem in reality my thoughts were turned into a different channel i was impressed with an ardent wish to be able to call this man my benefactor pursued by a train of ill fortune i could no longer consider myself as a member of society i was a solitary being cut off from the expectation of sympathy kindness and the goodwill of mankind i was strongly impelled by the situation in which the present moment placed me to indulge in a luxury which my destiny seemed to have denied i could not conceive the smallest comparison between the idea of deriving my liberty from the spontaneous kindness of a worthy and excellent mind and that of being indebted for it to the selfishness and baseness of the worst members of society it was thus that i allowed myself in the wantonness of refinement even in the midst of destruction guided by these sentiments i requested his attention to the circumstances by which i had been brought into my present situation he immediately signified his assent and said he would cheerfully listen to any thing i thought proper to communicate i told him the persons who had just left me in charge with him had come to this town for the purpose of apprehending some person who had been guilty of robbing the mail that they had chosen to take me up under this warrant and had conducted me before a justice of the peace that they had soon detected their mistake the person in question being an irishman and differing from me both in country and stature but that by collusion between them and the justice they were permitted to retain me in custody and pretended to undertake to conduct me to warwick to confront me with my accomplice that in searching me at the justices they had found a sum of money in my possession which excited their cupidity and that they had just been proposing to me to give me my liberty upon condition of my surrendering this sum into their hands under these circumstances i requested him to consider whether he would wish to render himself the instrument of their extortion i put myself into his hands and solemnly averred the truth of the facts i had just stated if he would assist me in my escape it could have no other effect than to disappoint the base passions of my conductors i would upon no account expose him to any real inconvenience but i was well assured that the same generosity that should prompt him to a good deed would enable him effectually to vindicate it when done and that those who detained me when they had lost sight of their prey would feel covered with confusion and not dare to take another step in the affair the old man listened to what i related with curiosity and interest he said that he had always felt an abhorrence to the sort of people who had me in their hands that he had an aversion to the task they had just imposed upon him but that he could not refuse some little disagreeable offices to oblige his daughter and soninlaw he had no doubt from my countenance and manner of the truth of what i had asserted to him it was an extraordinary request i had made and he did not know what had induced me to think him the sort of person to whom with any prospect of success it might be made in reality however his habits of thinking were uncommon and he felt more than half inclined to act as i desired one thing at least he would ask of me in return which was to be faithfully informed in some degree respecting the person he was desired to oblige what was my name the question came upon me unprepared but whatever might be the consequence i could not bear to deceive the person by whom it was put and in the circumstances under which it was put the practice of perpetual falsehood is too painful a task i replied that my name was williams he paused his eye was fixed upon me i saw his complexion alter at the repetition of that word he proceeded with visible anxiety my christian name caleb good god it could not be  he conjured me by every thing that was sacred to answer him faithfully to one question more i was notâ€”no it was impossibleâ€”the person who had formerly lived servant with mr falkland of  i told him that whatever might be the meaning of his question i would answer him truly i was the individual he mentioned as i uttered these words the old man rose from his seat he was sorry that fortune had been so unpropitious to him as for him ever to have set eyes upon me i was a monster with whom the very earth groaned i entreated that he would suffer me to explain this new misapprehension as he had done in the former instance i had no doubt that i should do it equally to his satisfaction no no no he would upon no consideration admit that his ears should suffer such contamination this case and the other were very different there was no criminal upon the face of the earth no murderer half so detestable as the person who could prevail upon himself to utter the charges i had done by way of recrimination against so generous a masterâ€”the old man was in a perfect agony with the recollection at length he calmed himself enough to say he should never cease to grieve that he had held a moments parley with me he did not know what was the conduct severe justice required of him but since he had come into the knowledge of who i was only by my own confession it was irreconcilably repugnant to his feelings to make use of that knowledge to my injury here therefore all relation between us ceased as indeed it would be an abuse of words to consider me in the light of a human creature he would do me no mischief but on the other hand he would not for the world be in any way assisting and abetting me i was inexpressibly affected at the abhorrence this good and benevolent creature expressed against me i could not be silent i endeavoured once and again to prevail upon him to hear me but his determination was unalterable our contest lasted for some time and he at length terminated it by ringing the bell and calling up the waiter a very little while after my conductors entered and the other persons withdrew it was a part of the singularity of my fate that it hurried me from one species of anxiety and distress to another too rapidly to suffer any one of them to sink deeply into my mind i am apt to believe in the retrospect that half the calamities i was destined to endure would infallibly have overwhelmed and destroyed me but as it was i had no leisure to chew the cud upon misfortunes as they befel me but was under the necessity of forgetting them to guard against peril that the next moment seemed ready to crush me the behaviour of this incomparable and amiable old man cut me to the heart it was a dreadful prognostic for all my future life but as i have just observed my conductors entered and another subject called imperiously upon my attention i could have been content mortified as i was at this instant to have been shut up in some impenetrable solitude and to have wrapped myself in inconsolable misery but the grief i endured had not such power over me as that i could be content to risk the being led to the gallows the love of life and still more a hatred against oppression steeled my heart against that species of inertness in the scene that had just passed i had indulged as i have said in a wantonness and luxury of refinement it was time that indulgence should be brought to a period it was dangerous to trifle any more upon the brink of fate and penetrated as i was with sadness by the result of my last attempt i was little disposed to unnecessary circumambulation i was exactly in the temper in which the gentlemen who had me in their power would have desired to find me accordingly we entered immediately upon business and after some chaffering they agreed to accept eleven guineas as the price of my freedom to preserve however the chariness of their reputation they insisted upon conducting me with them for a few miles on the outside of a stagecoach they then pretended that the road they had to travel lay in a cross country direction and having quitted the vehicle they suffered me almost as soon as it was out of sight to shake off this troublesome association and follow my own inclinations it may be worth remarking by the way that these fellows outwitted themselves at their own trade they had laid hold of me at first under the idea of a prize of a hundred guineas they had since been glad to accept a composition of eleven but if they had retained me a little longer in their possession they would have found the possibility of acquiring the sum that had originally excited their pursuit upon a different score the mischances that had befallen me in my late attempt to escape from my pursuers by sea deterred me from the thought of repeating that experiment i therefore once more returned to the suggestion of hiding myself at least for the present amongst the crowds of the metropolis meanwhile i by no means thought proper to venture by the direct route and the less so as that was the course which would be steered by my late conductors but took my road along the borders of wales the only incident worth relating in this place occurred in an attempt to cross the severn in a particular point the mode was by a ferry but by some strange inadvertence i lost my way so completely as to be wholly unable that night to reach the ferry and arrive at the town which i had destined for my repose this may seem a petty disappointment in the midst of the overwhelming considerations that might have been expected to engross every thought of my mind yet it was borne by me with singular impatience i was that day uncommonly fatigued previously to the time that i mistook or at least was aware of the mistake of the road the sky had become black and lowring and soon after the clouds burst down in sheets of rain i was in the midst of a heath without a tree or covering of any sort to shelter me i was thoroughly drenched in a moment i pushed on with a sort of sullen determination by and by the rain gave place to a storm of hail the hailstones were large and frequent i was ill defended by the miserable covering i wore and they seemed to cut me in a thousand directions the hailstorm subsided and was again succeeded by a heavy rain by this time it was that i had perceived i was wholly out of my road i could discover neither man nor beast nor habitation of any kind i walked on measuring at every turn the path it would be proper to pursue but in no instance finding a sufficient reason to reject one or prefer another my mind was bursting with depression and anguish i muttered imprecations and murmuring as i passed along i was full of loathing and abhorrence of life and all that life carries in its train after wandering without any certain direction for two hours i was overtaken by the night the scene was nearly pathless and it was vain to think of proceeding any farther here i was without comfort without shelter and without food there was not a particle of my covering that was not as wet as if it had been fished from the bottom of the ocean my teeth chattered i trembled in every limb my heart burned with universal fury at one moment i stumbled and fell over some unseen obstacle at another i was turned back by an impediment i could not overcome there was no strict connection between these casual inconveniences and the persecution under which i laboured but my distempered thoughts confounded them together i cursed the whole system of human existence i said here i am an outcast destined to perish with hunger and cold all men desert me all men hate me i am driven with mortal threats from the sources of comfort and existence accursed world that hates without a cause that overwhelms innocence with calamities which ought to be spared even to guilt accursed world dead to every manly sympathy with eyes of horn and hearts of steel why do i consent to live any longer why do i seek to drag on an existence which if protracted must be protracted amidst the lairs of these human tigers this paroxysm at length exhausted itself presently after i discovered a solitary shed which i was contented to resort to for shelter in a corner of the shed i found some clean straw i threw off my rags placed them in a situation where they would best be dried and buried myself amidst this friendly warmth here i forgot by degrees the anguish that had racked me a wholesome shed and fresh straw may seem but scanty benefits but they offered themselves when least expected and my whole heart was lightened by the encounter through fatigue of mind and body it happened in this instance though in general my repose was remarkably short that i slept till almost noon of the next day when i rose i found that i was at no great distance from the ferry which i crossed and entered the town where i intended to have rested the preceding night it was marketday as i passed near the cross i observed two people look at me with great earnestness after which one of them exclaimed i will be damned if i do not think that this is the very fellow those men were enquiring for who set off an hour ago by the coach for  i was extremely alarmed at this information and quickening my pace turned sharp down a narrow lane the moment i was out of sight i ran with all the speed i could exert and did not think myself safe till i was several miles distant from the place where this information had reached my ears i have always believed that the men to whom it related were the very persons who had apprehended me on board the ship in which i had embarked for ireland that by some accident they had met with the description of my person as published on the part of mr falkland and that from putting together the circumstances they had been led to believe that this was the very individual who had lately been in their custody indeed it was a piece of infatuation in me for which i am now unable to account that after the various indications which had occurred in that affair proving to them that i was a man in critical and peculiar circumstances i should have persisted in wearing the same disguise without the smallest alteration my escape in the present case was eminently fortunate if i had not lost my way in consequence of the hailstorm on the preceding night or if i had not so greatly overslept myself this very morning i must almost infallibly have fallen into the hands of these infernal bloodhunters the town they had chosen for their next stage the name of which i had thus caught in the marketplace was the town to which but for this intimation i should have immediately proceeded as it was i determined to take a road as wide of it as possible in the first place to which i came in which it was practicable to do so i bought a great coat which i drew over my beggars weeds and a better hat the hat i slouched over my face and covered one of my eyes with a greensilk shade the handkerchief which i had hitherto worn about my head i now tied about the lower part of my visage so as to cover my mouth by degrees i discarded every part of my former dress and wore for my upper garment a kind of carmans frock which being of the better sort made me look like the son of a reputable farmer of the lower class thus equipped i proceeded on my journey and after a thousand alarms precautions and circuitous deviations from the direct path arrived safely in london  chapter viii here then was the termination of an immense series of labours upon which no man could have looked back without astonishment or forward without a sentiment bordering on despair it was at a price which defies estimation that i had purchased this restingplace whether we consider the efforts it had cost me to escape from the walls of my prison or the dangers and anxieties to which i had been a prey from that hour to the present but why do i call the point at which i was now arrived at a restingplace alas it was diametrically the reverse it was my first and immediate business to review all the projects of disguise i had hitherto conceived to derive every improvement i could invent from the practice to which i had been subjected and to manufacture a veil of concealment more impenetrable than ever this was an effort to which i could see no end in ordinary cases the hue and cry after a supposed offender is a matter of temporary operation but ordinary cases formed no standard for the colossal intelligence of mr falkland for the same reason london which appears an inexhaustible reservoir of concealment to the majority of mankind brought no such consolatory sentiment to my mind whether life were worth accepting on such terms i cannot pronounce i only know that i persisted in this exertion of my faculties through a sort of parental love that men are accustomed to entertain for their intellectual offspring the more thought i had expended in rearing it to its present perfection the less did i find myself disposed to abandon it another motive not less strenuously exciting me to perseverance was the evergrowing repugnance i felt to injustice and arbitrary power the first evening of my arrival in town i slept at an obscure inn in the borough of southwark choosing that side of the metropolis on account of its lying entirely wide of the part of england from which i came i entered the inn in the evening in my countrymans frock and having paid for my lodging before i went to bed equipped myself next morning as differently as my wardrobe would allow and left the house before day the frock i made up into a small packet and having carried it to a distance as great as i thought necessary i dropped it in the corner of an alley through which i passed my next care was to furnish myself with another suit of apparel totally different from any to which i had hitherto had recourse the exterior which i was now induced to assume was that of a jew one of the gang of thieves upon  forest had been of that race and by the talent of mimicry which i have already stated myself to possess i could copy their pronunciation of the english language sufficiently to answer such occasions as were likely to present themselves one of the preliminaries i adopted was to repair to a quarter of the town in which great numbers of this people reside and study their complexion and countenance having made such provision as my prudence suggested to me i retired for that night to an inn in the midway between mileend and wapping here i accoutred myself in my new habiliments and having employed the same precautions as before retired from my lodging at a time least exposed to observation it is unnecessary to describe the particulars of my new equipage suffice it to say that one of my cares was to discolour my complexion and give it the dun and sallow hue which is in most instances characteristic of the tribe to which i assumed to belong and that when my metamorphosis was finished i could not upon the strictest examination conceive that any one could have traced out the person of caleb williams in this new disguise thus far advanced in the execution of my project i deemed it advisable to procure a lodging and change my late wandering life for a stationary one in this lodging i constantly secluded myself from the rising to the setting of the sun the periods i allowed for exercise and air were few and those few by night i was even cautious of so much as approaching the window of my apartment though upon the attic story a principle i laid down to myself was not wantonly and unnecessarily to expose myself to risk however slight that risk might appear here let me pause for a moment to bring before the reader in the way in which it was impressed upon my mind the nature of my situation i was born free i was born healthy vigorous and active complete in all the lineaments and members of a human body i was not born indeed to the possession of hereditary wealth but i had a better inheritance an enterprising mind an inquisitive spirit a liberal ambition in a word i accepted my lot with willingness and content i did not fear but i should make my cause good in the lists of existence i was satisfied to aim at small things i was pleased to play at first for a slender stake i was more willing to grow than to descend in my individual significance the free spirit and the firm heart with which i commenced one circumstance was sufficient to blast i was ignorant of the power which the institutions of society give to one man over others i had fallen unwarily into the hands of a person who held it as his fondest wish to oppress and destroy me i found myself subjected undeservedly on my part to all the disadvantages which mankind if they reflected upon them would hesitate to impose on acknowledged guilt in every human countenance i feared to find the countenance of an enemy i shrunk from the vigilance of every human eye i dared not open my heart to the best affections of our nature i was shut up a deserted solitary wretch in the midst of my species i dared not look for the consolations of friendship but instead of seeking to identify myself with the joys and sorrows of others and exchanging the delicious gifts of confidence and sympathy was compelled to centre my thoughts and my vigilance in myself my life was all a lie i had a counterfeit character to support i had counterfeit manners to assume my gait my gestures my accents were all of them to be studied i was not free to indulge no not one honest sally of the soul attended with these disadvantages i was to procure myself a subsistence a subsistence to be acquired with infinite precautions and to be consumed without the hope of enjoyment this even this i was determined to endure to put my shoulder to the burthen and support it with unshrinking firmness let it not however be supposed that i endured it without repining and abhorrence my time was divided between the terrors of an animal that skulks from its pursuers the obstinacy of unshrinking firmness and that elastic revulsion that from time to time seems to shrivel the very hearts of the miserable if at some moments i fiercely defied all the rigours of my fate at others and those of frequent recurrence i sunk into helpless despondence i looked forward without hope through the series of my existence tears of anguish rushed from my eyes my courage became extinct and i cursed the conscious life that was reproduced with every returning day why upon such occasions i was accustomed to exclaim why am i overwhelmed with the load of existence why are all these engines at work to torment me i am no murderer yet if i were what worse could i be fated to suffer how vile squalid and disgraceful is the state to which i am condemned this is not my place in the roll of existence the place for which either my temper or my understanding has prepared me to what purpose serve the restless aspirations of my soul but to make me like a frighted bird beat myself in vain against the enclosure of my cage nature barbarous nature to me thou hast proved indeed the worst of stepmothers endowed me with wishes insatiate and sunk me in neverending degradation i might have thought myself more secure if i had been in possession of money upon which to subsist the necessity of earning for myself the means of existence evidently tended to thwart the plan of secrecy to which i was condemned whatever labour i adopted or deemed myself qualified to discharge it was first to be considered how i was to be provided with employment and where i was to find an employer or purchaser for my commodities in the mean time i had no alternative the little money with which i had escaped from the bloodhunters was almost expended after the minutest consideration i was able to bestow upon this question i determined that literature should be the field of my first experiment i had read of money being acquired in this way and of prices given by the speculators in this sort of ware to its proper manufacturers my qualifications i esteemed at a slender valuation i was not without a conviction that experience and practice must pave the way to excellent production but though of these i was utterly destitute my propensities had always led me in this direction and my early thirst of knowledge had conducted me to a more intimate acquaintance with books than could perhaps have been expected under my circumstances if my literary pretensions were slight the demand i intended to make upon them was not great all i asked was a subsistence and i was persuaded few persons could subsist upon slenderer means than myself i also considered this as a temporary expedient and hoped that accident or time might hereafter place me in a less precarious situation the reasons that principally determined my choice were that this employment called upon me for the least preparation and could as i thought be exercised with least observation there was a solitary woman of middle age who tenanted a chamber in this house upon the same floor with my own i had no sooner determined upon the destination of my industry than i cast my eye upon her as the possible instrument for disposing of my productions excluded as i was from all intercourse with my species in general i found pleasure in the occasional exchange of a few words with this inoffensive and goodhumoured creature who was already of an age to preclude scandal she lived upon a very small annuity allowed her by a distant relation a woman of quality who possessed of thousands herself had no other anxiety with respect to this person than that she should not contaminate her alliance by the exertion of honest industry this humble creature was of a uniformly cheerful and active disposition unacquainted alike with the cares of wealth and the pressure of misfortune though her pretensions were small and her information slender she was by no means deficient in penetration she remarked the faults and follies of mankind with no contemptible discernment but her temper was of so mild and forgiving a cast as would have induced most persons to believe that she perceived nothing of the matter her heart overflowed with the milk of kindness she was sincere and ardent in her attachments and never did she omit a service which she perceived herself able to render to a human being had it not been for these qualifications of temper i should probably have found that my appearance that of a deserted solitary lad of jewish extraction effectually precluded my demands upon her kindness but i speedily perceived from her manner of receiving and returning civilities of an indifferent sort that her heart was too noble to have its effusions checked by any base and unworthy considerations encouraged by these preliminaries i determined to select her as my agent i found her willing and alert in the business i proposed to her that i might anticipate occasions of suspicion i frankly told her that for reasons which i wished to be excused from relating but which if related i was sure would not deprive me of her good opinion i found it necessary for the present to keep myself private with this statement she readily acquiesced and told me that she had no desire for any further information than i found it expedient to give my first productions were of the poetical kind after having finished two or three i directed this generous creature to take them to the office of a newspaper but they were rejected with contempt by the aristarchus of that place who having bestowed on them a superficial glance told her that such matters were not in his way i cannot help mentioning in this place that the countenance of mrs marney this was the name of my ambassadress was in all cases a perfect indication of her success and rendered explanation by words wholly unnecessary she interested herself so unreservedly in what she undertook that she felt either miscarriage or good fortune much more exquisitely than i did i had an unhesitating confidence in my own resources and occupied as i was in meditations more interesting and more painful i regarded these matters as altogether trivial i quietly took the pieces back and laid them upon my table upon revisal i altered and transcribed one of them and joining it with two others despatched them together to the editor of a magazine he desired they might be left with him till the day after tomorrow when that day came he told my friend they should be inserted but mrs marney asking respecting the price he replied it was their constant rule to give nothing for poetical compositions the letterbox being always full of writings of that sort but if the gentleman would try his hand in prose a short essay or a tale he would see what he could do for him with the requisition of my literary dictator i immediately complied i attempted a paper in the style of addisons spectators which was accepted in a short time i was upon an established footing in this quarter i however distrusted my resources in the way of moral disquisition and soon turned my thoughts to his other suggestion a tale his demands upon me were now frequent and to facilitate my labours i bethought myself of the resource of translation i had scarcely any convenience with respect to the procuring of books but as my memory was retentive i frequently translated or modelled my narrative upon a reading of some years before by a fatality for which i did not exactly know how to account my thoughts frequently led me to the histories of celebrated robbers and i related from time to time incidents and anecdotes of cartouche gusman dalfarache and other memorable worthies whose career was terminated upon the gallows or the scaffold in the mean time a retrospect to my own situation rendered a perseverance even in this industry difficult to be maintained i often threw down my pen in an ecstasy of despair sometimes for whole days together i was incapable of action and sunk into a sort of partial stupor too wretched to be described youth and health however enabled me from time to time to get the better of my dejection and to rouse myself to something like a gaiety which if it had been permanent might have made this interval of my story tolerable to my reflections  chapter ix while i was thus endeavouring to occupy and provide for the intermediate period till the violence of the pursuit after me might be abated a new source of danger opened upon me of which i had no previous suspicion gines the thief who had been expelled from captain raymonds gang had fluctuated during the last years of his life between the two professions of a violator of the laws and a retainer to their administration he had originally devoted himself to the first and probably his initiation in the mysteries of thieving qualified him to be peculiarly expert in the profession of a thieftakerâ€”a profession he had adopted not from choice but necessity in this employment his reputation was great though perhaps not equal to his merits for it happens here as in other departments of human society that however the subalterns may furnish wisdom and skill the principals exclusively possess the Ã©clat he was exercising this art in a very prosperous manner when it happened by some accident that one or two of his achievements previous to his having shaken off the dregs of unlicensed depredation were in danger of becoming subjects of public attention having had repeated intimations of this he thought it prudent to decamp and it was during this period of his retreat that he entered into the  gang such was the history of this man antecedently to his being placed in the situation in which i had first encountered him at the time of that encounter he was a veteran of captain raymonds gang for thieves being a shortlived race the character of veteran costs the less time in acquiring upon his expulsion from this community he returned once more to his lawful profession and by his old comrades was received with congratulation as a lost sheep in the vulgar classes of society no length of time is sufficient to expiate a crime but among the honourable fraternity of thieftakers it is a rule never to bring one of their own brethren to a reckoning when it can with any decency be avoided they are probably reluctant to fix an unnecessary stain upon the ermine of their profession another rule observed by those who have passed through the same gradation as gines had done and which was adopted by gines himself is always to reserve such as have been the accomplices of their depredations to the last and on no account to assail them without great necessity or powerful temptation for this reason according to giness system of tactics captain raymond and his confederates were as he would have termed it safe from his retaliation but though gines was in this sense of the term a man of strict honour my case unfortunately did not fall within the laws of honour he acknowledged misfortune had overtaken me and i was on all sides without protection or shelter the persecution to which i was exposed was founded upon the supposition of my having committed felony to an immense amount but in this gines had had no participation he was careless whether the supposition were true or false and hated me as much as if my innocence had been established beyond the reach of suspicion the bloodhunters who had taken me into custody at  related as usual among their fraternity a part of their adventure and told of the reason which inclined them to suppose that the individual who had passed through their custody was the very caleb williams for whose apprehension a reward had been offered of a hundred guineas gines whose acuteness was eminent in the way of his profession by comparing facts and dates was induced to suspect in his own mind that caleb williams was the person he had hustled and wounded upon  forest against that person he entertained the bitterest aversion i had been the innocent occasion of his being expelled with disgrace from captain raymonds gang and gines as i afterwards understood was intimately persuaded that there was no comparison between the liberal and manly profession of a robber from which i had driven him and the sordid and mechanical occupation of a bloodhunter to which he was obliged to return he no sooner received the information i have mentioned than he vowed revenge he determined to leave all other objects and consecrate every faculty of his mind to the unkennelling me from my hidingplace the offered reward which his vanity made him consider as assuredly his own appeared as the complete indemnification of his labour and expense thus i had to encounter the sagacity he possessed in the way of his profession whetted and stimulated by a sentiment of vengeance in a mind that knew no restraint from conscience or humanity when i drew to myself a picture of my situation soon after having fixed on my present abode i foolishly thought as the unhappy are accustomed to do that my calamity would admit of no aggravation the aggravation which unknown to me at this time occurred was the most fearful that any imagination could have devised nothing could have happened more critically hostile to my future peace than my fatal encounter with gines upon  forest by this means as it now appears i had fastened upon myself a second enemy of that singular and dreadful sort that is determined never to dismiss its animosity as long as life shall endure while falkland was the hungry lion whose roarings astonished and appalled me gines was a noxious insect scarcely less formidable and tremendous that hovered about my goings and perpetually menaced me with the poison of his sting the first step pursued by him in execution of his project was to set out for the seaport town where i had formerly been apprehended from thence he traced me to the banks of the severn and from the banks of the severn to london it is scarcely necessary to observe that this is always practicable provided the pursuer have motives strong enough to excite him to perseverance unless the precautions of the fugitive be in the highest degree both judicious in the conception and fortunate in the execution gines indeed in the course of his pursuit was often obliged to double his steps and like the harrier whenever he was at a fault return to the place where he had last perceived the scent of the animal whose death he had decreed he spared neither pains nor time in the gratification of the passion which choice had made his ruling one upon my arrival in town he for a moment lost all trace of me london being a place in which on account of the magnitude of its dimensions it might well be supposed that an individual could remain hidden and unknown but no difficulty could discourage this new adversary he went from inn to inn reasonably supposing that there was no private house to which i could immediately repair till he found by the description he gave and the recollections he excited that i had slept for one night in the borough of southwark but he could get no further information the people of the inn had no knowledge what had become of me the next morning this however did but render him more eager in the pursuit the describing me was now more difficult on account of the partial change of dress i had made the second day of my being in town but gines at length overcame the obstacle from that quarter having traced me to my second inn he was here furnished with a more copious information i had been a subject of speculation for the leisure hours of some of the persons belonging to this inn an old woman of a most curious and loquacious disposition who lived opposite to it and who that morning rose early to her washing had espied me from her window by the light of a large lamp which hung over the inn as i issued from the gate she had but a very imperfect view of me but she thought there was something jewish in my appearance she was accustomed to hold a conference every morning with the landlady of the inn some of the waiters and chambermaids occasionally assisting at it in the course of the dialogue of this morning she asked some questions about the jew who had slept there the night before no jew had slept there the curiosity of the landlady was excited in her turn by the time of the morning it could be no other but me it was very strange they compared notes respecting my appearance and dress no two things could be more dissimilar the jew christian upon any dearth of subjects of intelligence repeatedly furnished matter for their discourse the information thus afforded to gines appeared exceedingly material but the performance did not for some time keep pace with the promise he could not enter every private house into which lodgers were ever admitted in the same manner that he had treated the inns he walked the streets and examined with a curious and inquisitive eye the countenance of every jew about my stature but in vain he repaired to dukes place and the synagogues it was not here that in reality he could calculate upon finding me but he resorted to those means in despair and as a last hope he was more than once upon the point of giving up the pursuit but he was recalled to it by an insatiable and restless appetite for revenge it was during this perturbed and fluctuating state of his mind that he chanced to pay a visit to a brother of his who was the headworkman of a printingoffice there was little intercourse between these two persons their dispositions and habits of life being extremely dissimilar the printer was industrious sober inclined to methodism and of a propensity to accumulation he was extremely dissatisfied with the character and pursuits of his brother and had made some ineffectual attempts to reclaim him but though they by no means agreed in their habits of thinking they sometimes saw each other gines loved to boast of as many of his achievements as he dared venture to mention and his brother was one more hearer in addition to the set of his usual associates the printer was amused with the blunt sagacity of remark and novelty of incident that characterised giness conversation he was secretly pleased in spite of all his sober and churchgoing prejudices that he was brother to a man of so much ingenuity and fortitude after having listened for some time upon this occasion to the wonderful stories which gines in his rugged way condescended to tell the printer felt an ambition to entertain his brother in his turn he began to retail some of my stories of cartouche and gusman dalfarache the attention of gines was excited his first emotion was wonder his second was envy and aversion where did the printer get these stories this question was answered i will tell you what said the printer we none of us know what to make of the writer of these articles he writes poetry and morality and history i am a printer and corrector of the press and may pretend without vanity to be a tolerably good judge of these matters he writes them all to my mind extremely fine and yet he is no more than a jew to my honest printer this seemed as strange as if they had been written by a cherokee chieftain at the falls of the mississippi a jew how do you know did you ever see him no the matter is always brought to us by a woman but my master hates mysteries he likes to see his authors himself so he plagues and plagues the old woman but he can never get any thing out of her except that one day she happened to drop that the young gentleman was a jew a jew a young gentleman a person who did every thing by proxy and made a secret of all his motions here was abundant matter for the speculations and suspicions of gines he was confirmed in them without adverting to the process of his own mind by the subject of my lucubrationsâ€”men who died by the hand of the executioner he said little more to his brother except asking as if casually what sort of an old woman this was of what age she might be and whether she often brought him materials of this kind and soon after took occasion to leave him it was with vast pleasure that gines had listened to this unhopedfor information having collected from his brother sufficient hints relative to the person and appearance of mrs marney and understanding that he expected to receive something from me the next day gines took his stand in the street early that he might not risk miscarriage by negligence he waited several hours but not without success mrs marney came he watched her into the house and after about twenty minutes delay saw her return he dogged her from street to street observed her finally enter the door of a private house and congratulated himself upon having at length arrived at the consummation of his labours the house she entered was not her own habitation by a sort of miraculous accident she had observed gines following her in the street as she went home she saw a woman who had fallen down in a fainting fit moved by the compassion that was ever alive in her she approached her in order to render her assistance presently a crowd collected round them mrs marney having done what she was able once more proceeded homewards observing the crowd round her the idea of pickpockets occurred to her mind she put her hands to her sides and at the same time looked round upon the populace she had left the circle somewhat abruptly and gines who had been obliged to come nearer lest he should lose her in the confusion was at that moment standing exactly opposite to her his visage was of the most extraordinary kind habit had written the characters of malignant cunning and dauntless effrontery in every line of his face and mrs marney who was neither philosopher nor physiognomist was nevertheless struck this good woman like most persons of her notable character had a peculiar way of going home not through the open streets but by narrow lanes and alleys with intricate insertions and sudden turnings in one of these by some accident she once again caught a glance of her pursuer this circumstance together with the singularity of his appearance awakened her conjectures could he be following her it was the middle of the day and she could have no fears for herself but could this circumstance have any reference to me she recollected the precautions and secrecy i practised and had no doubt that i had reasons for what i did she recollected that she had always been upon her guard respecting me but had she been sufficiently so she thought that if she should be the means of any mischief to me she should be miserable for ever she determined therefore by way of precaution in case of the worst to call at a friends house and send me word of what had occurred having instructed her friend she went out immediately upon a visit to a person in the exactly opposite direction and desired her friend to proceed upon the errand to me five minutes after she left the house by this prudence she completely extricated me from the present danger meantime the intelligence that was brought me by no means ascertained the greatness of the peril for any thing i could discover in it the circumstance might be perfectly innocent and the fear solely proceed from the overcaution and kindness of this benevolent and excellent woman yet such was the misery of my situation i had no choice for this menace or no menace i was obliged to desert my habitation at a minutes warning taking with me nothing but what i could carry in my hand to see my generous benefactress no more to quit my little arrangements and provision and to seek once again in some forlorn retreat new projects and if of that i could have any rational hope a new friend i descended into the street with a heavy not an irresolute heart it was broad day i said persons are at this moment supposed to be roaming the street in search of me i must not trust to the chance of their pursuing one direction and i another i traversed half a dozen streets and then dropped into an obscure house of entertainment for persons of small expense in this house i took some refreshment passed several hours of active but melancholy thinking and at last procured a bed as soon however as it was dark i went out for this was indispensable to purchase the materials of a new disguise having adjusted it as well as i could during the night i left this asylum with the same precautions that i had employed in former instances  chapter x i procured a new lodging by some bias of the mind it may be gratifying itself with images of peril i inclined to believe that mrs marneys alarm had not been without foundation i was however unable to conjecture through what means danger had approached me and had therefore only the unsatisfactory remedy of redoubling my watch upon all my actions still i had the joint considerations pressing upon me of security and subsistence i had some small remains of the produce of my former industry but this was but small for my employer was in arrear with me and i did not choose in any method to apply to him for payment the anxieties of my mind in spite of all my struggles preyed upon my health i did not consider myself as in safety for an instant my appearance was wasted to a shadow and i started at every sound that was unexpected sometimes i was half tempted to resign myself into the hands of the law and brave its worst but resentment and indignation at those times speedily flowed back upon my mind and reanimated my perseverance i knew no better resource with respect to subsistence than that i had employed in the former instance of seeking some third person to stand between me and the disposal of my industry i might find an individual ready to undertake this office in my behalf but where should i find the benevolent soul of mrs marney the person i fixed upon was a mr spurrel a man who took in work from the watchmakers and had an apartment upon our second floor i examined him two or three times with irresolute glances as we passed upon the stairs before i would venture to accost him he observed this and at length kindly invited me into his apartment being seated he condoled with me upon my seeming bad health and the solitary mode of my living and wished to know whether he could be of any service to me from the first moment he saw me he had conceived an affection for me in my present disguise i appeared twisted and deformed and in other respects by no means an object of attraction but it seemed mr spurrel had lost an only son about six months before and i was the very picture of him if i had put off my counterfeited ugliness i should probably have lost all hold upon his affections he was now an old man as he observed just dropping into the grave and his son had been his only consolation the poor lad was always ailing but he had been a nurse to him and the more tending he required while he was alive the more he missed him now he was dead now he had not a friend nor any body that cared for him in the whole world if i pleased i should be instead of that son to him and he would treat me in all respects with the same attention and kindness i expressed my sense of these benevolent offers but told him that i should be sorry to be in any way burthensome to him my ideas at present led me to a private and solitary life and my chief difficulty was to reconcile this with some mode of earning necessary subsistence if he would condescend to lend me his assistance in smoothing this difficulty it would be the greatest benefit he could confer on me i added that my mind had always had a mechanical and industrious turn and that i did not doubt of soon mastering any craft to which i seriously applied myself i had not been brought up to any trade but if he would favour me with his instructions i would work with him as long as he pleased for a bare subsistence i knew that i was asking of him an extraordinary kindness but i was urged on the one hand by the most extreme necessity and encouraged on the other by the persuasiveness of his friendly professions the old man dropped some tears over my apparent distress and readily consented to every thing i proposed our agreement was soon made and i entered upon my functions accordingly my new friend was a man of a singular turn of mind love of money and a charitable officiousness of demeanour were his leading characteristics he lived in the most penurious manner and denied himself every indulgence i entitled myself almost immediately as he frankly acknowledged to some remuneration for my labours and accordingly he insisted upon my being paid he did not however as some persons would have done under the circumstance pay me the whole amount of my earnings but professed to subtract from them twenty per cent as an equitable consideration for instruction and commissionmoney in procuring me a channel for my industry yet he frequently shed tears over me was uneasy in every moment of our indispensable separation and exhibited perpetual tokens of attachment and fondness i found him a man of excellent mechanical contrivance and received considerable pleasure from his communications my own sources of information were various and he frequently expressed his wonder and delight in the contemplation of my powers as well of amusement as exertion thus i appeared to have attained a situation not less eligible than in my connection with mrs marney i was however still more unhappy my fits of despondence were deeper and of more frequent recurrence my health every day grew worse and mr spurrel was not without apprehensions that he should lose me as he before lost his only son i had not been long however in this new situation before an incident occurred which filled me with greater alarm and apprehension than ever i was walking out one evening after a long visitation of languor for an hours exercise and air when my ears were struck with two or three casual sounds from the mouth of a hawker who was bawling his wares i stood still to inform myself more exactly when to my utter astonishment and confusion i heard him deliver himself nearly in these words here you have the most wonderful and surprising history and miraculous adventures of caleb williams you are informed how he first robbed and then brought false accusations against his master as also of his attempting divers times to break out of prison till at last he effected his escape in the most wonderful and uncredible manner as also of his travelling the kingdom in various disguises and the robberies he committed with a most desperate and daring gang of thieves and of his coming up to london where it is supposed he now lies concealed with a true and faithful copy of the hue and cry printed and published by one of his majestys most principal secretaries of state offering a reward of one hundred guineas for apprehending him all for the price of one halfpenny petrified as i was at these amazing and dreadful sounds i had the temerity to go up to the man and purchase one of his papers i was desperately resolved to know the exact state of the fact and what i had to depend upon i carried it with me a little way till no longer able to endure the tumult of my impatience i contrived to make out the chief part of its contents by the help of a lamp at the upper end of a narrow passage i found it contain a greater number of circumstances than could have been expected in this species of publication i was equalled to the most notorious housebreaker in the art of penetrating through walls and doors and to the most accomplished swindler in plausibleness duplicity and disguise the handbill which larkins had first brought to us upon the forest was printed at length all my disguises previously to the last alarm that had been given me by the providence of mrs marney were faithfully enumerated and the public were warned to be upon their watch against a person of an uncouth and extraordinary appearance and who lived in a recluse and solitary manner i also learned from this paper that my former lodgings had been searched on the very evening of my escape and that mrs marney had been sent to newgate upon a charge of misprision of felonyâ€”this last circumstance affected me deeply in the midst of my own sufferings my sympathies flowed undiminished it was a most cruel and intolerable idea if i were not only myself to be an object of unrelenting persecution but my very touch were to be infectious and every one that succoured me was to be involved in the common ruin my instant feeling was that of a willingness to undergo the utmost malice of my enemies could i by that means have saved this excellent woman from alarm and perilâ€”i afterwards learned that mrs marney was delivered from confinement by the interposition of her noble relation my sympathy for mrs marney however was at this moment a transient one a more imperious and irresistible consideration demanded to be heard with what sensations did i ruminate upon this paper every word of it carried despair to my heart the actual apprehension that i dreaded would perhaps have been less horrible it would have put an end to that lingering terror to which i was a prey disguise was no longer of use a numerous class of individuals through every department almost every house of the metropolis would be induced to look with a suspicious eye upon every stranger especially every solitary stranger that fell under their observation the prize of one hundred guineas was held out to excite their avarice and sharpen their penetration it was no longer bowstreet it was a million of men in arms against me neither had i the refuge which few men have been so miserable as to want of one single individual with whom to repose my alarms and who might shelter me from the gaze of indiscriminate curiosity what could exceed the horrors of this situation my heart knocked against my ribs my bosom heaved i gasped and panted for breath there is no end then said i to my persecutors my unwearied and longcontinued labours lead to no termination termination no the lapse of time that cures all other things makes my case more desperate why then exclaimed i a new train of thought suddenly rushing into my mind why should i sustain the contest any longer i can at least elude my persecutors in death i can bury myself and the traces of my existence together in friendly oblivion and thus bequeath eternal doubt and ever new alarm to those who have no peace but in pursuing me in the midst of the horrors with which i was now impressed this idea gave me pleasure and i hastened to the thames to put it in instant execution such was the paroxysm of my mind that my powers of vision became partially suspended i was no longer conscious to the feebleness of disease but rushed along with fervent impetuosity i passed from street to street without observing what direction i pursued after wandering i know not how long i arrived at london bridge i hastened to the stairs and saw the river covered with vessels no human being must see me said i at the instant that i vanish for ever this thought required some consideration a portion of time had elapsed since my first desperate purpose my understanding began to return the sight of the vessels suggested to me the idea of once more attempting to leave my native country i enquired and speedily found that the cheapest passage i could procure was in a vessel moored near the tower and which was to sail in a few days for middleburgh in holland i would have gone instantly on board and have endeavoured to prevail with the captain to let me remain there till he sailed but unfortunately i had not money enough in my pocket to defray my passage it was worse than this i had not money enough in the world i however paid the captain half his demand and promised to return with the rest i knew not in what manner it was to be procured but i believed that i should not fail in it i had some idea of applying to mr spurrel surely he would not refuse me he appeared to love me with parental affection and i thought i might trust myself for a moment in his hands i approached my place of residence with a heavy and foreboding heart mr spurrel was not at home and i was obliged to wait for his return worn out with fatigue disappointment and the ill state of my health i sunk upon a chair speedily however i recollected myself i had work of mr spurrels in my trunk which had been delivered out to me that very morning to five times the amount i wanted i canvassed for a moment whether i should make use of this property as if it were my own but i rejected the idea with disdain i had never in the smallest degree merited the reproaches that were east upon me and i determined i never would merit them i sat gasping anxious full of the blackest forebodings my terrors appeared even to my own mind greater and more importunate than the circumstances authorised it was extraordinary that mr spurrel should be abroad at this hour i had never known it happen before his bedtime was between nine and ten ten oclock came eleven oclock but not mr spurrel at midnight i heard his knock at the door every soul in the house was in bed mr spurrel on account of his regular hours was unprovided with a key to open for himself a gleam a sickly gleam of the social spirit came over my heart i flew nimbly down stairs and opened the door i could perceive by the little taper in my hand something extraordinary in his countenance i had not time to speak before i saw two other men follow him at the first glance i was sufficiently assured what sort of persons they were at the second i perceived that one of them was no other than gines himself i had understood formerly that he had been of this profession and i was not surprised to find him in it again though i had for three hours endeavoured as it were to prepare myself for the unavoidable necessity of falling once again into the hands of the officers of law the sensation i felt at their entrance was indescribably agonising i was besides not a little astonished at the time and manner of their entrance and i felt anxious to know whether mr spurrel could be base enough to have been their introducer i was not long held in perplexity he no sooner saw his followers within the door than he exclaimed with convulsive eagerness there there that is your man thank god thank god gines looked eagerly in my face with a countenance expressive alternately of hope and doubt and answered by god and i do not know whether it be or no i am afraid we are in the wrong box then recollecting himself we will go into the house and examine further however we all went up stairs into mr spurrels room i set down the candle upon the table i had hitherto been silent but i determined not to desert myself and was a little encouraged to exertion by the scepticism of gines with a calm and deliberate manner therefore in my feigned voice one of the characteristics of which was lisping i asked pray gentlemen what may be your pleasure with meâ€”why said gines our errand is with one caleb williams and a precious rascal he is i ought to know the chap well enough but they say he has as many faces as there are days in the year so you please to pull off your face or if you cannot do that at least you can pull off your clothes and let us see what your hump is made of i remonstrated but in vain i stood detected in part of my artifice and gines though still uncertain was every moment more and more confirmed in his suspicions mr spurrel perfectly gloated with eyes that seemed ready to devour every thing that passed as my imposture gradually appeared more palpable he repeated his exclamation thank god thank god at last tired with this scene of mummery and disgusted beyond measure with the base and hypocritical figure i seemed to exhibit i exclaimed well i am caleb williams conduct me wherever you please and now mr spurrelâ€”he gave a violent start the instant i declared myself his transport had been at the highest and was to any power he was able to exert absolutely uncontrollable but the unexpectedness of my address and the tone in which i spoke electrified himâ€”is it possible continued i that you should have been the wretch to betray me what have i done to deserve this treatment is this the kindness you professed the affection that was perpetually in your mouth to be the death of me my poor boy my dear creature cried spurrel whimpering and in a tone of the humblest expostulation indeed i could not help it i would have helped it if i could i hope they will not hurt my darling i am sure i shall die if they do miserable driveller interrupted i with a stern voice do you betray me into the remorseless fangs of the law and then talk of my not being hurt i know my sentence and am prepared to meet it you have fixed the halter upon my neck and at the same price would have done so to your only son go count your accursed guineas my life would have been safer in the hands of one i had never seen than in yours whose mouth and whose eyes for ever ran over with crocodile affection i have always believed that my sickness and as he apprehended approaching death contributed its part to the treachery of mr spurrel he predicted to his own mind the time when i should no longer be able to work he recollected with agony the expense that attended his sons illness and death he determined to afford me no assistance of a similar kind he feared however the reproach of deserting me he feared the tenderness of his nature he felt that i was growing upon his affections and that in a short time he could not have deserted me he was driven by a sort of implicit impulse for the sake of avoiding one ungenerous action to take refuge in another the basest and most diabolical this motive conjoining with the prospect of the proffered reward was an incitement too powerful for him to resist  chapter xi having given vent to my resentment i left mr spurrel motionless and unable to utter a word gines and his companion attended me it is unnecessary to repeat all the insolence of this man he alternately triumphed in the completion of his revenge and regretted the loss of the reward to the shrivelled old curmudgeon we had just quitted whom however he swore he would cheat of it by one means or another he claimed to himself the ingenuity of having devised the halfpenny legend the thought of which was all his own and was an expedient that was impossible to fail there was neither law nor justice he said to be had if hunks who had done nothing were permitted to pocket the cash and his merit were left undistinguished and pennyless i paid but little attention to his story it struck upon my sense and i was able to recollect it at my nearest leisure though i thought not of it at the time for the present i was busily employed reflecting on my new situation and the conduct to be observed in it the thought of suicide had twice in moments of uncommon despair suggested itself to my mind but it was far from my habitual meditations at present and in all cases where death was immediately threatened me from the injustice of others i felt myself disposed to contend to the last my prospects were indeed sufficiently gloomy and discouraging how much labour had i exerted first to extricate myself from prison and next to evade the diligence of my pursuers and the result of all to be brought back to the point from which i began i had gained fame indeed the miserable fame to have my story bawled forth by hawkers and balladmongers to have my praises as an active and enterprising villain celebrated among footmen and chambermaids but i was neither an erostratus nor an alexander to die contented with that species of eulogium with respect to all that was solid what chance could i find in new exertions of a similar nature never was a human creature pursued by enemies more inventive or envenomed i could have small hope that they would ever cease their persecution or that my future attempts would be crowned with a more desirable issue they were considerations like these that dictated my resolution my mind had been gradually weaning from mr falkland till its feeling rose to something like abhorrence i had long cherished a reverence for him which not even animosity and subornation on his part could utterly destroy but i now ascribed a character so inhumanly sanguinary to his mind i saw something so fiendlike in the thus hunting me round the world and determining to be satisfied with nothing less than my blood while at the same time he knew my innocence my indisposition to mischief nay i might add my virtues that henceforth i trampled reverence and the recollection of former esteem under my feet i lost all regard to his intellectual greatness and all pity for the agonies of his soul i also would abjure forbearance i would show myself bitter and inflexible as he had done was it wise in him to drive me into extremity and madness had he no fears for his own secret and atrocious offences i had been obliged to spend the remainder of the night upon which i had been apprehended in prison during the interval i had thrown off every vestige of disguise and appeared the next morning in my own person i was of course easily identified and this being the whole with which the magistrates before whom i now stood thought themselves concerned they were proceeding to make out an order for my being conducted back to my own county i suspended the despatch of this measure by observing that i had something to disclose this is an overture to which men appointed for the administration of criminal justice never fail to attend i went before the magistrates to whose office gines and his comrade conducted me fully determined to publish those astonishing secrets of which i had hitherto been the faithful depository and once for all to turn the tables upon my accuser it was time that the real criminal should be the sufferer and not that innocence should for ever labour under the oppression of guilt i said that i had always protested my innocence and must now repeat the protest in that case retorted the senior magistrate abruptly what can you have to disclose if you are innocent that is no business of ours we act officially i always declared continued i that i was the perpetrator of no guilt but that the guilt wholly belonged to my accuser he privately conveyed these effects among my property and then charged me with the robbery i now declare more than that that this man is a murderer that i detected his criminality and that for that reason he is determined to deprive me of life i presume gentlemen that you do consider it as your business to take this declaration i am persuaded you will be by no means disposed actively or passively to contribute to the atrocious injustice under which i suffer to the imprisonment and condemnation of an innocent man in order that a murderer may go free i suppressed this story as long as i could i was extremely averse to be the author of the unhappiness or the death of a human being but all patience and submission have their limits give me leave sir rejoined the magistrate with an air of affected moderation to ask you two questions were you any way aiding abetting or contributing to this murder no and pray sir who is this mr falkland and what may have been the nature of your connection with him mr falkland is a gentleman of six thousand per annum i lived with him as his secretary in other words you were his servant as you please very well sir that is quite enough for me first i have to tell you as a magistrate that i can have nothing to do with your declaration if you had been concerned in the murder you talk of that would alter the case but it is out of all reasonable rule for a magistrate to take an information from a felon except against his accomplices next i think it right to observe to you in my own proper person that you appear to me to be the most impudent rascal i ever saw why are you such an ass as to suppose that the sort of story you have been telling can be of any service to you either here or at the assizes or any where else a fine time of it indeed it would be if when gentlemen of six thousand a year take up their servants for robbing them those servants could trump up such accusations as these and could get any magistrate or court of justice to listen to them whether or no the felony with which you stand charged would have brought you to the gallows i will not pretend to say but i am sure this story will there would be a speedy end to all order and good government if fellows that trample upon ranks and distinctions in this atrocious sort were upon any consideration suffered to get off and do you refuse sir to attend to the particulars of the charge i allege yes sir i doâ€”but if i did not pray what witnesses have you of the murder this question staggered me none but i believe i can make out a circumstantial proof of a nature to force attention from the most indifferent hearer so i thoughtâ€”officers take him from the bar such was the success of this ultimate resort on my part upon which i had built with such undoubting confidence till now i had conceived that the unfavourable situation in which i was placed was prolonged by my own forbearance and i had determined to endure all that human nature could support rather than have recourse to this extreme recrimination that idea secretly consoled me under all my calamities it was a voluntary sacrifice and was cheerfully made i thought myself allied to the army of martyrs and confessors i applauded my fortitude and selfdenial and i pleased myself with the idea that i had the power though i hoped never to employ it by an unrelenting display of my resources to put an end at once to my sufferings and persecutions and this at last was the justice of mankind a man under certain circumstances shall not be heard in the detection of a crime because he has not been a participator of it the story of a flagitious murder shall be listened to with indifference while an innocent man is hunted like a wild beast to the furthest corners of the earth six thousand a year shall protect a man from accusation and the validity of an impeachment shall be superseded because the author of it is a servant i was conducted back to the very prison from which a few months before i had made my escape with a bursting heart i entered those walls compelled to feel that all my more than herculean labours served for my own torture and for no other end since my escape from prison i had acquired some knowledge of the world i had learned by bitter experience by how many links society had a hold upon me and how closely the snares of despotism beset me i no longer beheld the world as my youthful fancy had once induced me to do as a scene in which to hide or to appear and to exhibit the freaks of a wanton vivacity i saw my whole species as ready in one mode or other to be made the instruments of the tyrant hope died away in the bottom of my heart shut up for the first night in my dungeon i was seized at intervals with temporary frenzy from time to time i rent the universal silence with the roarings of unsupportable despair but this was a transient distraction i soon returned to the sober recollection of myself and my miseries my prospects were more gloomy and my situation apparently more irremediable than ever i was exposed again if that were of any account to the insolence and tyranny that are uniformly exercised within those walls why should i repeat the loathsome tale of all that was endured by me and is endured by every man who is unhappy enough to fall under the government of these consecrated ministers of national jurisprudence the sufferings i had already experienced my anxieties my flight the perpetual expectation of being discovered worse than the discovery itself would perhaps have been enough to satisfy the most insensible individual in the court of his own conscience if i had even been the felon i was pretended to be but the law has neither eyes nor ears nor bowels of humanity and it turns into marble the hearts of all those that are nursed in its principles i however once more recovered my spirit of determination i resolved that while i had life i would never be deserted by this spirit oppressed annihilated i might be but if i died i would die resisting what use what advantage what pleasurable sentiment could arise from a tame surrender there is no man that is ignorant that to humble yourself at the feet of the law is a bootless task in her courts there is no room for amendment and reformation my fortitude may to some persons appear above the standard of human nature but if i draw back the veil from my heart they will readily confess their mistake my heart bled at every pore my resolution was not the calm sentiment of philosophy and reason it was a gloomy and desperate purpose the creature not of hope but of a mind austerely held to its design that felt as it were satisfied with the naked effort and prepared to give success or miscarriage to the winds it was to this miserable condition which might awaken sympathy in the most hardened bosom that mr falkland had reduced me in the mean time strange as it may seem here in prison subject to innumerable hardships and in the assured expectation of a sentence of death i recovered my health i ascribe this to the state of my mind which was now changed from perpetual anxiety terror and alarm the too frequent inmates of a prison but which i upon this occasion did not seem to bring along with me to a desperate firmness i anticipated the event of my trial i determined once more to escape from my prison nor did i doubt of my ability to effect at least this first step towards my future preservation the assizes however were near and there were certain considerations unnecessary to be detailed that persuaded me there might be benefit in waiting till my trial should actually be terminated before i made my attempt it stood upon the list as one of the latest to be brought forward i was therefore extremely surprised to find it called out of its order early on the morning of the second day but if this were unexpected how much greater was my astonishment when my prosecutor was called to find neither mr falkland nor mr forester nor a single individual of any description appear against me the recognizances into which my prosecutors had entered were declared to be forfeited and i was dismissed without further impediment from the bar the effect which this incredible reverse produced upon my mind it is impossible to express i who had come to that bar with the sentence of death already in idea ringing in my ears to be told that i was free to transport myself whithersoever i pleased was it for this that i had broken through so many locks and bolts and the adamantine walls of my prison that i had passed so many anxious days and sleepless spectrehaunted nights that i had racked my invention for expedients of evasion and concealment that my mind had been roused to an energy of which i could scarcely have believed it capable that my existence had been enthralled to an everliving torment such as i could scarcely have supposed it in man to endure great god what is man is he thus blind to the future thus totally unsuspecting of what is to occur in the next moment of his existence i have somewhere read that heaven in mercy hides from us the future incidents of our life my own experience does not well accord with this assertion in this instance at least i should have been saved from insupportable labour and undescribable anguish could i have foreseen the catastrophe of this most interesting transaction  chapter xii it was not long before i took my everlasting leave of this detested and miserable scene my heart was for the present too full of astonishment and exultation in my unexpected deliverance to admit of anxiety about the future i withdrew from the town i rambled with a slow and thoughtful pace now bursting with exclamation and now buried in profound and undefinable reverie accident led me towards the very heath which had first sheltered me when upon a former occasion i broke out of my prison i wandered among its cavities and its valleys it was a forlorn and desolate solitude i continued here i know not how long night at length overtook me unperceived and i prepared to return for the present to the town i had quitted it was now perfectly dark when two men whom i had not previously observed sprung upon me from behind they seized me by the arms and threw me upon the ground i had no time for resistance or recollection i could however perceive that one of them was the diabolical gines they blindfolded gagged me and hurried me i knew not whither as we passed along in silence i endeavoured to conjecture what could be the meaning of this extraordinary violence i was strongly impressed with the idea that after the event of this morning the most severe and painful part of my history was past and strange as it may seem i could not persuade myself to regard with alarm this unexpected attack it might however be some new project suggested by the brutal temper and unrelenting animosity of gines i presently found that we were returned into the town i had just quitted they led me into a house and as soon as they had taken possession of a room freed me from the restraints they had before imposed here gines informed me with a malicious grin that no harm was intended me and therefore i should show most sense in keeping myself quiet i perceived that we were in an inn i overheard company in a room at no great distance from us and therefore was now as thoroughly aware as he could be that there was at present little reason to stand in fear of any species of violence and that it would be time enough to resist when they attempted to conduct me from the inn in the same manner that they had brought me into it i was not without some curiosity to see the conclusion that was to follow upon so extraordinary a commencement the preliminaries i have described were scarcely completed before mr falkland entered the room i remember collins when he first communicated to me the particulars of our patrons history observed that he was totally unlike the man he had once been i had no means of ascertaining the truth of that observation but it was strikingly applicable to the spectacle which now presented itself to my eyes though when i last beheld this unhappy man he had been a victim to the same passions a prey to the same undying remorse as now misery was at that time inscribed in legible characters upon his countenance but now he appeared like nothing that had ever been visible in human shape his visage was haggard emaciated and fleshless his complexion was a dun and tarnished red the colour uniform through every region of the face and suggested the idea of its being burnt and parched by the eternal fire that burned within him his eyes were red quick wandering full of suspicion and rage his hair was neglected ragged and floating his whole figure was thin to a degree that suggested the idea rather of a skeleton than a person actually alive life seemed hardly to be the capable inhabitant of so woebegone and ghostlike a figure the taper of wholesome life was expired but passion and fierceness and frenzy were able for the present to supply its place i was to the utmost degree astonished and shocked at the sight of himâ€”he sternly commanded my conductors to leave the room well sir i have this day successfully exerted myself to save your life from the gallows a fortnight ago you did what you were able to bring my life to that ignominious close were you so stupid and undistinguishing as not to know that the preservation of your life was the uniform object of my exertions did not i maintain you in prison did not i endeavour to prevent your being sent thither could you mistake the bigoted and obstinate conduct of forester in offering a hundred guineas for your apprehension for mine i had my eye upon you in all your wanderings you have taken no material step through their whole course with which i have not been acquainted i meditated to do you good i have spilt no blood but that of tyrrel that was in the moment of passion and it has been the subject of my uninterrupted and hourly remorse i have connived at no mans fate but that of the hawkinses they could no otherwise have been saved than by my acknowledging myself a murderer the rest of my life has been spent in acts of benevolence i meditated to do you good for that reason i was willing to prove you you pretended to act towards me with consideration and forbearance if you had persisted in that to the end i would yet have found a way to reward you i left you to your own discretion you might show the impotent malignity of your own heart but in the circumstances in which you were then placed i knew you could not hurt me your forbearance has proved as i all along suspected empty and treacherous you have attempted to blast my reputation you have sought to disclose the select and eternal secret of my soul because you have done that i will never forgive you i will remember it to my latest breath the memory shall survive me when my existence is no more do you think you are out of the reach of my power because a court of justice has acquitted you while mr falkland was speaking a sudden distemper came over his countenance his whole frame was shaken by an instantaneous convulsion and he staggered to a chair in about three minutes he recovered yes said he i am still alive i shall live for days and months and years the power that made me of whatever kind it be can only determine how long i live the guardian of my reputation that and to endure a misery such as man never endured are the only ends to which i live but when i am no more my fame shall still survive my character shall be revered as spotless and unimpeachable by all posterity as long as the name of falkland shall be repeated in the most distant regions of the manypeopled globe having said this he returned to the discourse which more immediately related to my future condition and happiness there is one condition said he upon which you may obtain some mitigation of your future calamity it is for that purpose that i have sent for you listen to my proposal with deliberation and sobriety remember that the insanity is not less to trifle with the resolved determination of my soul than it would be to pull a mountain upon your head that hung trembling upon the edge of the mighty apennine i insist then upon your signing a paper declaring in the most solemn manner that i am innocent of murder and that the charge you alleged at the office in bowstreet is false malicious and groundless perhaps you may scruple out of a regard to truth is truth then entitled to adoration for its own sake and not for the sake of the happiness it is calculated to produce will a reasonable man sacrifice to barren truth when benevolence humanity and every consideration that is dear to the human heart require that it should be superseded it is probable that i may never make use of this paper but i require it as the only practicable reparation to the honour you have assailed this is what i had to propose i expect your answer sir answered i i have heard you to an end and i stand in need of no deliberation to enable me to answer you in the negative you took me up a raw and inexperienced boy capable of being moulded to any form you pleased but you have communicated to me volumes of experience in a very short period i am no longer irresolute and pliable what is the power you retain over my fate i am unable to discover you may destroy me but you cannot make me tremble i am not concerned to enquire whether what i have suffered flowed from you by design or otherwise whether you were the author of my miseries or only connived at them this i know that i have suffered too exquisitely on your account for me to feel the least remaining claim on your part to my making any voluntary sacrifice you say that benevolence and humanity require this sacrifice of me no it would only be a sacrifice to your mad and misguided love of fameâ€”to that passion which has been the source of all your miseries of the most tragical calamities to others and of every misfortune that has happened to me i have no forbearance to exercise towards that passion if you be not yet cured of this tremendous and sanguinary folly at least i will do nothing to cherish it i know not whether from my youth i was destined for a hero but i may thank you for having taught me a lesson of insurmountable fortitude what is it that you require of me that i should sign away my own reputation for the better maintaining of yours where is the equality of that what is it that casts me at such an immense distance below you as to make every thing that relates to me wholly unworthy of consideration you have been educated in the prejudice of birth i abhor that prejudice you have made me desperate and i utter what that desperation suggests you will tell me perhaps that i have no reputation to lose that while you are esteemed faultless and unblemished i am universally reputed a thief a suborner and a calumniator be it so i will never do any thing to countenance those imputations the more i am destitute of the esteem of mankind the more careful i will be to preserve my own i will never from fear or any other mistaken motive do any thing of which i ought to be ashamed you are determined to be for ever my enemy i have in no degree deserved this eternal abhorrence i have always esteemed and pitied you for a considerable time i rather chose to expose myself to every kind of misfortune than disclose the secret that was so dear to you i was not deterred by your menacesâ€”what could you make me suffer more than i actually sufferedâ€”but by the humanity of my own heart in which and not in means of violence you ought to have reposed your confidence what is the mysterious vengeance that you can yet execute against me you menaced me before you can menace no worse now you are wearing out the springs of terror do with me as you please you teach me to hear you with an unshrinking and desperate firmness recollect yourself i did not proceed to the step with which you reproach me till i was apparently urged to the very last extremity i had suffered as much as human nature can suffer i had lived in the midst of eternal alarm and unintermitted watchfulness i had twice been driven to purposes of suicide i am now sorry however that the step of which you complain was ever adopted but urged to exasperation by an unintermitted rigour i had no time to cool or to deliberate even at present i cherish no vengeance against you all that is reasonable all that can really contribute to your security i will readily concede but i will not be driven to an act repugnant to all reason integrity and justice mr falkland listened to me with astonishment and impatience he had entertained no previous conception of the firmness i displayed several times he was convulsed with the fury that laboured in his breast once and again he betrayed an intention to interrupt but he was restrained by the collectedness of my manner and perhaps by a desire to be acquainted with the entire state of my mind finding that i had concluded he paused for a moment his passion seemed gradually to enlarge till it was no longer capable of control it is well said he gnashing his teeth and stamping upon the ground you refuse the composition i offer i have no power to persuade you to compliance you defy me at least i have a power respecting you and that power i will exercise a power that shall grind you into atoms i condescend to no more expostulation i know what i am and what i can be i know what you are and what fate is reserved for you saying this he quitted the room such were the particulars of this memorable scene the impression it has left upon my understanding is indelible the figure and appearance of mr falkland his deathlike weakness and decay his more than mortal energy and rage the words that he spoke the motives that animated him produced one compounded effect upon my mind that nothing of the same nature could ever parallel the idea of his misery thrilled through my frame how weak in comparison of it is the imaginary hell which the great enemy of mankind is represented as carrying every where about with him from this consideration my mind presently turned to the menaces he had vented against myself they were all mysterious and undefined he had talked of power but had given no hint from which i could collect in what he imagined it to consist he had talked of misery but had not dropped a syllable respecting the nature of the misery to be inflicted i sat still for some time ruminating on these thoughts neither mr falkland nor any other person appeared to disturb my meditations i rose went out of the room and from the inn into the street no one offered to molest me it was strange what was the nature of this power from which i was to apprehend so much yet which seemed to leave me at perfect liberty i began to imagine that all i had heard from this dreadful adversary was mere madness and extravagance and that he was at length deprived of the use of reason which had long served him only as a medium of torment yet was it likely in that case that he should be able to employ gines and his associate who had just been his instruments of violence upon my person i proceeded along the streets with considerable caution i looked before me and behind me as well as the darkness would allow me to do that i might not again be hunted in sight by some men of stratagem and violence without my perceiving it i went not as before beyond the limits of the town but considered the streets the houses and the inhabitants as affording some degree of security i was still walking with my mind thus full of suspicion and forecast when i discovered thomas that servant of mr falkland whom i have already more than once had occasion to mention he advanced towards me with an air so blunt and direct as instantly to remove from me the idea of any thing insidious in his purpose besides that i had always felt the character of thomas rustic and uncultivated as it was to be entitled to a more than common portion of esteem thomas said i as he advanced i hope you are willing to give me joy that i am at length delivered from the dreadful danger which for many months haunted me so unmercifully no rejoined thomas roughly i be not at all willing i do not know what to make of myself in this affair while you were in prison in that miserable fashion i felt all at one almost as if i loved you and now that that is over and you are turned out loose in the world to do your worst my blood rises at the very sight of you to look at you you are almost that very lad williams for whom i could with pleasure as it were have laid down my life and yet behind that smiling face there lie robbery and lying and every thing that is ungrateful and murderous your last action was worse than all the rest how could you find in your heart to revive that cruel story about mr tyrrel which every body had agreed out of regard to the squire never to mention again and of which i know and you know he is as innocent as the child unborn there are causes and reasons or else i could have wished from the bottom of my soul never to have set eyes on you again and you still persist in your hard thoughts of me worse i think worse of you than ever before i thought you as bad as man could be i wonder from my soul what you are to do next but you make good the old saying needs must go that the devil drives and so there is never to be an end of my misfortunes what can mr falkland contrive for me worse than the ill opinion and enmity of all mankind mr falkland contrive he is the best friend you have in the world though you are the basest traitor to him poor man it makes ones heart ache to look at him he is the very image of grief and it is not clear to me that it is not all owing to you at least you have given the finishing lift to the misfortune that was already destroying him there have been the devil and all to pay between him and squire forester the squire is right raving mad with my master for having outwitted him in the matter of the trial and saved your life he swears that you shall be taken up and tried all over again at the next assizes but my master is resolute and i believe will carry it his own way he says indeed that the law will not allow squire forester to have his will in this to see him ordering every thing for your benefit and taking all your maliciousness as mild and innocent as a lamb and to think of your vile proceedings against him is a sight one shall not see again go all the world over for gods sake repent of your reprobate doings and make what little reparation is in your power think of your poor soul before you awake as to be sure one of these days you will in fire and brimstone everlasting saying this he held out his hand and took hold of mine the action seemed strange but i at first thought it the unpremeditated result of his solemn and wellintended adjuration i felt however that he put something into my hand the next moment he quitted his hold and hastened from me with the swiftness of an arrow what he had thus given me was a banknote of twenty pounds i had no doubt that he had been charged to deliver it to me from mr falkland what was i to infer what light did it throw upon the intentions of my inexorable persecutor his animosity against me was as great as ever that i had just had confirmed to me from his own mouth yet his animosity appeared to be still tempered with the remains of humanity he prescribed to it a line wide enough to embrace the gratification of his views and within the boundaries of that line it stopped but this discovery carried no consolation to my mind i knew not what portion of calamity i was fated to endure before his jealousy of dishonour and inordinate thirst of fame would deem themselves satisfied another question offered itself was i to receive the money which had just been put into my hands the money of a man who had inflicted upon me injuries less than those which he had entailed upon himself but the greatest that one man can inflict upon another who had blasted my youth who had destroyed my peace who had held me up to the abhorrence of mankind and rendered me an outcast upon the face of the earth who had forced the basest and most atrocious falsehoods and urged them with a seriousness and perseverance which produced universal belief who an hour before had vowed against me inexorable enmity and sworn to entail upon me misery without end would not this conduct on my part betray a base and abject spirit that crouched under tyranny and kissed the hands that were imbrued in my blood if these reasons appeared strong neither was the other side without reasons in reply i wanted the money not for any purpose of vice or superfluity but for those purposes without which life cannot subsist man ought to be able wherever placed to find for himself the means of existence but i was to open a new scene of life to remove to some distant spot to be prepared against all the illwill of mankind and the unexplored projects of hostility of a most accomplished foe the actual means of existence are the property of all what should hinder me from taking that of which i was really in want when in taking it i risked no vengeance and perpetrated no violence the property in question will be beneficial to me and the voluntary surrender of it is accompanied with no injury to its late proprietor what other condition can be necessary to render the use of it on my part a duty he that lately possessed it has injured me does that alter its value as a medium of exchange he will boast perhaps of the imaginary obligation he has conferred on me surely to shrink from a thing in itself right from any such apprehension can be the result only of pusillanimity and cowardice  chapter xiii influenced by these reasonings i determined to retain what had thus been put into my hands my next care was in regard to the scene i should choose as the retreat of that life which i had just saved from the grasp of the executioner the danger to which i was exposed of forcible interruption in my pursuits was probably in some respects less now than it had been previously to this crisis besides that i was considerably influenced in this deliberation by the strong loathing i conceived for the situations in which i had lately been engaged i knew not in what mode mr falkland intended to exercise his vengeance against me but i was seized with so unconquerable an aversion to disguise and the idea of spending my life in personating a fictitious character that i could not for the present at least reconcile my mind to any thing of that nature the same kind of disgust i had conceived for the metropolis where i had spent so many hours of artifice sadness and terror i therefore decided in favour of the project which had formerly proved amusing to my imagination of withdrawing to some distant rural scene a scene of calmness and obscurity where for a few years at least perhaps during the life of mr falkland i might be hidden from the world recover the wounds my mind had received in this fatal connection methodise and improve the experience which had been accumulated cultivate the faculties i in any degree possessed and employ the intervals of these occupations in simple industry and the intercourse of guileless uneducated kindintentioned minds the menaces of my persecutor seemed to forebode the inevitable interruption of this system but i deemed it wise to put these menaces out of my consideration i compared them to death which must infallibly overtake us we know not when but the possibility of whose arrival next year next week tomorrow must be left out of the calculation of him who would enter upon any important or wellconcerted undertaking such were the ideas that determined my choice thus did my youthful mind delineate the system of distant years even when the threats of instant calamity still sounded in my ears i was inured to the apprehension of mischief till at last the hoarse roarings of the beginning tempest had lost their power of annihilating my peace i however thought it necessary while i was most palpably within the sphere of the enemy to exert every practicable degree of vigilance i was careful not to incur the hazards of darkness and solitude when i left the town it was with the stagecoach an obvious source of protection against glaring and enormous violence meanwhile i found myself no more exposed to molestation in my progress than the man in the world who should have had the least reason for apprehensions of this nature as the distance increased i relaxed something in my precaution though still awake to a sense of danger and constantly pursued with the image of my foe i fixed upon an obscure markettown in wales as the chosen seat of my operations this place recommended itself to my observation as i was wandering in quest of an abode it was clean cheerful and of great simplicity of appearance it was at a distance from any public and frequented road and had nothing which could deserve the name of trade the face of nature around it was agreeably diversified being partly wild and romantic and partly rich and abundant in production here i solicited employment in two professions the first that of a watchmaker in which though the instructions i had received were few they were eked out and assisted by a mind fruitful in mechanical invention the other that of an instructor in mathematics and its practical application geography astronomy landsurveying and navigation neither of these was a very copious source of emolument in the obscure retreat i had chosen for myself but if my receipts were slender my disbursements were still fewer in this little town i became acquainted with the vicar the apothecary the lawyer and the rest of the persons who time out of mind had been regarded as the top gentry of the place each of these centred in himself a variety of occupations there was little in the appearance of the vicar that reminded you of his profession except on the recurring sunday at other times he condescended with his evangelical hand to guide the plough or to drive the cows from the field to the farmyard for the milking the apothecary occasionally officiated as a barber and the lawyer was the village schoolmaster by all these persons i was received with kindness and hospitality among people thus remote from the bustle of human life there is an open spirit of confidence by means of which a stranger easily finds access to their benevolence and goodwill my manners had never been greatly debauched from the simplicity of rural life by the scenes through which i had passed and the hardships i had endured had given additional mildness to my character in the theatre upon which i was now placed i had no rival my mechanical occupation had hitherto been a nonresident and the schoolmaster who did not aspire to the sublime heights of science i professed to communicate was willing to admit me as a partner in the task of civilising the unpolished manners of the inhabitants for the parson civilisation was no part of his trade his business was with the things of a better life not with the carnal concerns of this material scene in truth his thoughts were principally occupied with his oatmeal and his cows these however were not the only companions which this remote retirement afforded me there was a family of a very different description of which i gradually became the chosen intimate the father was a shrewd sensible rational man but who had turned his principal attention to subjects of agriculture his wife was a truly admirable and extraordinary woman she was the daughter of a neapolitan nobleman who after having visited and made a considerable figure in every country in europe had at length received the blow of fate in this village he had been banished his country upon suspicion of religious and political heresy and his estates confiscated with this only child like prospero in the tempest he had withdrawn himself to one of the most obscure and uncultivated regions of the world very soon however after his arrival in wales he had been seized with a malignant fever which carried him off in three days he died possessed of no other property than a few jewels and a bill of credit to no considerable amount upon an english banker here then was the infant laura left in a foreign country and without a single friend the father of her present husband was led by motives of pure humanity to seek to mitigate the misfortunes of the dying italian though a plain uninstructed man with no extraordinary refinement of intellect there was something in his countenance that determined the stranger in his present forlorn and melancholy situation to make him his executor and the guardian of his daughter the neapolitan understood enough of english to explain his wishes to this friendly attendant of his deathbed as his circumstances were narrow the servants of the stranger two italians a male and a female were sent back to their own country soon after the death of their master laura was at this time eight years of age at these tender years she had been susceptible of little direct instruction and as she grew up even the memory of her father became from year to year more vague and indistinct in her mind but there was something she derived from her father whether along with the life he bestowed or as the consequence of his instruction and manners which no time could efface every added year of her life contributed to develop the fund of her accomplishments she read she observed she reflected without instructors she taught herself to draw to sing and to understand the more polite european languages as she had no society in this remote situation but that of peasants she had no idea of honour or superiority to be derived from her acquisitions but pursued them from a secret taste and as the sources of personal enjoyment a mutual attachment gradually arose between her and the only son of her guardian his father led him from early youth to the labours and the sports of the field and there was little congeniality between his pursuits and those of laura but this was a defect that she was slow to discover she had never been accustomed to society in her chosen amusements and habit at that time even made her conceive that they were indebted to solitude for an additional relish the youthful rustic had great integrity great kindness of heart and was a lad of excellent sense he was florid wellproportioned and the goodness of his disposition made his manners amiable accomplishments greater than these she had never seen in human form since the death of her father in fact she is scarcely to be considered as a sufferer in this instance since in her forlorn and destitute condition it is little probable when we consider the habits and notions that now prevail that her accomplishments unassisted by fortune would have procured her an equal alliance in marriage when she became a mother her heart opened to a new affection the idea now presented itself which had never occurred before that in her children at least she might find the partners and companions of her favourite employments she was at the time of my arrival mother of four the eldest of which was a son to all of them she had been a most assiduous instructor it was well for her perhaps that she obtained this sphere for the exercise of her mind it came just at the period when the charm which human life derives from novelty is beginning to wear off it gave her new activity and animation it is perhaps impossible that the refinements of which human nature is capable should not after a time subside into sluggishness if they be not aided by the influence of society and affection the son of the welch farmer by this admirable woman was about seventeen years of age at the time of my settlement in their neighbourhood his eldest sister was one year younger than himself the whole family composed a group with which a lover of tranquillity and virtue would have delighted to associate in any situation it is easy therefore to conceive how much i rejoiced in their friendship in this distant retirement and suffering as i felt myself from the maltreatment and desertion of my species the amiable laura had a wonderful quickness of eye and rapidity of apprehension but this feature in her countenance was subdued by a sweetness of disposition such as i never in any other instance saw expressed in the looks of a human being she soon distinguished me by her kindness and friendship for living as she had done though familiar with the written productions of a cultivated intellect she had never seen the thing itself realised in a living being except in the person of her father she delighted to converse with me upon subjects of literature and taste and she eagerly invited my assistance in the education of her children the son though young had been so happily improved and instructed by his mother that i found in him nearly all the most essential qualities we require in a friend engagement and inclination equally led me to pass a considerable part of every day in this agreeable society laura treated me as if i had been one of the family and i sometimes flattered myself that i might one day become such in reality what an enviable restingplace for me who had known nothing but calamity and had scarcely dared to look for sympathy and kindness in the countenance of a human being the sentiments of friendship which early disclosed themselves between me and the member of this amiable family daily became stronger at every interview the confidence reposed in me by the mother increased while our familiarity gained in duration it equally gained in that subtlety of communication by which it seemed to shoot forth its roots in every direction there are a thousand little evanescent touches in the development of a growing friendship that are neither thought of nor would be understood between common acquaintances i honoured and esteemed the respectable laura like a mother for though the difference of our ages was by no means sufficient to authorise the sentiment it was irresistibly suggested to me by the fact of her always being presented to my observation under the maternal character her son was a lad of great understanding generosity and feeling and of no contemptible acquirements while his tender years and the uncommon excellence of his mother subtracted something from the independence of his judgment and impressed him with a sort of religious deference for her will in the eldest daughter i beheld the image of laura for that i felt attached to her for the present and i sometimes conceived it probable that hereafter i might learn to love her for her own sakeâ€”alas it was thus that i amused myself with the visions of distant years while i stood in reality on the brink of the precipice it will perhaps be thought strange that i never once communicated the particulars of my story to this amiable matron or to my young friend for such i may also venture to call him her son but in truth i abhorred the memory of this story i placed all my hopes of happiness in the prospect of its being consigned to oblivion i fondly flattered myself that such would be the event in the midst of my unlookedfor happiness i scarcely recollected or recollecting was disposed to yield but a small degree of credit to the menaces of mr falkland one day that i was sitting alone with the accomplished laura she repeated his alldreadful name i started with astonishment amazed that a woman like this who knew nobody who lived as it were alone in a corner of the universe who had never in a single instance entered into any fashionable circle this admirable and fascinating hermit should by some unaccountable accident have become acquainted with this fatal and tremendous name astonishment however was not my only sensation i became pale with terror i rose from my seat i attempted to sit down again i reeled out of the room and hastened to bury myself in solitude the unexpectedness of the incident took from me all precaution and overwhelmed my faculties the penetrating laura observed my behaviour but nothing further occurred to excite her attention to it at that time and concluding from my manner that enquiry would be painful to me she humanely suppressed her curiosity i afterwards found that mr falkland had been known to the father of laura that he had been acquainted with the story of count malvesi and with a number of other transactions redounding in the highest degree to the credit of the gallant englishman the neapolitan had left letters in which these transactions were recorded and which spoke of mr falkland in the highest terms of panegyric laura had been used to regard every little relic of her father with a sort of religious veneration and by this accident the name of mr falkland was connected in her mind with the sentiments of unbounded esteem the scene by which i was surrounded was perhaps more grateful to me than it would have been to most other persons with my degree of intellectual cultivation sore with persecution and distress and bleeding at almost every vein there was nothing i so much coveted as rest and tranquillity it seemed as if my faculties were at least for the time exhausted by the late preternatural intensity of their exertions and that they stood indispensably in need of a period of comparative suspension this was however but a temporary feeling my mind had always been active and i was probably indebted to the sufferings i had endured and the exquisite and increased susceptibility they produced for new energies i soon felt the desire of some additional and vigorous pursuit in this state of mind i met by accident in a neglected corner of the house of one of my neighbours with a general dictionary of four of the northern languages this incident gave a direction to my thoughts in my youth i had not been inattentive to languages i determined to attempt at least for my own use an etymological analysis of the english language i easily perceived that this pursuit had one advantage to a person in my situation and that a small number of books consulted with this view would afford employment for a considerable time i procured other dictionaries in my incidental reading i noted the manner in which words were used and applied these remarks to the illustration of my general enquiry i was unintermitted in my assiduity and my collections promised to accumulate thus i was provided with sources both of industry and recreation the more completely to divert my thoughts from the recollection of my past misfortunes in this state so grateful to my feelings week after week glided away without interruption and alarm the situation in which i was now placed had some resemblance to that in which i had spent my earlier years with the advantage of a more attractive society and a riper judgment i began to look back upon the intervening period as upon a distempered and tormenting dream or rather perhaps my feelings were like those of a man recovered from an interval of raging delirium from ideas of horror confusion flight persecution agony and despair when i recollected what i had undergone it was not without satisfaction as the recollection of a thing that was past every day augmented my hope that it was never to return surely the dark and terrific menaces of mr falkland were rather the perturbed suggestions of his angry mind than the final result of a deliberate and digested system how happy should i feel beyond the ordinary lot of man if after the terrors i had undergone i should now find myself unexpectedly restored to the immunities of a human being while i was thus soothing my mind with fond imaginations it happened that a few bricklayers and their labourers came over from a distance of five or six miles to work upon some additions to one of the better sort of houses in the town which had changed its tenant no incident could be more trivial than this had it not been for a strange coincidence of time between this circumstance and a change which introduced itself into my situation this first manifested itself in a sort of shyness with which i was treated first by one person and then another of my newformed acquaintance they were backward to enter into conversation with me and answered my enquiries with an awkward and embarrassed air when they met me in the street or the field their countenances contracted a cloud and they endeavoured to shun me my scholars quitted me one after another and i had no longer any employment in my mechanical profession it is impossible to describe the sensations which the gradual but uninterrupted progress of this revolution produced in my mind it seemed as if i had some contagious disease from which every man shrunk with alarm and left me to perish unassisted and alone i asked one man and another to explain to me the meaning of these appearances but every one avoided the task and answered in an evasive and ambiguous manner i sometimes supposed that it was all a delusion of the imagination till the repetition of the sensation brought the reality too painfully home to my apprehension there are few things that give a greater shock to the mind than a phenomenon in the conduct of our fellow men of great importance to our concerns and for which we are unable to assign any plausible reason at times i was half inclined to believe that the change was not in other men but that some alienation of my own understanding generated the horrid vision i endeavoured to awaken from my dream and return to my former state of enjoyment and happiness but in vain to the same consideration it may be ascribed that unacquainted with the source of the evil observing its perpetual increase and finding it so far as i could perceive entirely arbitrary in its nature i was unable to ascertain its limits or the degree in which it would finally overwhelm me in the midst however of the wonderful and seemingly inexplicable nature of this scene there was one idea that instantly obtruded itself and that i could never after banish from my mind it is falkland in vain i struggled against the seeming improbability of the supposition in vain i said mr falkland wise as he is and pregnant in resources acts by human not by supernatural means he may overtake me by surprise and in a manner of which i had no previous expectation but he cannot produce a great and notorious effect without some visible agency however difficult it may be to trace that agency to its absolute author he cannot like those invisible personages who are supposed from time to time to interfere in human affairs ride in the whirlwind shroud himself in clouds and impenetrable darkness and scatter destruction upon the earth from his secret habitation thus it was that i bribed my imagination and endeavoured to persuade myself that my present unhappiness originated in a different source from my former all evils appeared trivial to me in comparison with the recollection and perpetuation of my parent misfortune i felt like a man distracted by the incoherence of my ideas to my present situation excluding from it the machinations of mr falkland on the one hand and on the other by the horror i conceived at the bare possibility of again encountering his animosity after a suspension of many weeks a suspension as i had hoped for ever an interval like this was an age to a person in the calamitous situation i had so long experienced but in spite of my efforts i could not banish from my mind the dreadful idea my original conceptions of the genius and perseverance of mr falkland had been such that i could with difficulty think any thing impossible to him i knew not how to set up my own opinions of material causes and the powers of the human mind as the limits of existence mr falkland had always been to my imagination an object of wonder and that which excites our wonder we scarcely suppose ourselves competent to analyse it may well be conceived that one of the first persons to whom i thought of applying for an explanation of this dreadful mystery was the accomplished laura my disappointment here cut me to the heart i was not prepared for it i recollected the ingenuousness of her nature the frankness of her manners the partiality with which she had honoured me if i were mortified with the coldness the ruggedness and the cruel mistake of principles with which the village inhabitants repelled my enquiries the mortification i suffered only drove me more impetuously to seek the cure of my griefs from this object of my admiration in laura said i i am secure from these vulgar prejudices i confide in her justice i am sure she will not cast me off unheard nor without strictly examining a question on all sides in which every thing that is valuable to a person she once esteemed may be involved thus encouraging myself i turned my steps to the place of her residence as i passed along i called up all my recollection i summoned my faculties i may be made miserable said i but it shall not be for want of any exertion of mine that promises to lead to happiness i will be clear collected simple in narrative ingenuous in communication i will leave nothing unsaid that the case may require i will not volunteer any thing that relates to my former transactions with mr falkland but if i find that my present calamity is connected with those transactions i will not fear but that by an honest explanation i shall remove it i knocked at the door a servant appeared and told me that her mistress hoped i would excuse her she must really beg to dispense with my visit i was thunderstruck i was rooted to the spot i had been carefully preparing my mind for every thing that i supposed likely to happen but this event had not entered into my calculations i roused myself in a partial degree and walked away without uttering a word i had not gone far before i perceived one of the workmen following me who put into my hands a billet the contents were theseâ€” mr williams let me see you no more i have a right at least to expect your compliance with this requisition and upon that condition i pardon the enormous impropriety and guilt with which you have conducted yourself to me and my family laura denison the sensations with which i read these few lines are indescribable i found in them a dreadful confirmation of the calamity that on all sides invaded me but what i felt most was the unmoved coldness with which they appeared to be written this coldness from laura my comforter my friend my mother to dismiss to cast me off for ever without one thought of compunction i determined however in spite of her requisition and in spite of her coldness to have an explanation with her i did not despair of conquering the antipathy she harboured i did not fear that i should rouse her from the vulgar and unworthy conception of condemning a man in points the most material to his happiness without stating the accusations that are urged against him and without hearing him in reply though i had no doubt by means of resolution of gaining access to her in her house yet i preferred taking her unprepared and not warmed against me by any previous contention accordingly the next morning at the time she usually devoted to half an hours air and exercise i hastened to her garden leaped the paling and concealed myself in an arbour presently i saw from my retreat the younger part of the family strolling through the garden and from thence into the fields but it was not my business to be seen by them i looked after them however with earnestness unobserved and i could not help asking myself with a deep and heartfelt sigh whether it were possible that i saw them now for the last time they had not advanced far into the fields before their mother made her appearance i observed in her her usual serenity and sweetness of countenance i could feel my heart knocking against my ribs my whole frame was in a tumult i stole out of the arbour and as i advanced nearer my pace became quickened for gods sake madam exclaimed i give me a hearing do not avoid me she stood still no sir she replied i shall not avoid you i wished you to dispense with this meeting but since i cannot obtain thatâ€”i am conscious of no wrong and therefore though the meeting gives me pain it inspires me with no fear oh madam answered i my friend the object of all my reverence whom i once ventured to call my mother can you wish not to hear me can you have no anxiety for my justification whatever may be the unfavourable impression you may have received against me not an atom i have neither wish nor inclination to hear you that tale which in its plain and unadorned state is destructive of the character of him to whom it relates no colouring can make an honest one good god can you think of condemning a man when you have heard only one side of his story indeed i can replied she with dignity the maxim of hearing both sides may be very well in some cases but it would be ridiculous to suppose that there are not cases that at the first mention are too clear to admit the shadow of a doubt by a wellconcerted defence you may give me new reasons to admire your abilities but i am acquainted with them already i can admire your abilities without tolerating your character madam amiable exemplary laura whom in the midst of all your harshness and inflexibility i honour i conjure you by every thing that is sacred to tell me what it is that has filled you with this sudden aversion to me no sir that you shall never obtain from me i have nothing to say to you i stand still and hear you because virtue disdains to appear abashed and confounded in the presence of vice your conduct even at this moment in my opinion condemns you true virtue refuses the drudgery of explanation and apology true virtue shines by its own light and needs no art to set it off you have the first principles of morality as yet to learn and can you imagine that the most upright conduct is always superior to the danger of ambiguity exactly so virtue sir consists in actions and not in words the good man and the bad are characters precisely opposite not characters distinguished from each other by imperceptible shades the providence that rules us all has not permitted us to be left without a clew in the most important of all questions eloquence may seek to confound it but it shall be my care to avoid its deceptive influence i do not wish to have my understanding perverted and all the differences of things concealed from my apprehension madam madam it would be impossible for you to hold this language if you had not always lived in this obscure retreat if you had ever been conversant with the passions and institutions of men it may be so and if that be the case i have great reason to be thankful to my god who has thus enabled me to preserve the innocence of my heart and the integrity of my understanding can you believe then that ignorance is the only or the safest preservative of integrity sir i told you at first and i repeat to you again that all your declamation is in vain i wish you would have saved me and yourself that pain which is the only thing that can possibly result from it but let us suppose that virtue could ever be the equivocal thing you would have me believe is it possible if you had been honest that you would not have acquainted me with your story is it possible that you would have left me to have been informed of it by a mere accident and with all the shocking aggravations you well knew that accident would give it is it possible you should have violated the most sacred of all trusts and have led me unknowingly to admit to the intercourse of my children a character which if as you pretend it is substantially honest you cannot deny to be blasted and branded in the face of the whole world go sir i despise you you are a monster and not a man i cannot tell whether my personal situation misleads me but to my thinking this last action of yours is worse than all the rest nature has constituted me the protector of my children i shall always remember and resent the indelible injury you have done them you have wounded me to the very heart and have taught me to what a pitch the villainy of man can extend madam i can be silent no longer i see that you have by some means come to a hearing of the story of mr falkland i have i am astonished you have the effrontery to pronounce his name that name has been a denomination as far back as my memory can reach for the most exalted of mortals the wisest and most generous of men madam i owe it to myself to set you right on this subject mr falklandâ€” mr williams i see my children returning from the fields and coming this way the basest action you ever did was the obtruding yourself upon them as an instructor i insist that you see them no more i command you to be silent i command you to withdraw if you persist in your absurd resolution of expostulating with me you must take some other time i could continue no longer i was in a manner heartbroken through the whole of this dialogue i could not think of protracting the pain of this admirable woman upon whom though i was innocent of the crimes she imputed to me i had inflicted so much pain already i yielded to the imperiousness of her commands and withdrew i hastened without knowing why from the presence of laura to my own habitation upon entering the house an apartment of which i occupied i found it totally deserted of its usual inhabitants the woman and her children were gone to enjoy the freshness of the breeze the husband was engaged in his usual outdoor occupations the doors of persons of the lower order in this part of the country are secured in the daytime only with a latch i entered and went into the kitchen of the family here as i looked round my eyes accidentally glanced upon a paper lying in one corner which by some association i was unable to explain roused in me a strong sensation of suspicion and curiosity i eagerly went towards it caught it up and found it to be the very paper of the wonderful and surprising history of caleb williams the discovery of which towards the close of my residence in london had produced in me such inexpressible anguish this encounter at once cleared up all the mystery that hung upon my late transactions abhorred and intolerable certainty succeeded to the doubts which had haunted my mind it struck me with the rapidity of lightning i felt a sudden torpor and sickness that pervaded every fibre of my frame was there no hope that remained for me was acquittal useless was there no period past or in prospect that could give relief to my sufferings was the odious and atrocious falsehood that had been invented against me to follow me wherever i went to strip me of character to deprive me of the sympathy and goodwill of mankind to wrest from me the very bread by which life must be sustained for the space perhaps of half an hour the agony i felt from this termination to my tranquillity and the expectation it excited of the enmity which would follow me through every retreat was such as to bereave me of all consistent thinking much more of the power of coming to any resolution as soon as this giddiness and horror of the mind subsided and the deadly calm that invaded my faculties was no more one stiff and master gale gained the ascendancy and drove me to an instant desertion of this late cherished retreat i had no patience to enter into further remonstrance and explanation with the inhabitants of my present residence i believed that it was in vain to hope to recover the favourable prepossession and tranquillity i had lately enjoyed in encountering the prejudices that were thus armed against me i should have to deal with a variety of dispositions and though i might succeed with some i could not expect to succeed with all i had seen too much of the reign of triumphant falsehood to have that sanguine confidence in the effects of my innocence which would have suggested itself to the mind of any other person of my propensities and my age the recent instance which had occurred in my conversation with laura might well contribute to discourage me i could not endure the thought of opposing the venom that was thus scattered against me in detail and through its minuter particles if ever it should be necessary to encounter it if i were pursued like a wild beast till i could no longer avoid turning upon my hunters i would then turn upon the true author of this unprincipled attack i would encounter the calumny in its strong hold i would rouse myself to an exertion hitherto unessayed and by the firmness intrepidity and unalterable constancy i should display would yet compel mankind to believe mr falkland a suborner and a murderer  chapter xiv i hasten to the conclusion of my melancholy story i began to write soon after the period to which i have now conducted it this was another resource that my mind ever eager in inventing means to escape from my misery suggested in my haste to withdraw myself from the retreat in wales where first the certainty of mr falklands menaces was confirmed to me i left behind me the apparatus of my etymological enquiries and the papers i had written upon the subject i have never been able to persuade myself to resume this pursuit it is always discouraging to begin over again a laborious task and exert ones self to recover a position we had already occupied i knew not how soon or how abruptly i might be driven from any new situation the appendages of the study in which i had engaged were too cumbrous for this state of dependence and uncertainty they only served to give new sharpness to the enmity of my foe and new poignancy to my hourlyrenewing distress but what was of greatest importance and made the deepest impression upon my mind was my separation from the family of laura fool that i was to imagine that there was any room for me in the abodes of friendship and tranquillity it was now first that i felt with the most intolerable acuteness how completely i was cut off from the whole human species other connections i had gained comparatively without interest and i saw them dissolved without the consummation of agony i had never experienced the purest refinements of friendship but in two instances that of collins and this of the family of laura solitude separation banishment these are words often in the mouths of human beings but few men except myself have felt the full latitude of their meaning the pride of philosophy has taught us to treat man as an individual he is no such thing he holds necessarily indispensably to his species he is like those twinbirths that have two heads indeed and four hands but if you attempt to detach them from each other they are inevitably subjected to miserable and lingering destruction it was this circumstance more than all the rest that gradually gorged my heart with abhorrence of mr falkland i could not think of his name but with a sickness and a loathing that seemed more than human it was by his means that i suffered the loss of one consolation after another of every thing that was happiness or that had the resemblance of happiness the writing of these memoirs served me as a source of avocation for several years for some time i had a melancholy satisfaction in it i was better pleased to retrace the particulars of calamities that had formerly afflicted me than to look forward as at other times i was too apt to do to those by which i might hereafter be overtaken i conceived that my story faithfully digested would carry in it an impression of truth that few men would be able to resist or at worst that by leaving it behind me when i should no longer continue to exist posterity might be induced to do me justice and seeing in my example what sort of evils are entailed upon mankind by society as it is at present constituted might be inclined to turn their attention upon the fountain from which such bitter waters have been accustomed to flow but these motives have diminished in their influence i have contracted a disgust for life and all its appendages writing which was at first a pleasure is changed into a burthen i shall compress into a small compass what remains to be told i discovered not long after the period of which i am speaking the precise cause of the reverse i had experienced in my residence in wales and included in that cause what it was i had to look for in my future adventures mr falkland had taken the infernal gines into his pay a man critically qualified for the service in which he was now engaged by the unfeeling brutality of his temper by his habits of mind at once audacious and artful and by the peculiar animosity and vengeance he had conceived against me the employment to which this man was hired was that of following me from place to place blasting my reputation and preventing me from the chance by continuing long in one residence of acquiring a character for integrity that should give new weight to any accusation i might at a future time be induced to prefer he had come to the seat of my residence with the bricklayers and labourers i have mentioned and while he took care to keep out of sight so far as related to me was industrious in disseminating that which in the eye of the world seemed to amount to a demonstration of the profligacy and detestableness of my character it was no doubt from him that the detested scroll had been procured which i had found in my habitation immediately prior to my quitting it in all this mr falkland reasoning upon his principles was only employing a necessary precaution there was something in the temper of his mind that impressed him with aversion to the idea of violently putting an end to my existence at the same time that unfortunately he could never deem himself sufficiently secured against my recrimination so long as i remained alive as to the fact of gines being retained by him for this tremendous purpose he by no means desired that it should become generally known but neither did he look upon the possibility of its being known with terror it was already too notorious for his wishes that i had advanced the most odious charges against him if he regarded me with abhorrence as the adversary of his fame those persons who had had occasion to be in any degree acquainted with our history did not entertain less abhorrence against me for my own sake if they should at any time know the pains he exerted in causing my evil reputation to follow me they would consider it as an act of impartial justice perhaps as a generous anxiety to prevent other men from being imposed upon and injured as he had been what expedient was i to employ for the purpose of counteracting the meditated and barbarous prudence which was thus destined in all changes of scene to deprive me of the benefits and consolations of human society there was one expedient against which i was absolutely determinedâ€”disguise i had experienced so many mortifications and such intolerable restraint when i formerly had recourse to it it was associated in my memory with sensations of such acute anguish that my mind was thus far entirely convinced life was not worth purchasing at so high a price but though in this respect i was wholly resolved there was another point that did not appear so material and in which therefore i was willing to accommodate myself to circumstances i was contented if that would insure my peace to submit to the otherwise unmanly expedient of passing by a different name but the change of my name the abruptness with which i removed from place to place the remoteness and the obscurity which i proposed to myself in the choice of my abode were all insufficient to elude the sagacity of gines or the unrelenting constancy with which mr falkland incited my tormentor to pursue me whithersoever i removed myself it was not long before i had occasion to perceive this detested adversary in my rear no words can enable me to do justice to the sensations which this circumstance produced in me it was like what has been described of the eye of omniscience pursuing the guilty sinner and darting a ray that awakens him to new sensibility at the very moment that otherwise exhausted nature would lull him into a temporary oblivion of the reproaches of his conscience sleep fled from my eyes no walls could hide me from the discernment of this hated foe every where his industry was unwearied to create for me new distress rest i had none relief i had none never could i count upon an instants security never could i wrap myself in the shroud of oblivion the minutes in which i did not actually perceive him were contaminated and blasted with the certain expectation of his speedy interference in my first retreat i had passed a few weeks of delusive tranquillity but never after was i happy enough to attain to so much as that shadowy gratification i spent some years in this dreadful vicissitude of pain my sensations at certain periods amounted to insanity i pursued in every succeeding instance the conduct i had adopted at first i determined never to enter into a contest of accusation and defence with the execrable gines if i could have submitted to it in other respects what purpose would it answer i should have but an imperfect and mutilated story to tell this story had succeeded with persons already prepossessed in my favour by personal intercourse but could it succeed with strangers it had succeeded so long as i was able to hide myself from my pursuers but could it succeed now that this appeared impracticable and that they proceeded by arming against me a whole vicinity at once it is inconceivable the mischiefs that this kind of existence included why should i insist upon such aggravations as hunger beggary and external wretchedness these were an inevitable consequence it was by the desertion of mankind that in each successive instance i was made acquainted with my fate delay in such a moment served but to increase the evil and when i fled meagreness and penury were the ordinary attendants of my course but this was a small consideration indignation at one time and unconquerable perseverance at another sustained me where humanity left to itself would probably have sunk it has already appeared that i was not of a temper to endure calamity without endeavouring by every means i could devise to elude and disarm it recollecting as i was habituated to do the various projects by which my situation could be meliorated the question occurred to me why should i be harassed by the pursuits of this gines why man to man may i not by the powers of my mind attain the ascendancy over him at present he appears to be the persecutor and i the persecuted is not this difference the mere creature of the imagination may i not employ my ingenuity to vex him with difficulties and laugh at the endless labour to which he will be condemned alas this is a speculation for a mind at ease it is not the persecution but the catastrophe which is annexed to it that makes the difference between the tyrant and the sufferer in mere corporal exertion the hunter perhaps is upon a level with the miserable animal he pursues but could it be forgotten by either of us that at every stage gines was to gratify his malignant passions by disseminating charges of the most infamous nature and exciting against me the abhorrence of every honest bosom while i was to sustain the stillrepeated annihilation of my peace my character and my bread could i by any refinement of reason convert this dreadful series into sport i had no philosophy that qualified me for so extraordinary an effort if under other circumstances i could even have entertained so strange an imagination i was restrained in the present instance by the necessity of providing for myself the means of subsistence and the fetters which through that necessity the forms of human society imposed upon my exertions in one of those changes of residence to which my miserable fate repeatedly compelled me i met upon a road which i was obliged to traverse the friend of my youth my earliest and best beloved friend the venerable collins it was one of those misfortunes which served to accumulate my distress that this man had quitted the island of great britain only a very few weeks before that fatal reverse of fortune which had ever since pursued me with unrelenting eagerness mr falkland in addition to the large estate he possessed in england had a very valuable plantation in the west indies this property had been greatly mismanaged by the person who had the direction of it on the spot and after various promises and evasions on his part which however they might serve to beguile the patience of mr falkland had been attended with no salutary fruits it was resolved that mr collins should go over in person to rectify the abuses which had so long prevailed there had even been some idea of his residing several years if not settling finally upon the plantation from that hour to the present i had never received the smallest intelligence respecting him i had always considered the circumstance of his critical absence as one of my severest misfortunes mr collins had been one of the first persons even in the period of my infancy to conceive hopes of me as of something above the common standard and had contributed more than any other to encourage and assist my juvenile studies he had been the executor of the little property of my father who had fixed upon him for that purpose in consideration of the mutual affection that existed between us and i seemed on every account to have more claim upon his protection than upon that of any other human being i had always believed that had he been present in the crisis of my fortune he would have felt a conviction of my innocence and convinced himself would by means of the venerableness and energy of his character have interposed so effectually as to have saved me the greater part of my subsequent misfortunes there was yet another idea in my mind relative to this subject which had more weight with me than even the substantial exertions of friendship i should have expected from him the greatest aggravation of my present lot was that i was cut off from the friendship of mankind i can safely affirm that poverty and hunger that endless wanderings that a blasted character and the curses that clung to my name were all of them slight misfortunes compared to this i endeavoured to sustain myself by the sense of my integrity but the voice of no man upon earth echoed to the voice of my conscience i called aloud but there was none to answer there was none that regarded to me the whole world was unhearing as the tempest and as cold as the torpedo sympathy the magnetic virtue the hidden essence of our life was extinct nor was this the sum of my misery this food so essential to an intelligent existence seemed perpetually renewing before me in its fairest colours only the more effectually to elude my grasp and to mock my hunger from time to time i was prompted to unfold the affections of my soul only to be repelled with the greater anguish and to be baffled in a way the most intolerably mortifying no sight therefore could give me a purer delight than that which now presented itself to my eyes it was some time however before either of us recognised the person of the other ten years had elapsed since our last interview mr collins looked much older than he had done at that period in addition to which he was in his present appearance pale sickly and thin these unfavourable effects had been produced by the change of climate particularly trying to persons in an advanced period of life add to which i supposed him to be at that moment in the west indies i was probably as much altered in the period that had elapsed as he had been i was the first to recollect him he was on horseback i on foot i had suffered him to pass me in a moment the full idea of who he was rushed upon my mind i ran i called with an impetuous voice i was unable to restrain the vehemence of my emotions the ardour of my feelings disguised my usual tone of speaking which otherwise mr collins would infallibly have recognised his sight was already dim he pulled up his horse till i should overtake him and then said who are you i do not know you my father exclaimed i embracing one of his knees with fervour and delight i am your son once your little caleb whom you a thousand times loaded with your kindness the unexpected repetition of my name gave a kind of shuddering emotion to my friend which was however checked by his age and the calm and benevolent philosophy that formed one of his most conspicuous habits i did not expect to see you replied he i did not wish it my best my oldest friend answered i respect blending itself with my impatience do not say so i have not a friend any where in the whole world but you in you at least let me find sympathy and reciprocal affection if you knew how anxiously i have thought of you during the whole period of your absence you would not thus grievously disappoint me in your return how is it said mr collins gravely that you have been reduced to this forlorn condition was it not the inevitable consequence of your own actions the actions of others not mine does not your heart tell you that i am innocent no my observation of your early character taught me that you would be extraordinary but unhappily all extraordinary men are not good men that seems to be a lottery dependent on circumstances apparently the most trivial will you hear my justification i am as sure as i am of my existence that i can convince you of my purity certainly if you require it i will hear you but that must not be just now i could have been glad to decline it wholly at my age i am not fit for the storm and i am not so sanguine as you in my expectation of the result of what would you convince me that mr falkland is a suborner and murderer i made no answer my silence was an affirmative to the question and what benefit will result from this conviction i have known you a promising boy whose character might turn to one side or the other as events should decide i have known mr falkland in his maturer years and have always admired him as the living model of liberality and goodness if you could change all my ideas and show me that there was no criterion by which vice might be prevented from being mistaken for virtue what benefit would arise from that i must part with all my interior consolation and all my external connections and for what what is it you propose the death of mr falkland by the hands of the hangman no i will not hurt a hair of his head unless compelled to it by a principle of defence but surely you owe me justice what justice the justice of proclaiming your innocence you know what consequences are annexed to that but i do not believe i shall find you innocent if you even succeed in perplexing my understanding you will not succeed in enlightening it such is the state of mankind that innocence when involved in circumstances of suspicion can scarcely ever make out a demonstration of its purity and guilt can often make us feel an insurmountable reluctance to the pronouncing it guilt meanwhile for the purchase of this uncertainty i must sacrifice all the remaining comforts of my life i believe mr falkland to be virtuous but i know him to be prejudiced he would never forgive me even this accidental parley if by any means he should come to be acquainted with it oh argue not the consequences that are possible to result answered i impatiently i have a right to your kindness i have a right to your assistance you have them you have them to a certain degree and it is not likely that by any process of examination you can have them entire you know my habits of thinking i regard you as vicious but i do not consider the vicious as proper objects of indignation and scorn i consider you as a machine you are not constituted i am afraid to be greatly useful to your fellow men but you did not make yourself you are just what circumstances irresistibly compelled you to be i am sorry for your ill properties but i entertain no enmity against you nothing but benevolence considering you in the light in which i at present consider you i am ready to contribute every thing in my power to your real advantage and would gladly assist you if i knew how in detecting and extirpating the errors that have misled you you have disappointed me but i have no reproaches to utter it is more necessary for me to feel compassion for you than that i should accumulate your misfortune by my censures what could i say to such a man as this amiable incomparable man never was my mind more painfully divided than at that moment the more he excited my admiration the more imperiously did my heart command me whatever were the price it should cost to extort his friendship i was persuaded that severe duty required of him that he should reject all personal considerations that he should proceed resolutely to the investigation of the truth and that if he found the result terminating in my favour he should resign all his advantages and deserted as i was by the world make a common cause and endeavour to compensate the general injustice but was it for me to force this conduct upon him if now in his declining years his own fortitude shrank from it alas neither he nor i foresaw the dreadful catastrophe that was so closely impending otherwise i am well assured that no tenderness for his remaining tranquillity would have withheld him from a compliance with my wishes on the other hand could i pretend to know what evils might result to him from his declaring himself my advocate might not his integrity be browbeaten and defeated as mine had been did the imbecility of his grey hairs afford no advantage to my terrible adversary in the contest might not mr falkland reduce him to a condition as wretched and low as mine after all was it not vice in me to desire to involve another man in my sufferings if i regarded them as intolerable this was still an additional reason why i should bear them alone influenced by these considerations i assented to his views i assented to be thought hardly of by the man in the world whose esteem i most ardently desired rather than involve him in possible calamity i assented to the resigning what appeared to me at that moment as the last practicable comfort of my life a comfort upon the thought of which while i surrendered it my mind dwelt with undescribable longings mr collins was deeply affected with the apparent ingenuousness with which i expressed my feelings the secret struggle of his mind was can this be hypocrisy the individual with whom i am conferring if virtuous is one of the most disinterestedly virtuous persons in the world we tore ourselves from each other mr collins promised as far as he was able to have an eye upon my vicissitudes and to assist me in every respect that was consistent with a just recollection of consequences thus i parted as it were with the last expiring hope of my mind and voluntarily consented thus maimed and forlorn to encounter all the evils that were yet in store for me this is the latest event which at present i think it necessary to record i shall doubtless hereafter have further occasion to take up the pen great and unprecedented as my sufferings have been i feel intimately persuaded that there are worse sufferings that await me what mysterious cause is it that enables me to write this and not to perish under the horrible apprehension  chapter xv it is as i foreboded the presage with which i was visited was prophetic i am now to record a new and terrible revolution of my fortune and my mind having made experiment of various situations with one uniform result i at length determined to remove myself if possible from the reach of my persecutor by going into voluntary banishment from my native soil this was my last resource for tranquillity for honest fame for those privileges to which human life is indebted for the whole of its value in some distant climate said i surely i may find that security which is necessary to persevering pursuit surely i may lift my head erect associate with men upon the footing of a man acquire connections and preserve them it is inconceivable with what ardent teachings of the soul i aspired to this termination this last consolation was denied me by the inexorable falkland at the time the project was formed i was at no great distance from the east coast of the island and i resolved to take ship at harwich and pass immediately into holland i accordingly repaired to that place and went almost as soon as i arrived to the port but there was no vessel perfectly ready to sail i left the port and withdrew to an inn where after some time i retired to a chamber i was scarcely there before the door of the room was opened and the man whose countenance was the most hateful to my eyes gines entered the apartment he shut the door as soon as he entered youngster said he i have a little private intelligence to communicate to you i come as a friend and that i may save you a labourinvain trouble if you consider what i have to say in that light it will be the better for you it is my business now do you see for want of a better to see that you do not break out of bounds not that i much matter having one man for my employer or dancing attendance after anothers heels but i have special kindness for you for some good turns that you wot of and therefore i do not stand upon ceremonies you have led me a very pretty round already and out of the love i bear you you shall lead me as much further if you will but beware the salt seas they are out of my orders you are a prisoner at present and i believe all your life will remain so thanks to the milkandwater softness of your former master if i had the ordering of these things it should go with you in another fashion as long as you think proper you are a prisoner within the rules and the rules with which the softhearted squire indulges you are all england scotland and wales but you are not to go out of these climates the squire is determined you shall never pass the reach of his disposal he has therefore given orders that whenever you attempt so to do you shall be converted from a prisoner at large to a prisoner in good earnest a friend of mine followed you just now to the harbour i was within call and if there had been any appearance of your setting your foot from land we should have been with you in a trice and laid you fast by the heels i would advise you for the future to keep at a proper distance from the sea for fear of the worst you see i tell you all this for your good for my part i should be better satisfied if you were in limbo with a rope about your neck and a comfortable birds eye prospect to the gallows but i do as i am directed and so good night to you the intelligence thus conveyed to me occasioned an instantaneous revolution in both my intellectual and animal system i disdained to answer or take the smallest notice of the fiend by whom it was delivered it is now three days since i received it and from that moment to the present my blood has been in a perpetual ferment my thoughts wander from one idea of horror to another with incredible rapidity i have had no sleep i have scarcely remained in one posture for a minute together it has been with the utmost difficulty that i have been able to command myself far enough to add a few pages to my story but uncertain as i am of the events of each succeeding hour i determined to force myself to the performance of this task all is not right within me how it will terminate god knows i sometimes fear that i shall be wholly deserted of my reason whatâ€”dark mysterious unfeeling unrelenting tyrantis it come to this when nero and caligula swayed the roman sceptre it was a fearful thing to offend these bloody rulers the empire had already spread itself from climate to climate and from sea to sea if their unhappy victim fled to the rising of the sun where the luminary of day seems to us first to ascend from the waves of the ocean the power of the tyrant was still behind him if he withdrew to the west to hesperian darkness and the shores of barbarian thule still he was not safe from his goredrenched foeâ€”falkland art thou the offspring in whom the lineaments of these tyrants are faithfully preserved was the world with all its climates made in vain for thy helpless unoffending victim tremble tyrants have trembled surrounded with whole armies of their janissaries what should make thee inaccessible to my fury no i will use no daggers i will unfold a talei will show thee to the world for what thou art and all the men that live shall confess my truthdidst thou imagine that i was altogether passive a mere worm organised to feel sensations of pain but no emotion of resentment didst thou imagine that there was no danger in inflicting on me pains however great miseries however dreadful didst thou believe me impotent imbecile and idiotlike with no understanding to contrive thy ruin and no energy to perpetrate it i will tell a taleâ€” the justice of the country shall hear me the elements of nature in universal uproar shall not interrupt me i will speak with a voice more fearful than thunderwhy should i be supposed to speak from any dishonourable motive i am under no prosecution now i shall not now appear to be endeavouring to remove a criminal indictment from myself by throwing it back on its authorshall i regret the ruin that will overwhelm thee too long have i been tenderhearted and forbearing what benefit has ever resulted from my mistaken clemency there is no evil thou hast scrupled to accumulate upon me neither will i be more scrupulous thou hast shown no mercy and thou shalt receive nonei must be calm bold as a lion yet collected this is a moment pregnant with fate i knowâ€”i think i knowâ€”that i will be triumphant and crush my seemingly omnipotent foe but should it be otherwise at least he shall not be every way successful his fame shall not be immortal as he thinks these papers shall preserve the truth they shall one day be published and then the world shall do justice on us both recollecting that i shall not die wholly without consolation it is not to be endured that falsehood and tyranny should reign for ever how impotent are the precautions of man against the eternally existing laws of the intellectual world this falkland has invented against me every species of foul accusation he has hunted me from city to city he has drawn his lines of circumvallation round me that i may not escape he has kept his scenters of human prey for ever at my heels he may hunt me out of the worldâ€”in vain with this engine this little pen i defeat all his machinations i stab him in the very point he was most solicitous to defend collins i now address myself to you i have consented that you should yield me no assistance in my present terrible situation i am content to die rather than do any thing injurious to your tranquillity but remember you are my father still i conjure you by all the love you ever bore me by the benefits you have conferred on me by the forbearance and kindness towards you that now penetrates my soul by my innocenceâ€”for if these be the last words i shall ever write i die protesting my innocenceby all these or whatever tie more sacred has influence on your soul i conjure you listen to my last request preserve these papers from destruction and preserve them from falkland it is all i ask i have taken care to provide a safe mode of conveying them into your possession and i have a firm confidence which i will not suffer to depart from me that they will one day find their way to the public the pen lingers in my trembling fingers is there any thing i have left unsaidâ€”the contents of the fatal trunk from which all my misfortunes originated i have never been able to ascertain i once thought it contained some murderous instrument or relic connected with the fate of the unhappy tyrrel i am now persuaded that the secret it encloses is a faithful narrative of that and its concomitant transactions written by mr falkland and reserved in case of the worst that if by any unforeseen event his guilt should come to be fully disclosed it might contribute to redeem the wreck of his reputation but the truth or the falsehood of this conjecture is of little moment if falkland shall never be detected to the satisfaction of the world such a narrative will probably never see the light in that case this story of mine may amply severely perhaps supply its place i know not what it is that renders me thus solemn i have a secret foreboding as if i should never again be master of myself if i succeed in what i now meditate respecting falkland my precaution in the disposal of these papers will have been unnecessary i shall no longer be reduced to artifice and evasion if i fail the precaution will appear to have been wisely chosen  postscript all is over i have carried into execution my meditated attempt my situation is totally changed i now sit down to give an account of it for several weeks after the completion of this dreadful business my mind was in too tumultuous a state to permit me to write i think i shall now be able to arrange my thoughts sufficiently for that purpose great god how wondrous how terrible are the events that have intervened since i was last employed in a similar manner it is no wonder that my thoughts were solemn and my mind filled with horrible forebodings having formed my resolution i set out from harwich for the metropolitan town of the county in which mr falkland resided gines i well knew was in my rear that was of no consequence to me he might wonder at the direction i pursued but he could not tell with what purpose i pursued it my design was a secret carefully locked up in my own breast it was not without a sentiment of terror that i entered a town which had been the scene of my long imprisonment i proceeded to the house of the chief magistrate the instant i arrived that i might give no time to my adversary to counterwork my proceeding i told him who i was and that i was come from a distant part of the kingdom for the purpose of rendering him the medium of a charge of murder against my former patron my name was already familiar to him he answered that he could not take cognizance of my deposition that i was an object of universal execration in that part of the world and he was determined upon no account to be the vehicle of my depravity i warned him to consider well what he was doing i called upon him for no favour i only applied to him in the regular exercise of his function would he take upon him to say that he had a right at his pleasure to suppress a charge of this complicated nature i had to accuse mr falkland of repeated murders the perpetrator knew that i was in possession of the truth upon the subject and knowing that i went perpetually in danger of my life from his malice and revenge i was resolved to go through with the business if justice were to be obtained from any court in england upon what pretence did he refuse my deposition i was in every respect a competent witness i was of age to understand the nature of an oath i was in my perfect senses i was untarnished by the verdict of any jury or the sentence of any judge his private opinion of my character could not alter the law of the land i demanded to be confronted with mr falkland and i was well assured i should substantiate the charge to the satisfaction of the whole world if he did not think proper to apprehend him upon my single testimony i should be satisfied if he only sent him notice of the charge and summoned him to appear the magistrate finding me thus resolute thought proper a little to lower his tone he no longer absolutely refused to comply with my requisition but condescended to expostulate with me he represented to me mr falklands health which had for some years been exceedingly indifferent his having been once already brought to the most solemn examination upon this charge the diabolical malice in which alone my proceeding must have originated and the tenfold ruin it would bring down upon my head to all these representations my answer was short i was determined to go on and would abide the consequences a summons was at length granted and notice sent to mr falkland of the charge preferred against him three days elapsed before any further step could be taken in this business this interval in no degree contributed to tranquillise my mind the thought of preferring a capital accusation against and hastening the death of such a man as mr falkland was by no means an opiate to reflection at one time i commended the action either as just revenge for the benevolence of my nature was in a great degree turned to gall or as necessary selfdefence or as that which in an impartial and philanthropical estimate included the smallest evil at another time i was haunted with doubts but in spite of these variations of sentiment i uniformly determined to persist i felt as if impelled by a tide of unconquerable impulse the consequences were such as might well appal the stoutest heart either the ignominious execution of a man whom i had once so deeply venerated and whom now i sometimes suspected not to be without his claims to veneration or a confirmation perhaps an increase of the calamities i had so long endured yet these i preferred to a state of uncertainty i desired to know the worst to put an end to the hope however faint which had been so long my torment and above all to exhaust and finish the catalogue of expedients that were at my disposition my mind was worked up to a state little short of frenzy my body was in a burning fever with the agitation of my thoughts when i laid my hand upon my bosom or my head it seemed to scorch them with the fervency of its heat i could not sit still for a moment i panted with incessant desire that the dreadful crisis i had so eagerly invoked were come and were over after an interval of three days i met mr falkland in the presence of the magistrate to whom i had applied upon the subject i had only two hours notice to prepare myself mr falkland seeming as eager as i to have the question brought to a crisis and laid at rest for ever i had an opportunity before the examination to learn that mr forester was drawn by some business on an excursion on the continent and that collins whose health when i saw him was in a very precarious state was at this time confined with an alarming illness his constitution had been wholly broken by his west indian expedition the audience i met at the house of the magistrate consisted of several gentlemen and others selected for the purpose the plan being in some respects as in the former instance to find a medium between the suspicious air of a private examination and the indelicacy as it was styled of an examination exposed to the remark of every casual spectator i can conceive of no shock greater than that i received from the sight of mr falkland his appearance on the last occasion on which we met had been haggard ghostlike and wild energy in his gestures and frenzy in his aspect it was now the appearance of a corpse he was brought in in a chair unable to stand fatigued and almost destroyed by the journey he had just taken his visage was colourless his limbs destitute of motion almost of life his head reclined upon his bosom except that now and then he lifted it up and opened his eyes with a languid glance immediately after which he sunk back into his former apparent insensibility he seemed not to have three hours to live he had kept his chamber for several weeks but the summons of the magistrate had been delivered to him at his bedside his orders respecting letters and written papers being so peremptory that no one dared to disobey them upon reading the paper he was seized with a very dangerous fit but as soon as he recovered he insisted upon being conveyed with all practicable expedition to the place of appointment falkland in the most helpless state was still falkland firm in command and capable to extort obedience from every one that approached him what a sight was this to me till the moment that falkland was presented to my view my breast was steeled to pity i thought that i had coolly entered into the reason of the case passion in a state of solemn and omnipotent vehemence always appears to be coolness to him in whom it domineers and that i had determined impartially and justly i believed that if mr falkland were permitted to persist in his schemes we must both of us be completely wretched i believed that it was in my power by the resolution i had formed to throw my share of this wretchedness from me and that his could scarcely be increased it appeared therefore to my mind to be a mere piece of equity and justice such as an impartial spectator would desire that one person should be miserable in preference to two that one person rather than two should be incapacitated from acting his part and contributing his share to the general welfare i thought that in this business i had risen superior to personal considerations and judged with a total neglect of the suggestions of selfregard it is true mr falkland was mortal but notwithstanding his apparent decay he might live long ought i to submit to waste the best years of my life in my present wretched situation he had declared that his reputation should be for ever inviolate this was his ruling passion the thought that worked his soul to madness he would probably therefore leave a legacy of persecution to be received by me from the hands of gines or some other villain equally atrocious when he should himself be no more now or never was the time for me to redeem my future life from endless woe but all these finespun reasonings vanished before the object that was now presented to me shall i trample upon a man thus dreadfully reduced shall i point my animosity against one whom the system of nature has brought down to the grave shall i poison with sounds the most intolerable to his ears the last moments of a man like falkland it is impossible there must have been some dreadful mistake in the train of argument that persuaded me to be the author of this hateful scene there must have been a better and more magnanimous remedy to the evils under which i groaned it was too late the mistake i had committed was now gone past all power of recall here was falkland solemnly brought before a magistrate to answer to a charge of murder here i stood having already declared myself the author of the charge gravely and sacredly pledged to support it this was my situation and thus situated i was called upon immediately to act my whole frame shook i would eagerly have consented that that moment should have been the last of my existence i however believed that the conduct now most indispensably incumbent on me was to lay the emotions of my soul naked before my hearers i looked first at mr falkland and then at the magistrate and attendants and then at mr falkland again my voice was suffocated with agony i beganâ€” why cannot i recall the last four days of my life how was it possible for me to be so eager so obstinate in a purpose so diabolical oh that i had listened to the expostulations of the magistrate that hears me or submitted to the wellmeant despotism of his authority hitherto i have been only miserable henceforth i shall account myself base hitherto though hardly treated by mankind i stood acquitted at the bar of my own conscience i had not filled up the measure of my wretchedness would to god it were possible for me to retire from this scene without uttering another word i would brave the consequencesâ€”i would submit to any imputation of cowardice falsehood and profligacy rather than add to the weight of misfortune with which mr falkland is overwhelmed but the situation and the demands of mr falkland himself forbid me he in compassion for whose fallen state i would willingly forget every interest of my own would compel me to accuse that he might enter upon his justification i will confess every sentiment of my heart no penitence no anguish can expiate the folly and the cruelty of this last act i have perpetrated but mr falkland well knowsâ€”i affirm it in his presenceâ€”how unwillingly i have proceeded to this extremity i have reverenced him he was worthy of reverence i have loved him he was endowed with qualities that partook of divine from the first moment i saw him i conceived the most ardent admiration he condescended to encourage me i attached myself to him with the fulness of my affection he was unhappy i exerted myself with youthful curiosity to discover the secret of his woe this was the beginning of misfortune what shall i sayâ€”he was indeed the murderer of tyrrel he suffered the hawkinses to be executed knowing that they were innocent and that he alone was guilty after successive surmises after various indiscretions on my part and indications on his he at length confided to me at full the fatal tale mr falkland i most solemnly conjure you to recollect yourself did i ever prove myself unworthy of your confidence the secret was a most painful burthen to me it was the extremest folly that led me unthinkingly to gain possession of it but i would have died a thousand deaths rather than betray it it was the jealousy of your own thoughts and the weight that hung upon your mind that led you to watch my motions and to conceive alarm from every particle of my conduct you began in confidence why did you not continue in confidence the evil that resulted from my original imprudence would then have been comparatively little you threatened me did i then betray you a word from my lips at that time would have freed me from your threats for ever i bore them for a considerable period and at last quitted your service and threw myself a fugitive upon the world in silence why did you not suffer me to depart you brought me back by stratagem and violence and wantonly accused me of an enormous felony did i then mention a syllable of the murder the secret of which was in my possession where is the man that has suffered more from the injustice of society than i have done i was accused of a villainy that my heart abhorred i was sent to jail i will not enumerate the horrors of my prison the lightest of which would make the heart of humanity shudder i looked forward to the gallows young ambitious fond of life innocent as the child unborn i looked forward to the gallows i believed that one word of resolute accusation against my patron would deliver me yet i was silent i armed myself with patience uncertain whether it were better to accuse or to die did this show me a man unworthy to be trusted i determined to break out of prison with infinite difficulty and repeated miscarriages i at length effected my purpose instantly a proclamation with a hundred guineas reward was issued for apprehending me i was obliged to take shelter among the refuse of mankind in the midst of a gang of thieves i encountered the most imminent peril of my life when i entered this retreat and when i quitted it immediately after i travelled almost the whole length of the kingdom in poverty and distress in hourly danger of being retaken and manacled like a felon i would have fled my country i was prevented i had recourse to various disguises i was innocent and yet was compelled to as many arts and subterfuges as could have been entailed on the worst of villains in london i was as much harassed and as repeatedly alarmed as i had been in my flight through the country did all these persecutions persuade me to put an end to my silence no i suffered them with patience and submission i did not make one attempt to retort them upon their author i fell at last into the hands of the miscreants that are nourished with human blood in this terrible situation i for the first time attempted by turning informer to throw the weight from myself happily for me the london magistrate listened to my tale with insolent contempt i soon and long repented of my rashness and rejoiced in my miscarriage i acknowledge that in various ways mr falkland showed humanity towards me during this period he would have prevented my going to prison at first he contributed towards my subsistence during my detention he had no share in the pursuit that had been set on foot against me he at length procured my discharge when brought forward for trial but a great part of his forbearance was unknown to me i supposed him to be my unrelenting pursuer i could not forget that whoever heaped calamities on me in the sequel they all originated in his forged accusation the prosecution against me for felony was now at an end why were not my sufferings permitted to terminate then and i allowed to hide my weary head in some obscure yet tranquil retreat had i not sufficiently proved my constancy and fidelity would not a compromise in this situation have been most wise and most secure but the restless and jealous anxiety of mr falkland would not permit him to repose the least atom of confidence the only compromise that he proposed was that with my own hand i should sign myself a villain i refused this proposal and have ever since been driven from place to place deprived of peace of honest fame even of bread for a long time i persisted in the resolution that no emergency should convert me into the assailant in an evil hour i at last listened to my resentment and impatience and the hateful mistake into which i fell has produced the present scene i now see that mistake in all its enormity i am sure that if i had opened my heart to mr falkland if i had told to him privately the tale that i have now been telling he could not have resisted my reasonable demand after all his precautions he must ultimately have depended upon my forbearance could he be sure that if i were at last worked up to disclose every thing i knew and to enforce it with all the energy i could exert i should obtain no credit if he must in every case be at my mercy in which mode ought he to have sought his safety in conciliation or in inexorable cruelty mr falkland is of a noble nature yes in spite of the catastrophe of tyrrel of the miserable end of the hawkinses and of all that i have myself suffered i affirm that he has qualities of the most admirable kind it is therefore impossible that he could have resisted a frank and fervent expostulation the frankness and the fervour in which the whole soul is poured out i despaired while it was yet time to have made the just experiment but my despair was criminal was treason against the sovereignty of truth i have told a plain and unadulterated tale i came hither to curse but i remain to bless i came to accuse but am compelled to applaud i proclaim to all the world that mr falkland is a man worthy of affection and kindness and that i am myself the basest and most odious of mankind never will i forgive myself the iniquity of this day the memory will always haunt me and embitter every hour of my existence in thus acting i have been a murdererâ€”a cool deliberate unfeeling murdererâ€”i have said what my accursed precipitation has obliged me to say do with me as you please i ask no favour death would be a kindness compared to what i feel such were the accents dictated by my remorse i poured them out with uncontrollable impetuosity for my heart was pierced and i was compelled to give vent to its anguish every one that heard me was petrified with astonishment every one that heard me was melted into tears they could not resist the ardour with which i praised the great qualities of falkland they manifested their sympathy in the tokens of my penitence how shall i describe the feelings of this unfortunate man before i began he seemed sunk and debilitated incapable of any strenuous impression when i mentioned the murder i could perceive in him an involuntary shuddering though it was counteracted partly by the feebleness of his frame and partly by the energy of his mind this was an allegation he expected and he had endeavoured to prepare himself for it but there was much of what i said of which he had had no previous conception when i expressed the anguish of my mind he seemed at first startled and alarmed lest this should be a new expedient to gain credit to my tale his indignation against me was great for having retained all my resentment towards him thus as it might be to the last hour of his existence it was increased when he discovered me as he supposed using a pretence of liberality and sentiment to give new edge to my hostility but as i went on he could no longer resist he saw my sincerity he was penetrated with my grief and compunction he rose from his seat supported by the attendants andâ€”to my infinite astonishmentâ€”threw himself into my arms williams said he you have conquered i see too late the greatness and elevation of your mind i confess that it is to my fault and not yours that it is to the excess of jealousy that was ever burning in my bosom that i owe my ruin i could have resisted any plan of malicious accusation you might have brought against me but i see that the artless and manly story you have told has carried conviction to every hearer all my prospects are concluded all that i most ardently desired is for ever frustrated i have spent a life of the basest cruelty to cover one act of momentary vice and to protect myself against the prejudices of my species i stand now completely detected my name will be consecrated to infamy while your heroism your patience and your virtues will be for ever admired you have inflicted on me the most fatal of all mischiefs but i bless the hand that wounds me and nowâ€”turning to the magistrateâ€”and now do with me as you please i am prepared to suffer all the vengeance of the law you cannot inflict on me more than i deserve you cannot hate me more than i hate myself i am the most execrable of all villains i have for many years i know not how long dragged on a miserable existence in insupportable pain i am at last in recompense for all my labours and my crimes dismissed from it with the disappointment of my only remaining hope the destruction of that for the sake of which alone i consented to exist it was worthy of such a life that it should continue just long enough to witness this final overthrow if however you wish to punish me you must be speedy in your justice for as reputation was the blood that warmed my heart so i feel that death and infamy must seize me together i record the praises bestowed on me by falkland not because i deserved them but because they serve to aggravate the baseness of my cruelty he survived this dreadful scene but three days i have been his murderer it was fit that he should praise my patience who has fallen a victim life and fame to my precipitation it would have been merciful in comparison if i had planted a dagger in his heart he would have thanked me for my kindness but atrocious execrable wretch that i have been i wantonly inflicted on him an anguish a thousand times worse than death meanwhile i endure the penalty of my crime his figure is ever in imagination before me waking or sleeping i still behold him he seems mildly to expostulate with me for my unfeeling behaviour i live the devoted victim of conscious reproach alas i am the same caleb williams that so short a time ago boasted that however great were the calamities i endured i was still innocent such has been the result of a project i formed for delivering myself from the evil that had so long attended me i thought that if falkland were dead i should return once again to all that makes life worth possessing i thought that if the guilt of falkland were established fortune and the world would smile upon my efforts both these events are accomplished and it is now only that i am truly miserable why should my reflections perpetually centre upon myselfâ€”self an overweening regard to which has been the source of my errors falkland i will think only of thee and from that thought will draw everfresh nourishment for my sorrows one generous one disinterested tear i will consecrate to thy ashes a nobler spirit lived not among the sons of men thy intellectual powers were truly sublime and thy bosom burned with a godlike ambition but of what use are talents and sentiments in the corrupt wilderness of human society it is a rank and rotten soil from which every finer shrub draws poison as it grows all that in a happier field and a purer air would expand into virtue and germinate into usefulness is thus concerted into henbane and deadly nightshade falkland thou enteredst upon thy career with the purest and most laudable intentions but thou imbibedst the poison of chivalry with thy earliest youth and the base and lowminded envy that met thee on thy return to thy native seats operated with this poison to hurry thee into madness soon too soon by this fatal coincidence were the blooming hopes of thy youth blasted for ever from that moment thou only continuedst to live to the phantom of departed honour from that moment thy benevolence was in a great part turned into rankling jealousy and inexorable precaution year after year didst thou spend in this miserable project of imposture and only at last continuedst to live long enough to see by my misjudging and abhorred intervention thy closing hope disappointed and thy death accompanied with the foulest disgrace i began these memoirs with the idea of vindicating my character i have now no character that i wish to vindicate but i will finish them that thy story may be fully understood and that if those errors of thy life be known which thou so ardently desiredst to conceal the world may at least not hear and repeat a halftold and mangled tale the end
