the following observations on  method of curing burns and scalds are obered by the author for the benefit of the public  sd by j fielding paternoster row   observations etc about the year      the author of the following tract being frequently witness to the miseries attending people that had the misfortune to be burned or scalded was induced to apply himself studiously to observe the effects and to find a remedy that would quickly restore nature and one so simple that it might in general be readily adopted in all families  this desideratum was accordingly after many experiments about that time acquired and numbers that have been miserably scorched and scalded have been instantaneously cured by following the authors method  the outer dress of ladies being of late years composed of gauze muslin and other inflammable articles which blaze away so violently when they unfortunately take fire that the most dreadful mischief has ensued too suddenly for prevention the numbers of the unfortunate have much increased with the fashion  how many have of late been most miserably scorched and defaced  how many have suffered a lingering death under the most excruciating tortures  while the methods used as remedies have only served to lengthen the term of their misery  the author presumes that the utility of his method will entitle it to a favorable reception with the public and that there need no apology for the publication  in the use of oil and several other things that are applied as remedies for scalds and burns it may be observed that nature denies their admission into the pores of the skin that the acid perspiration plenty of which is generally upon the surface of the skin together with the continued action of nature through the pores are repellers of several things that would be remedies in these cases  the author surmised that if this acid perspiration was to be overcome or continually washed away as it is produced that applications might then take effect and in consequence of those observations after repeated experiments he laid down the following easy rules which when practiced were never known to fail but many and surprising cures have been performed and so far from giving pain that the pain caused by the burning or scalding ceases immediately on the application whereas such violent pains are produced by the application of spirits and some other things that the remedy is worse than the disease and the patient lingers out a most miserable life and dies the most excruciating of all deaths  take soft soap hard if that is not to be had dissolve it in boiling water exceeding strong in as little water as possible then make it cold immediately by the addition of cold water be careful to observe that there be full six ounces of soap in every gallon of this cold solution and half a dram of sal tartar  then put in the injured part and move it gently about keeping it there half an hour for a recent matter this is sufficient if it be of long standing it may be continued or repeated as occasion requires  mind to have solution in proportion to the nature of the case if a person is scalded or scorched all over he or she may stand or sit up to the chin naked in it and frequently immerge the head or let some person continually pour plentifully of the solution upon the head  in this case it will take  0 or  0 gallons of water and from    lb to    lb of soap with about two ounces of sal tartar  this will be strong enough to take off all greasiness and dirt from the body without rubbing it will keep the injured part soft and cold while the circulation regains its usual or a new course and innate nature repairs the havoc made by the fire  a few cases among many here follow by way of elucidation  a boy having his leg scalded by a panfull of boiling water being thrown upon it after trying various methods for three or four days to no purpose was cured by keeping it in the solution prepared as abovementioned about half an hour so that the pain never returned and the leg healed in a very short time  in like manner a man was cured who burned the skin off his hand and terribly scorched the flesh against a hot plate of iron  the author having accidentally slipped his arm almost up to the elbow into a copper of water that was boiling furiously he put it into cold water which immediately took off the pain which was become excessive while immersed it was benumbed and senseless but when took out of the water the pain returned with great violence  he therefore kept it in this situation while the solution was making as above  the soap being dissolved and cooled well he plunged his hand and arm in it the pain never returned the numbness went off and the limb as it were revivified he continued it in the above solution about    minutes and never after felt the least pain or ill effects from this terrible scald  finis
