synopsis of quadrupeds  heb dduw heb ddim aduw adigon   chester printed by j monk  mdcclxxi  preface the following synopsis was originally intended for private amusement and as an index for the more ready turning to any particular animal in the voluminous history of quadrupeds by m de buffon but as it swelled by degrees to a size beyond my first expectation in the end i was determined to fling it into its present form and to usher it into the world  the synopsis of our illustrious countryman mr ray has been long out of print and though from his enlarged knowledge and great industry one might well suppose his work would for some time discourage all further attempts of the same sort yet a republication of that synopsis would not have answered our present design for living at a period when the study of natural history was but beginning to dawn in these kingdoms and when our contracted commerce deprived him of many lights we now enjoy he was obliged to content himself with giving descriptions of the few animals brought over here and collecting the rest of his materials from other writers yet so correct was his genius that we view a systematic arrangement arise even from the chaos of aldrovandus and gesner under his hand the indigested matter of these able and copious writers assumes a new form and the whole is made clear and perspicuous  from this period every writer on these subjects proposed his own method as an example some openly but others more covertly aiming at the honor of originality and attempting to seek for fame in the path chalked out by mr ray but too often without acknowleging the merit of the guide  mr klein in      made his appearance as a systematic writer on quadrupeds and in his first order follows the general arrangement of mr ray but the change he has made of separating certain animals which the last had consolidated are executed with great judgment he seems less fortunate in his second order for by a servile regard to a method taken from the number of toes he has jumbled together most opposite animals the camel and the sloth the mole and the bat the glutton and apes happy only in throwing back the walrus the seal and the manati to the extremity of his system i suppose as animals nearly bordering on another class  m brisson in      favored the world with another system arranging his animals by the number or defect of their teeth beginning with those that were toothless such as the anteater and ending with those that had the greatest number such as the opossum by this method laudable as it is in many respects it must happen unavoidably that some quadrupeds very distant from each other in their manners are too closely connected in his system a defect which however common should be carefully avoided by every naturalist  in point of time linnaeus ought to have the precedence for he published his first system in      this was followed by several others varying constantly in the arrangement of the animal kingdom even to the last edition of      it is therefore difficult to defend and still more ungrateful to drop any reflections on a naturalist to whom we are so greatly indebted the variations in his different systems may have arisen from the new and continual discoveries that are made in the animal kingdom from his sincere intention of giving his systems additional improvements and perhaps from a failing unknown indeed to many of his accusers a diffidence in the abilities he had exerted in his prior performances but it must be allowed that the naturalist runs too great a hazard in imitating his present guise for in another year he may put on a new form and leave the complying philosopher amazed at the metamorphosis  but this is not my only reason for rejecting the system of this otherwise able naturalist there are faults in his arrangement of mammalia or animals which have paps and suckle their young in which class are comprehended not only all the genuine quadrupeds but even the cetaceous tribe  that oblige me to separate myself in this one instance from his crowd of votaries but that my secession may not appear the effect of whim or envy it is to be hoped that the following objections will have their weight  i reject his first division which he calls primates or chiefs of the creation because my vanity will not suffer me to rank mankind with apes monkies maucaucos and bats the companions linnaeus has allotted us even in this his last system  the second order of bruta i avoid for much the same reason the most intelligent of quadrupeds the halfreasoning elephant is made to associate with the most discordant and stupid of the creation with sloths anteaters and armadillos or with manaties and walruses inhabitants of another element  the third order of ferae is not more admissible in all its articles for it will be impossible to allow the mole the shrew and the harmless hedgehog to be the companions of lions wolves and bears we may err in our arrangement sed non ut placidis coeant immitia non ut serpents avibus geminentur tigribus agni   in his arrangement of his fourth and fifth orders we quite agree except in the single article noctilio a species of bat which happening to have only two cutting teeth in each jaw is separated from its companions and placed with squirrels and others of that class  the sixth order is made up of animals of the hoofed tribe but of genera so different in their nature that notwithstanding we admit them into the same division we place them at such distances from each other with so many intervening links and softening gradations as will it may be hoped lessen the shock of seeing the horse and the hippopotame in the same piece to avoid this as much as possible we have flung the last into the back ground where it will appear more tolerable to the critic than if they were left in a manner conjoined  the last order is that of whales which it must be confessed have in many respects the structure of land animals but their want of hair and feet their fishlike form and their constant residence in the water are arguments for separating them from this class and forming them into another independent of the rest  but while i thus freely offer my objections against embracing this system of quadrupeds let me not be supposed insensible of the other merits of this great and extraordinary person his arrangement of fish of insects and of shells are original and excellent he has in all his classes given philosophy a new language has invented apt names and taught the world a brevity yet a fullness of description unknown to past ages he has with great industry brought numbers of synonyms of every animal into one point of view and has given a concise account of the uses and manners of each as far as his observation extended or the information of a numerous train of traveling disciples could contribute his country may triumph in producing so vast a genius whose spirit invigorates science in all that chilly region and diffuses it from thence to climates more favorable which gratefully acknowledge the advantage of its influences  let us now turn our eyes to a genius of another kind to whom the history of quadrupeds owes very considerable lights i mean m de buffon who in the most beautiful language and in the most agreeable manner has given the amplest descriptions of the economy of the whole fourfooted creation for the anatomical part in the province of m d aubenton  such is his eloquence that we forget the exuberant manner he treats each subject and the reflections he often casts on other writers the creation of his own gay fancy this is not advanced without reason b  in our regard to a gentleman whose abilities we respect  forbear producing our proofs not doubting but when he  had time to recollect himself he will by a recantation of a certain gd misrepresentation convince the public that his candor is not inferior to his learning and genius  having in his own mind a comprehensive view of every animal he unfortunately seems to think it beneath him to shackle his lively spirit with systematic arrangement so that the reader is forced to wander through numbers of volumes in search of any wishedfor subject the misunderstanding between these two able naturalists is most injurious to science the french philosopher scarce mentions the suede but to treat him with contempt linnaeus in return never deigns even to quote m de buffon notwithstanding he must know what ample lights he might have drawn from him  i shall in a few words mention the plan that is followed in the present distribution of quadrupeds and at the same time shall clame but a small share of originality  i copy mr ray in his greater divisions of animals into hoofed and digitated but after the manner of mr klein form separate genera of the rhinoceros hippopotame tapiir and musk the camel being a ruminating animal wanting the upper foreteeth and having the rudiments of hoofs is placed in the first order after the musk a hornless clovenhoofed quadruped  the apes are continued in the same rank mr ray has placed them and are followed by the maucaucos  the carnivorous animals deviate but little from his system and are arranged according to that of linnaeus after omitting the seal mole shrew and hedgehog  the herbivorous or frugivorous quadrupeds keep here the same station that our countryman assigned them but this class comprehends besides the shrew the mole and the hedgehog the mole is an exception to the character of this order in respect to the number of its cutting teeth but its way of life and its food place it here more naturally than with the ferae as linnaeus has done these exceptions are to be met with even in the method such as the trichechus rosmarus which has four distinct grinders in every jaw the phoca ursina and leonina the mustela lutris and the sus hydrochaeris and particularly in the genus of vespertilio which consists of numbers of species many of which vary greatly in the number of their fore teeth of that able naturalist nor can it be otherwise in all human systems we are so ignorant of many of the links of the chains of beings that to expect perfection in the arrangement of them would be the most weak presumption we ought therefore to drop all thoughts of forming a system of quadrupeds from the character of a single part but if we take combined characters of parts manners and food we bid much fairer for producing an intelligible system which ought to be the sum of our aim  the fourth section of digitated quadrupeds consists of those which are absolutely destitute of cutting teeth such as the sloth and armadillo  the fifth section is formed of those which are destitute of teeth of every kind such as the manis and anteater  the third and fourth orders or divisions are the pinnated and the winged quadrupeds the first takes in the walrus and the seals and in conformity to preceding writers the manati but those that compose this order are very imperfect their limbs serve rather the use of sins than legs and their element being for the greatest part the water they seem as the links between the quadrupeds and the cetaceous animals  the bats again are winged quadrupeds and form the next gradation from this to the class of birds and these two orders are the only additions i can boast of adding in this work  so far of system the rest of my plan comprehends numerous synonyms of each animal a brief description and as full an account of their place manners or uses as could be collected from my own observations or the information of others from preceding writers on the subject from printed voyages of the best authorities or from living voyagers and it may be added from the different museums at home and abroad particularly from that matchless collection in the british museum and placed as it is under the direction of gentlemen as much distinguished for their politeness as their love of science my access to its contents has been rendered at all fit times so easy as to put this work under singular obligations to them  if it has the fortune to be anyways useful to my countrymen in promoting the knowledge of natural history my principal object will be answered let it be treated with candor till something better appears and when that time comes the writer will cheerfully resign it to oblivion

motions to give the dogs opportunity of overtaking it in india and in persia a sort of leopard is made use of in the chase this is an animal that takes its prey not by swiftness of foot but by the

probability make it the size of a horse or an auvergne mule which is a very large species and the informations also that i have received from eye witnesses make its height from    to    hands the writers who speak of the european kind confine its bulk to that of a horse those who spea of the gigantic moose say their horns are six fee high josselyn makes the extent from tip to tip t be two fathom and la hontan voy n america i    from hearsay pretends that they weigh from  00 to  00 lb notwithstanding he says that the animal which is t carry them is no larger than a horse thus these writers vary from each other and often are no consistent with themselves it seems then that joselyn and dudly have been too credulous and taken their evidence from huntsmen or indians who were fond of the mavelous for it does not appear tha they had seen it the only thing certain is tha the elk is common to both continents and tha the american having larger forests to range in an more luxuriant food grows to a larger size tha the european in america they are found the rarely in the back parts of new england in the peninsula of nova scotia and in canada in europ they inhabit lapland norway sueden and russia in asia the n e parts of tartary and siberia but in each of those continents inhabit only parts where cold reigns with the utmost rigor during part of the year  they live amidst the forests for the convenience of browzing the boughs of trees for the great length of their legs and the shortness of their neck prevents them from grazing with any sort of ease they often feed on water plants which they can readily get at by wading and m sarrasin martyns abridg mem and hist acad iv     says they are so fond of the anagyris foetida or stinking bn trefoil as to dig for it with their feet when covered with snow  they have a singular gait their pace is a high shambling trot but they go with vast swiftness in old times these animals were made use of in sueden to draw sledges but as they were frequently accessory to the escape of murderers and other criminals the use was prohibited under great penalties in passing through thick woods they carry their heads horizontally to prevent their horns being entangled in the branches in their common walk they raise their fore feet very high that which i saw stepped over a rail near a yard high with great ease  they are very inoffensive animals except when wounded or in the rutting season when they become very furious and at that time swim from isle to isle in pursuit of the females they strike with both horns and hoofs are hunted in canada during winter when they sink so deep in the snow as to become an easy prey the flesh is much commended for being light and nourishing but the nose is reckoned the greatest delicacy in all canada the tongues are excellent and are frequently brought here from russia the skin makes excellent buff leather numbers of the american elk skins are sent from hence to bayonne where they are dressed and sold to the gallegos who make buff waistcoats of them  linnaeus says it will turn a musket ball the hair which is on the neck withers and hams of the full grown elk is of great length and very elastic is used to make matresses the hoofs were supposed to have great virtues in curing epilepsics it was pretended that the elk being subject to that disease cured itself by scratching its ear with its hoof  the elk was known to the romans by the name of alce and machlis they believed that it had no joints in its legs and from the great size of the upper lip imagined it could not feed without going backward as it grazed  before i quit this subject it will be proper to take some notice of the enormous horns that are so often found fossil in ireland and which have always been attributed to the moose deer i mean the moose deer of josselyn for no other animal could possibly be supposed to carry so gigantic a head these horns differ very much from those of the european or american elk the beam or part between the base and the palm is vastly longer each is furnished with a large and palmated brow antler and the snags on the upper palms are longer the measurements of a pair of these horns are as follow from the insertion to the tips   feet   inches the brow antlers    inches the broadest part of the palm    distance between tip and tip   feet   but these are small in comparison of others that have been found in the same kingdom mr wright in his louthiana tab xxii book iii gives the figure of one that was eight feet long and fourteen between point and point these horns are frequent in our museums and at gentlemens houses in ireland but the zoologist is still at a loss for the recent animal i have been informed by a gentleman long resident in hudsons bay that the indians speak of a beast of the moose kind called by the indians waskesseu  but far superior in size to the common one which they say is found   or  00 miles s w of york fort if such an animal exists with horns of the dimensions just mentioned and of proportionable dimensions in other parts there is a chance of seeing josselyns account verified for if our largest elks of seventeen hands high carry horns of scarce three feet in length we may very well allow the animal to be thirtythree hands high which is to support horns of   or  00 lb weight     rein tarandus plinii lib viii c

fossil state some years ago two great grinding teeth and part of the tusk of an elephant were given me by some miners who discovered them at the depth of    yards in a leadmine in flintshire one of the strata above them was limestone about   yards thick the teeth were found in a bed of gravel in the same mine the grinders were almost as perfect as if just taken from the animal the tusk much decayed soft and exfoliating  the grinders and tusks of the mammouth so often found fossil in siberia must be referred to this animal as is evident from the account and figures of those in the ph tr abridg ix    by mr breynius who has given very accurate figures of the entire head the molares the tusk and the thigh bone  the molares differ not in the lest from those recent but the tusk has a curvature far greater than those of any elephant i have seen whether this was accidental or preternatural cannot be determined from a single specimen strablenberg says they are somewhat more crooked hist russia  0  also bells travels ii     le bruns travels i    than elephants teeth commonly are and others relate that a pair weighed  00lb which exceeds the weight of the largest recent tusks there are also found with them fossil grinders of   lb weight but since in all other respects those grinders resemble those of the living elephants and one being found lodged in the skeleton of the same head with the tusks we cannot deny our assent to the opinion of those who think them to have been once the parts of the animal we have just described  these are found lodged in the sandy banks of the siberian rivers sometimes entire skeletons are found the tusks are made use of as ivory formed into combs and used to inlay cabinets the tartars have many wild notions about the mammouth such as its being a subterraneous animal etc etc linnaeus syst not    says it is the skeleton of the walrus flung on shore     american an animal only known in a fossil state and that but partially from the teeth some of the jawbones the thigh bones and vertebrae found with many others five or six feet beneath the surface on the banks of the ohio not remote from the river miame seven hundred miles from the sea coast  some of the tusks near seven feet long one foot nine inches in circumference at the base and one foot near the point the cavity at the root or base nineteen inches deep the tusks of the true elephant have sometimes a very slight lateral bend these have a larger twist or spiral curve toward the smaller end but the great and specific difference consists in the shape of the molares or grinders which are made like those of a carnivorous animal not flat and ribbed transversely on their surface life those of the recent elephant but furnished with a double row of high and conic processes as if intended to masticate not to grind their food  a third difference is in the thigh bone which is of a great disproportionable thickness to that of the elephant and has also some anatomical variations  the tusks have been cut and polished by the workers in ivory who affirmed that in texture and appearance they differed not from the true ivory the molares were indurated to a great degree specimens of these teeth and bones are deposited in the british museum that of the royal society and in the cabinet of doctor hunter who has obliged the world with an ingenious essay on the subject vide ph tr vol lviii    the late worthy  collinson in the preceding volume gave us other notices of those bones  i should have been less accurate in this description had not that gentleman favored me with his observations on some particulars which otherwise might have escaped my notice  these fossil bones are also found in peru and in the brazils as yet the living animal has evaded our

from a drawing not from nature  linnaeus places this among the simiae cauda elongata and applies to it some of the synonyms of the d species but his description agrees with this so exactly that there can be no doubt but that it is his simia maimon  this animal is well described by m de buffon mr  linnaeus and m brisson and indeed every naturalist except m de buffon has copied gesner but we think the first ought to have applied the name of baboon to this species instead of that described by him p     the one having the character of this section the other having a length of tail that

short tail and of a mouse color that it grows to the size of five feet is very fierce and will even attack a man  the mandrill mentioned by smith in his voyage to guinea is another kind probably only a variety of the smitten he says it grows to a vast size the body as thick as that of a man the teeth large and yellow head vastly large face broad and flat wrinkled and covered with a white skin nose always running body covered with long black hair like a bear m de buffoon makes this last synonymous with his mandrill but both the size and length of hair and greatness of the head show them to be of a very different species  the tretretretre of madagascar is another animal of this kind described to be of the size of a calf of two years old to have a round head visage and ears of a man feet of an

to bake their bread in each party also has an interpreter for the country they penetrate into every party then sets out according to the course their chief points out they go against the stream of the rivers drawing their boats up till they arrive in the hunting country there they stop build huts and wait till the waters are frozen and the season commences before they begin the chase their leader  them they unite in a prayer to the almighty  success and then separate the first sable they take is called gods sable and is dedicated to the church  they then penetrate into the woods mark the trees as they advance that they may know their way back and in their hunting quarters form huts of trees and bank up the snow round them near these they lay their traps then advance farther and lay more traps still building new huts in every quarter and return successively to every old one to visit the traps and take out the game to skin it which none but the chief of the party must do during this time they are supplied with provisions by persons who are employed to bring it on sledges from the places on the road where they are obliged to form magazines by reason of the impracticability of bringing quantities through the rough country they must pass the traps are a sort of pitfall with a loose board placed over it baited with fh or flesh when sables grow scarce the huntrs trace them in the new fallen snow to their holes place their nets at the entrance and sometimes wait watching two or three days for the comg out of the animal it has happened that these poor people have by the

sables are in season from november to february for those caught at any other time of the year are short haird and then called nedosobo the hair of sables differs in length and quality the long hairs which reach far beyond the inferior ones are called os the more a skin has of such long hairs the blacker they are and the more valuable is the fur the very best have no other but those long and black hairs motchka is a technical term in the russian fur trade expressing the lower part of the long hairs and sometimes it comprehends likewise the lower and shorter hairs the above mentioned best sable furs are said to have a black motchka below the long hairs are in the greater parts of sable furs some shorter hairs called podosie i e underos the more podosie a fur has the less valuable in the better kind of sables the podosie has black tips and a gray or rusty motchka the first kind of motchka makes the middling kind of sablo furs the red one the worst especially if it has but few os between the os and podosie is a low wooly kind of hair called podsada the more podsada a fur has the less valuable for the long hair will in such case take no other direction than the natural one for the character of sables is that notwithstanding the hair naturally lies from the head toward the tail yet will lie equally in any direction as you strike your hand over it the various combinations of these characters in regard to os motchka podosie and podsada make many special divisions of the goodness of furs besides this the furriers attend to the size preserving always caeteris paribus the biggest and those that have the greatest gloss the size depends upon the animal being a male or female the latter being always smaller the gloss vanishes in old furs the fresh ones have a kind of bloomy appearance as they express it the old ones are said to have done blooming the died sables always lose their gloss become less uniform whether the lower hairs have taken the dye or not and commonly the hairs are somewhat twisted or crisped and not so strait as in the natural ones some fumigate the skins to make them look blacker but the smell and the crisped condition of the long hair betrays the cheat and both ways are detected by rubbing the fur with a moist linen cloth which grows black in such cases  the chinese have a way of dying the sables so that the color not only lasts which the russian cheats cannot do but the fur keeps its gloss and the crisped hairs only discover it this is the reason that all the sables which are of the best kind either in pairs or separate are carried to russia the rest go to china the very best sables come from the environs of nertchitsk and yakutsk and in this latter district the country about the river ud affords sometimes sables of whom

first by driving into the ground stakes five or six feet long placed rows wattling each row with pliant twigs and filling the interstices with clay ramming it down close the side next the water is sloped the other perpendicular the bottom is from ten to twelve fee thick but the thickness gradually diminishes to the top which is about two or three the length o these dams is sometimes not less than a hundred feet  their houses are made in the water collected by means of the dam and are placed near the edge of the shore they are built on piles are either round or oval but the tops are vaulted so that their inside resembles an oven the top a dome the walls are two feet thick made of earth stones and sticks most artificially laid together and the walls within as neatly plaistered as if with a trowel in each house are two openings one into the water the other toward the land the height of these houses above the water is eight feet they often make two or three stories in each dwelling for the convenience of change in case of floods each house contains from two to thirty beavers and the number of houses in each pond is from ten to twentyfive each beaver forms its bed of

their feet scrape holes in order to place them in while others exert their efforts to rear them in their proper places another party is employed in collecting twigs to wattle the piles with a third in collecting earth stones and clay a fourth is busied in beating and tempering the mortar others in carrying it on their broad tails to proper places and with the same instrument ram it between the

every other part of the pacific ocean  they inhabit from june to september the isles that are scattered in the seas between kamtschatka and america in order to copulate and bring forth their young in full security the accurate and indefatigable naturalist steller was the first who gave an exact description of them he and his companions in the russian expedition of      were in all probability the first europeans who gave them any disturbance in those their retreats in september these animals quit their stations vastly emaciated some return to the asiatic others to the american shores but like the sea otters are confined in those seas between lat  0 and     the ursine seal a name we substitute for the sea bear leads during the three months in summer a most indolent life it arrives at the islands vastly fat but during that time they are scarce ever in motion confine themselves for whole weeks to one spot sleep a great part of the time eat nothing and except the employment the females have in suckling their young are totally inactive they live in families each male has from eight to fifty females whom he guards with the jealousy of an eastern monarch and though they lie by thousands on the shores each family keeps itself separate from the rest and sometimes with the young and unmarried ones amount to a hundred and twenty the old animals which are destitute of females or deserted by them live apart and are excessively splenetic peevish and quarrelsome are excessively fierce and so attached to their old haunts that they would die sooner than quit them they are monstrously fat and have a most hircine smell if another approaches their station they are rouzed from their indolence and instantly snap at it and a battle ensues in the conflict they perhaps intrude on the seat of another this gives new cause of offense so in the end the discord becomes universal and is spread through the whole shore  the other males are also very irascible the causes of their disputes are generally these the first and the most terrible is when an attempt is made by another to seduce one of their mistresses or a young female of the family this insult produces a combat and the conqueror is immediately followed by the whole seraglio who are sure of deserting the unhappy vanquished the second reason of a quarrel is when one invades the seat of another the third arises from their interfering in the disputes of others these battles are very violent the wounds they receive are very deep and resemble the cuts of a sabre at the end of a fight they fling themselves into the sea to wash away the blood  the males are very fond of their young but very tyrannical toward the females if any body attempts to take their cub the male stands on the defensive while the female makes off with the young in her mouth should she drop it the former instantly quits his enemy falls on her and beats her against the stones till he leaves her for dead as soon as she recovers she comes in the most suppliant manner to the male crawls to his feet and washes them with her tears he in the mean time stalks about in the most insulting manner but in case the young one is carried off he melts into the deepest affliction and shows all signs of deep concern it is probable that he feels his misfortune the more sensisibly as the female generally brings but one at a time never more than two  they swim very swiftly at the rate of seven miles an hour if wounded will seize on the boat and carry it along with vast impetuosity and oftentimes fink it they can continue a long time under water when they want to climb the rocks they fasten with the fore paws and so draw themselves up they are very tenacious of life and will live for a fortnight after receiving such wounds as would immediately destroy any other animal  descr the male of this species is vastly superior in size to the female the bodies of each are of a conic form very thick before and taper to the tail the

think a great delicacy  these animals associate in families like the former but not in such great numbers the males show equal jealousy about their mistresses and have bloody combats on their accounts

out to sea but presently return again they live in families one near another each consists of a male a female a halfgrown young one and a very small one the females oblige the young to swim before them while the other old ones surround and as it were guard them on all sides the affection between the male and female is very great for if she is attacked he will defend her to the utmost and if she is killed will follow her corpse to the very shore and swim for some days near the place it has been landed at  they copulate in the spring in the same manner as the human kind especially in calm weather toward the evening the female swims gently about the male pursues till tired with wantoning she flings herself on her back and admits his embraces the leonine and ursine seals copulate in the same manner only after sporting in the sea for some time they come on shore for that purpose  steller thinks they go with young above a year it is certain that they bring but one young at a time which they suckle by two teats placed between the breast  they are vastly voracious and gluttonous and feed not only on the fuci that grow in the sea but such as are flung on the edges of the shore when they are filled they fall asleep on their backs during their meals they are so intent on their food that any one may go among them and choose which he likes best peter martyr gives an instance of one

ribs they are taken by harpoons fastened to a strong cord and after they are struck it requires the united force of thirty men to draw them on shore sometimes when they are transfixed they will lay hold of the rocks with their paws and stick so fast as to leave the skin behind before they can be forced off when a manati is struck its companions swim to its assistance some will attempt to overturn the boat by getting under it others will press down the rope in order to break it and others will strike at the harpoon with their tails with a view of getting it out which they often succeed
