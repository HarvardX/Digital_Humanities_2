the maid of the mill a comic opera as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden the music compiled and the words written by the author of love in a village  london printed for j newbery r baldwin t caslon w griffin w nicoll t lownds and t becket mdcclxv  to his royal highness william duke of gloucester may it please your royal highness when i presumed to solicit the honor of laying the subsequent trifle at your royal highnesss feet it was not without a thorough consciousness of the little value of the offering i was going to make but i considered mean as it was it would serve as a testimony of my devotion and to a prince happy in a love of the arts nothing could be unacceptable which bore the remotest analogy to them  how far the comic opera under proper regulations has a right to be acknowledged for a junior offspring of the drama and as such become candidate for a share of public encouragement i shall not pretend to determine but if it can be rendered an agreeable amusement the english theater has never scrupled to adopt what was capable of pleasing there and though as a work of genius it is by no means to be set in competition with good tragedies and comedies it may i apprehend be permitted as an occasional relief to them without bringing either our taste or understanding into question  i need not inform your royal highness that in france where the stage has been cultivated with more care and success than in any other country this species of entertainment is received with very great applause nor is it thought any injury to corneille and moliere that the pieces of anseaume and favart meet with success  it is true among the french comic operas have very often the advantage of being extremely well written of which on ne savise jamais de tout le roy et le fermier and some others are an instance nor would the best composition of the greatest master make a very contemptible poem pass on an audience i wish i could assert with truth that in this respect we fall nothing behind our neighbors and that what i here present to your royal highness might lay claim to some degree of merit even in the writing but though i cannot do this permit me to say i have attempted to render it a little interesting and not wholly undiverting as far as the music my principal care would give me leave  but i humbly beg your royal highnesss pardon in applying to the connoisseur i forget that i am at the same time addressing a great prince indeed there is a subject on which i could dwell with the truest pleasure but i am too well instructed in your royal highnesss character to dare to offend you with a language which forms and custom too often impose upon princes a necessity of hearing i mean their own praise to those who are most deserving ever least welcome  i therefore subscribe myself with the profoundest respect may it please your royal highness your royal highnesss most obedient most devoted and most humble servant the author  the preface there is scarce a language in europe in which there is not a play taken from our romance of pamela in italian and french particularly several writers of the first eminence have chosen it for the subject of different dramas  the little piece now ventured into the world owes its origin to the same source not only the general subject is drawn from pamela but almost every circumstance in it the reader will immediately recollect  the courtship of parson williams  the squires jealousy and behavior in consequence of it and the difficulty he had to prevail with himself to marry the girl notwithstanding his passion for her  the miller is a close copy of goodman andrews  ralph is imagined from the wild son which he is mentioned to have had  theodosia from the young lady of quality with whom mr b through his sisters persuasion is said to have been in treaty before his marriage with pamela  even the gypsies are borrowed from a trifling incident in the latter part of the work  in prosecuting this plan which he has varied from the original as far as he thought convenient the author has made simplicity his principal aim his scenes on account of the music which could not be perfect without such a mixture necessarily consist of serious and buffoon he knows grossness and insipidity lay in his way whether he has had art enough to avoid stumbling upon them the candid public is left to determine  this opera is entered at stationers hall and whoever presumes to print the songs or any part of them will be prosecuted by the proprietors  dramatis personae men lord aimworth mr

first yonder is your shovel your sacks too i throw you hence forward take care of your matters who will they are welcome to slave for your wages that need em tol lol derol lol i have purchased my freedom and never hereafter shall work at the mill  scene ii fairfield and patty fairf dear heart dear heart i protest this ungracious boy puts me quite beside myself patty my dear come down into the yard a little and keep me company  and you thieves vagabonds gypsies out here it is you debauch my son   patty air in love to pine and languish yet know your passion vain to harbor heartfelt anguish yet fear to tell your pain what powers unrelenting severer ills inventing can sharpen pangs like these where days and nights tormenting yield not a moments ease  fairf well patty master goodman my lords steward has been with me just now and i find we are like to have great doings his lordship has brought down sir harry sycamore and his family and there is more company expected in a few days   patty i know sir harry very well he is by marriage a distant relation of my lords   fairf pray what sort of a young body is the daughter there i think she used to be with you at the castle three or four summers ago when my young lord was out upon his travels   patty oh very often she was a great favorite of my ladys pray father is she come down   fairf why you know the report last night about my lords going to be married by what i can learn she is and there is likely to be a nearer relationship between the families ere long it seems his lordship was not over willing for the match but the friends on both sides in london pressed it so hard then there is a swinging fortune master goodman tells me a matter of twenty or thirty thousand pounds   patty if it was a million father it would not be more than my lord aimworth deserves i suppose the wedding will be celebrated here at the mansion house   fairf so it is thought as soon as things can be properly prepared  and now patty if i could but see thee a little merry  come bless thee pluck up thy spirits  to be sure thou has sustained in the death of thy lady a heavy loss she was a parent to thee nay and better inasmuch as she took thee when thou were but a babe and gave thee an education which thy natural parents could not afford to do   patty ah dear father dont mention what perhaps has been my greatest misfortune   fairf nay then patty what is become of all thy sense that people talk so much about  but i have something to say to thee which i would have thee consider seriously  i believe i need not tell thee my child that a young maiden after she is marriageable especially if she has any thing about her to draw peoples notice is liable to ill tongues and a many cross accidents so that the sooner she is out of harms way the better   patty undoubtedly father there are people enough who watch every opportunity to gratify their own malice but when a young womans conduct is unblameable    fairf why patty there may be something in that but you know slander will leave spots where malice finds none i say then a young womans best safeguard is a good husband now there is our neighbor farmer giles he is a sober honest industrious young fellow and one of the wealthiest in these parts he is greatly taken with thee and it is not the first time i have told thee i should be glad to have him for a soninlaw   patty and i have told you as often father i would submit myself entirely to your direction whatever you think proper for me is so   fairf why that is spoken like a dutiful sensible girl get thee in then and leave me to manage it  perhaps our neighbor giles is not a gentleman but what are the greatest part of our country gentlemen good for   patty very true father the sentiments indeed have frequently little correspondence with the condition and it is according to them alone we ought to regulate our esteem  air what are outward forms and shows to an honest heart compared often the rustic wanting those has the nobler portion shared often we see the homely flower bearing at the hedges side virtues of more sovereign power than the gardens gayest pride  scene iii fairfield giles giles well master fairfield you and miss pat have had a long discourse together did you tell her that i was come down   fairf no in truth friend giles i did not even tell her i had sent for thee but i mentioned our affair at a distance and i think there is no fear but what it will go as agreeably of her side as we could wish   giles that is right  well and when shall us  you do know i have told you my mind often and often   fairf farmer give us thy hand nobody doubts thy good will to me and my girl and you may take my word i would rather give her to thee than another for i am main certain thou will make her a good husband   giles thanks to your kind opinion master fairfield if such be my hap i hope there will be no cause of complaint   fairf and i promise thee my daughter will make thee a choice wife  but there is one thing to be considered  thou know friend giles that i and all belongs to me have great obligations to lord aimworths family patty in particular would be one of the most ungrateful wretches this day breathing if she was to do the smallest thing contrary to their consent and approbation  i need not tell thee what she owes them   giles nay nay it is well enough known to all the country she was the old ladys darling   fairf well master giles i will assure thee she is not one whit less obliged to my lord himself  when his mother was taken off so suddenly and his affairs called him up to london if patty would have remained at the castle she might have had the command of all or if she would have gone any where else he would have paid for her fixing let the cost be what it would   giles why for that matter folks did not spare to say that my lord had a kind of a sneaking kindness for her himself and i remember at one time it was rise all about the neighborhood that she was actually to be our lady   fairf pho pho a pack of womens tales   giles nay to be sure they will say any thing   fairf my lords a man of a better way of thinking friend giles  but this is neither here nor there to our business  have you been at the castle yet   giles who i bless your heart i did not hear a syllable of his lordships being come down till your lad told me   fairf no why then i will tell you what you shall do go up to my lord let him know you have a mind to make a match with my daughter hear what he has to say to it and afterward we will try if we cannot settle matters   giles go up to my lord icod if that be all i will do it with the biggest pleasure in life   fairf suppose you were to go this morning   giles this minute an you will never fear me i warrant i shall not be shamed faced  but where is miss pat might not one ax her how she do do   fairf never spare it she is within there   giles i sees her  odd rabbit it this hatch is locked now  miss pat  miss patty  she makes believe not to hear me   fairf well well never mind thou wilt come and eat a morsel of dinner with us   giles nay but just to have a bit of joke with her at present  miss pat i say  will not you open the door  air hark it is i your own true lover after walking three long miles one kind look at least discover come and speak a word to giles you alone my heart i fix on ah you little cunning vixen i can see your roguish smiles addslids my mind is so possessed till we are sped i shall not have rest only say the things a bargain here an you like it ready to strike it there is at once an end of arguing i am hers she is mine thus we seal and thus we sign  scene iv fairfield patty fairf get away and finish the business thou art going about i warrant we shall not disagree  so this now is just as i would have it  patty child why would not thou open the door for our neighbor giles   patty really father i did not know what was the matter   fairf well another time he will be here again presently he is gone up to the castle patty thou know it would not be right for us to do any thing without giving his lordship intelligence so i have sent the farmer to let him know that he is willing and we are willing and with his lordships approbation    patty oh dear father  what are you going to say   fairf nay child i would not have stirred a step for fifty pounds without advertising his lordship beforehand   patty but surely surely you have not done this rash this precipitate thing   fairf how rash how is it rash patty i dont understand thee   patty oh you have distressed me beyond imagination  but why would you not give me notice speak to me first   fairf why have not i spoken to thee an hundred times no patty it is thou that would distress me and thou wilt break my heart   patty dear father   fairf all i desire is to see thee well settled and now that i am likely to do so thou art not contented i am sure the farmer is as sightly a clever lad as any in the country and is not he as good as we   patty i dont say to the contrary father i know i have no higher pretensions and you have a right to dispose of me as you think proper   fairf well then what harm was there in sending him to his lordship seeing one or other of us must have gone   patty it is very true father i am to blame pray forgive me   fairf forgive thee lord help thee my child i am not angry with thee but quiet thyself patty and thou wilt see all this will turn out for the best   scene v patty what will become of me  my lord will certainly imagine this is done with my consent  well is he not himself going to be married to a lady suitable to him in rank suitable to him in fortune as this farmer is to me and under what pretense can i refuse the husband my father has found for me shall i say that i have dared to raise my inclinations above my condition and presumed to love where my duty taught me only gratitude and respect alas who could live in the house with lord aimworth see him converse with him and not love him i have this consolation however my folly is yet undiscovered to any else how should i be ridiculed and despised nay would not my lord himself despise me especially if he knew that i have more than once construed his natural affability and politeness into sentiments as unworthy of him as mine are bold and extravagant unexampled vanity did i possess any thing capable of attracting such a notice to what purpose could a man of his distinction cast his eyes on a girl poor meanly born and indebted for every thing to the illplaced bounty of his family  air ah why should fate pursuing a wretched thing like me heap ruin thus on ruin and add to misery the griefs i languishd under in secret let me share but this new stroke of thunder is more than i can bear  scene vi changes to a saloon in lord aimworths house sir harry sycamore theodosia sir har well but theodosia child you are quite unreasonable   theo pardon me papa it is not i am unreasonable when i gave way to my inclinations for mr mervin he did not seem less agreeable to you and my mama than he was acceptable to me it is therefore you have been unreasonable in first encouraging his addresses and afterward forbidding him your house in order to bring me down here to force me on a gentleman    sir har force you dossy what do you mean by the la i would not force you on the czar of muscovy   theo and yet papa what else can i call it for though lord aimworth is extremely attentive and obliging i assure you he is by no means one of the most ardent of lovers   sir har ardent ah there it is you girls never think there is any love without kissing and hugging but you should consider child my lord aimworth is a polite man and has been abroad in france and italy where these things are not the fashion i remember when i was on my travels among the madames and signoras we never saluted more than the tip of the ear   theo really papa you have a very strange opinion of my delicacy i had no such stuff in my thoughts   sir har well come my poor dossy i see you are chagrind but you know it is not my fault on the contrary i assure you i had always a great regard for young mervin and should have been very glad    theo how then papa could you join in forcing me to write him that strange letter never to see me more or how indeed could i comply with your commands what must he think of me   sir har ay but hold dossy your mama convinced me that he was not so proper a soninlaw for us as lord aimworth   theo convinced you ah my dear papa you were not convinced   sir har what dont i know when i am convinced   theo why no papa because your goodnature and easiness of temper is such that you pay more respect to the judgment of mama and less to your own than you ought to do   sir har well but dossy dont you see how your mama loves me if my finger does but ach she is like a bewitched woman and if i was to die i dont believe she would outlive the burying of me nay she has told me as much herself   theo her fondness indeed is very extraordinary   sir har besides could you give up the prospect of being a countess and mistress of this fine place   theo yes truly could i  air with the man that i love was i destined to dwell on a mountain a moor in a cot in a cell retreats the most barren most desert would be more pleasing than courts or a palace to me let the vain and the venal in wedlock aspire to what folly esteems and the vulgar admire i yield them the bliss where their wishes are placed insensible creatures it is all they can taste  scene vii sir harry theodosia lady sycamore la syc sir harry where are you   sir har here my lamb   la syc i am just come from looking over his lordships family jewels i protest they are prodigiously magnificent  well miss sycamore you

the possession of any such trumpery   la syc upon my word miss you have a very disdainful manner of expressing yourself i believe there are very few young women of fashion who would think any sacrifice they could make too much for them  did you ever hear the like of her sir harry   sir har why my dear i have just been talking to her in the same strain but whatever she has got in her head she seems to think    la syc oh i know very well what she has got in her head it is mr mervin her gentleman of bucklersbury fie miss marry a cit where is your pride your vanity have you nothing of the person of distinction about you   sir har well but my lady you know i am a piece of a cit myself as i may say for my great grandfather was a dry salter   theo and yet madam you condescended to marry my papa   la syc well if i did miss i had but five thousand pounds to my portion and sir harry knows i was past eight and thirty before i would listen to him   sir har nay dossy that is true your mama owned eight and thirty before we were married but by the la my dear you were a lovely angel and by candlelight nobody would have taken you for above five and twenty   la syc sir harry you remember the last time i was at my lord dukes   sir har yes my love it was the very day your little bitch minxey pupt   la syc well and what did the whole family say my lord john and my lord thomas and my lady duchess in particular cousin says her grace to me  for she always calls me cousin   sir har and me too her grace is exceedingly kind  she always calls me cousin   la syc in short they all said that this match if my prudence could bring it about was the most desirable in the universe and the other absolutely below our attention  a fellow that will have an estate got by selling mundungus and mollossus    theo well but madam be their quality ever so great i cannot see what right my lord john and my lord thomas have to direct my inclinations and i must tell you there is a much nearer relation of mine and one who has a better right to rule me that is my father who has a great regard for mr mervin and would consent to our union with all his heart   la syc did you say so sir harry   sir har who i love   la syc then all my care and prudence are come to nothing   sir har well but stay my lady  dossy you are always making mischief   theo ah my dear sweet    la syc do miss that is right coax    theo no madam i am not capable of any such meanness   la syc it is very civil of you to contradict me however   sir har eh what is that  hands off dossy dont come near me  air why how now miss pert do you think to divert my anger by fawning and stroking would you make me a fool your play thing your tool was ever young minx so provoking get out of my sight twould be serving you

couple however their daughter is perfectly amiable in every respect and yet i am sorry i have brought her down here for can i in honor marry her while my affections are engaged to another to what does the pride of condition and the censure of the world force me must i then renounce the only person that can make me happy because because what because she is a millers daughter vain pride and unjust censure has she not all the graces that education can give her sex improved by a genius seldom found among the highest has she not modesty sweetness of temper and beauty of person capable of adorning a rank the most exalted but it is too late to think of these things now my hand is promised my honor engaged and if it was not so she has engaged herself the farmer is a person to her mind and i have authorized their union by my approbation  air the mad man thus at times we see with seeming reason blessed his looks his words his thoughts are free and speak a mind at rest but short the calms of

of my own heart in my favor and i think was it to do again i should act as i have done let us see what have we here perhaps a book may compose my thoughts reads and throws the book away it is to no

entitled you to look higher   patty your lordship is pleased to overrate my little merit the education i received in your family does not entitle me to forget my origin and the farmer is my equal   l

who think nobly are noble   patty the farmer my lord is a very honest man   l aim so he may i dont suppose he would break into a house or commit a robbery on the highway what do you tell me of his honesty for   patty i did not mean to offend your lordship   l aim offend i am not offended patty not at all offended  but is there any great merit in a mans being honest   patty i dont say there is my lord   l aim the farmer is an ill bred illiterate booby and what happiness can you propose to yourself in such a society then as to his person i am sure  but perhaps patty you like him and if so i

love end but with your lives   l aim rise patty rise say no more  i suppose you will wait upon miss sycamore before you go away  at present i have a little business  as i said patty dont afflict yourself i have been somewhat hasty with regard to the farmer but since i see how deeply you are interested in his affairs i may possibly alter my designs with regard to him  you know  you know patty your marriage with him is no concern of mine  i only speak   air my passion in vain i attempt to dissemble the endeavor to hide it but makes it appear enraptured i gaze when i touch her i tremble and speak to and hear her with faultring and fear by how many cruel ideas tormented my bloods in a ferment it freezes it burns this moment i wish what the next is repented while love rage and jealousy

of those that have too much of them  lord lord how sorry i be  but hold she says i baint to her mind  may not all this be the effect of modish coyness to do like the gentlewomen because she was bred among them and i have heard say they will be upon their vixen tricks till they go into the very church with a man icod there is nothing more likelier for it is the cry of one and all that she is the moral of a lady in every thing and our farmers daughters for the matter of that thof they have nothing to boast of but a scrap of red ribbon about their hats will have as many turnings and windings as a hare before one can lay a fast hold of them there can no harm come of speaking with master fairfield howsoever odd rabbit it how plaguey tart she was  i am half vexed with my myself now that i let her go off so  air when a maid in way of marriage first is courted by a man let un do the best he can she is so shamefacd in her carriage it is with pain the suits began thof mayhap she likes him

indeed madam it had one circumstance attending it which is often wanting to more polite amusements that of seeming to give undissembled satisfaction to those who were engaged in it   theo oh infinite infinite to see the cheerful healthy looking creatures toil with such a good will to me there were more genuine charms in their awkward stumping and jumping about their rude measures and homespun

into the young mans head that was to marry her that you would never have made her a present so much above her deserts and expectations if it had not been upon some naughty account now my lord i am a poor man it is true and a mean one but i and my father and my fathers father have lived tenants upon your lordships estate where we have always been known for honest men and it shall never be said

rejection of which does you so much credit you may take my word however that your fears upon this occasion are entirely groundless but this is not enough as i have been the means of losing your

squeamish   fairf to be sure my lord you have in all honest ways a right to dispose of me and mine as you think proper   l aim go then immediately and bring patty hither i shall not be easy till i

icod i will take the way to the castle as well as the rest for i would fain see how the nail do drive it is well i had wit enough to discern things and a friend to advise with or else she would have fallen to my lot  but i have got a surfeit of going a courting and burn me if i will not live a bachelor for when all comes to all i see nothing but ill blood and quarrels among folk when they be married  air then hey for a frolicksome life i will ramble where pleasures are rife strike up with the free hearted lasses and never think more of a wife plague on it men are but asses to run after

ridicule that may be thrown on a lords marrying a millers daughter and i own with blushes it has for some time had too great weight with me but we should marry to please ourselves not other people and
