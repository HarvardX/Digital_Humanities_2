the importance of religious knowledge to the happiness of mankind a sermon preached before the society for propagating christian knowledge at their anniversary meeting in the high church of edinburgh on monday january      0 and published at their desire  by hugh blair am one of the ministers of canongate  to which is subjoined a short account of the present state of the society  edinburgh printed by r fleming for a kincaid mdccl  a sermon preached in the highchurch of edinburgh before the society for propagating christian knowledge isaiah xi   they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea this passage of scripture is understood by all christian interpreters to refer to the days of the gospel the prophet is describing in the context the influence of the messiahs reign extending through all nature and producing universal happiness this in its full accomplishment doubtless is yet future and respects some more advanced period of the kingdom of god foretold in other passages of the prophetic writings when true religion shall universally prevail and the native tendency of the gospel attain its entire effect in the prospect of this the prophet seems to rise above himself and celebrates those happy days in the most sublime figurative strain of eastern poetry he opens a beautiful view of the state of the world as a state of returning innocence he represents all nature flourishing in peace discord and guile abolished the most hostile natures reconciled and the most savage tamed and reformed the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall ly down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall ly down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for assigning in the text the cause of this great and happy revolution the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea  upon reading these words we must immediately perceive the great encouragement they give to all good designs for promoting religion in the world when we engage in this cause we have the comfort not only of being engaged in a good cause but also in one that will undoubtedly be successful for we are here assured by the divine promise that truth and goodness shall at length prevail and the increasing light and influence of religion prove the cause of general order and happiness it is a noble and animating thought that in such designs we cooperate with god for advancing the kingdom of the messiah and work upon his plan with all the force of eternal providence on our side nor ought we to be discouraged by those unfavourable circumstances which at present seem to make against us though the ignorance superstition and corruption that now fill so much of the world have a dark and mysterious aspect it is not beyond the power of that supreme being who brings light out of darkness to unravel all those perplexed appearances and gradually to extricate mankind from the labyrinth of vice and error from the present state of the world it is not more unlikely that the gospel shall one day be universally received and exert its entire influence on the hearts of men than once it was that it should reach so far and demolish so much established superstition as it has already done at the rise of christianity there was as great a disproportion betwixt the apparent human causes and the effect which has been actually produced as there is in our times betwixt the circumstances of religion in the world and the effect which we farther expect the sun of righteousness having exerted its influence so far in breaking through the thickest darkness we may justly hope that it is powerful enough to dispel all remaining obscurity and that it will ascend by degrees to that perfect day when healing shall be under its wings to all the nations a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in its time isa lx      besides this encouragement to our endeavors for advancing religion there is to be observed in the text a precise connection marked betwixt the increase of religious knowledge and the happiness of mankind the knowledge of the lord filling the earth is distinctly assigned as the cause why they shall not hurt nor destroy in all gods holy mountain to this i am principally to lead your thoughts as a subject properly suited to the occasion of our meeting and peculiarly necessary as i conceive to be inculcated in the present times which seem to be waxing indifferent more and more to all religious principles whether christianity shall be propagated further or not is treated as a matter of no great concern to mankind opinions prevail that moral virtue may subsist with equal advantage independent of religion for moral principles great regard is pretended but articles of religious belief are thought abstract things remote from life points of mere speculation and debate of very inconsiderable influence on the actions of men the general conduct of mankind it is argued will always proceed upon principles and views of another nature and therefore religious knowledge stands in no necessary connection with their improvement or happiness fact and experience is alleged for this even amongst many who would not be ranged on the side of unbelief this loose and indifferent spirit too much prevails and hence the profession of religion amongst us is too visibly sinking into disrepute how adverse all this is to the design which the present discourse is intended to recommend needs not be said how adverse it is to the general welfare and most real interests of mankind i hope shall be made evident to candid minds  by the knowledge of the lord is not to be understood the natural knowledge of god only it is plain the prophet speaks of those times of the messiah when more enlarged discoveries should be made to mankind of the divine perfections and of the measures of the divine administration than mere unassisted reason could reach our natural notices of god and religion are not laid aside by christianity but cleared from error confirmed by higher evidence and carried into a wider field in this enlarged sense of religious knowledge to make its importance to the happiness of mankind appear let us consider man i as an individual and ii as a member of society   i considering man in his single capacity as an individual our inquiry shall here begin of what importance it is to him to have just and true principles of religious belief this divides itself unto two grand branches with respect first to his improvement and next to his consolation    as to the real improvement of man the advancement of his nature in what is morally valuable and useful the acquisition of such dispositions and habits as fit him for acting his part well on this stage and prepare him for a higher state of life and action hereafter what benefit does he receive in these respects from religious knowledge and belief it must be obvious that all increase of knowledge is improvement to the understanding the further its sphere extends the more objects that are submitted to its view and contemplation especially when those objects are of intrinsic excellence the more that understanding power which is the glory of man is in the course of attaining its proper strength and maturity hence truth is justly said to be the food of the soul but were the knowledge of religion merely speculative though the speculation must be allowed to be noble yet less could be said of its importance we recommend it to mankind as forming their hearts pure and exalted conceptions of the deity such as religion gives us  the universal father and righteous governor of the universe  the author of every good and perfect gift himself the standard of unspotted perfection and goodness  conducting his whole administration with an eternal regard to order virtue and truth  ever favoring the cause and supporting the interests of righteousness and righteous men  and applying to this the whole force of omnipotence and the whole art of unerring wisdom from the beginning to the end of things  such conceptions of the deity naturally descend into the heart kindle in it the love of goodness and establish a persuasion of its being our highest interest they give a peculiar strength and fortitude to the mind in the practice of virtue and they promote a cheerful acquiescence in this supremely wise and righteous administration whatever trials and sufferings may arise  all the doctrines peculiar to christian revelation are great improvements of what the light of nature imperfectly suggests a dispensation of providence is made known to us particularly suited to the exigencies of man calculated for recovering him from that corrupt and guilty state into which experience bears witness that he is fallen and restoring him to a state of integrity and favor with his creator the method of carrying on this great plan is such as gives us the most affecting views of the importance of holiness and goodness and of the high account in which it stands with god the son of god appearing on the earth and dying as a propitiation for the sins of the world that he might bring in everlasting righteousness dan ix     that he might purge our consciences from dead works to serve the living god heb ix     that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works tit ii     such a gracious and merciful interposition of the creator of the world so distinguishing a proof of his concern for the moral interests of mankind is most proper to warm the heart with devotion and adds to the cause of goodness the force of every motive from gratitude and ingenuous affection these discoveries of the gospel have this further effect to establish an unshaken confidence in god they afford something to the mind on which it can lay hold as the security of its hope when with a certainty far beyond that of mere abstract argument it appeals to matter of fact and is taught to say he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things romans viii     hence the great encouragement to the repentance and reformation of sinners from the hope of acceptance with god through jesus christ and from the belief of a divine assistance communicated to the upright in heart whilst the government of god is thus rendered most amiable placed in a light most encouraging to every virtuous mind there is at the same time something extremely awful and solemn in the whole doctrine of the redemption it naturally strikes the mind with reverence for the divine law pointing at some deep malignity in sin some dreadful consequences flowing from it unknown perhaps in their causes and in their whole extent to the human mind which moved the creator of the world to depart from the ordinary laws of providence and to undertake the restoration of guilty creatures by a method so astonishing hence mankind are awakened to serious reflection hence such views arise of the laws under which they are placed and of the ends of being they are bound to fulfill as give solemnity to virtue and restrain them from trifling with life especially when to this is joined the discovery of life and immortality by the gospel the connection in which this life stands with a future eternal state for which we are now under probation in a course of discipline which according as by divine assistance it terminates in our improvement in virtue or through our own misconduct leaves us in a corrupt unimproved state will dismiss us to lasting abodes either of punishment or reward this is far above those faint interrupted hopes those feeble ineffectual reasonings which mere natural light suggests concerning the future condition of mankind here we find what alone can be of any considerable weight with men in practice  direct promise and threatening  an authoritative sanction given to a law  the governor revealed  and the motives addressed to hope and fear urged home on the mind by thus says the lord of hosts nor are circumstances wanting to impress the imagination in the liveliest manner the resurrection of the body the solemnity of a future judgment the decisive sentence the final separation and the everlasting mansions of the good and the bad are all set forth in strong and affecting colors in short a great and magnificent plan of divine administration is in part opened and nothing is omitted that may give mankind the deepest sense of their being all the subjects of the moral government of god  the bounds of this discourse have allowed me to give but an imperfect view of the great principles of religion from these hints however we may recollect so much of the christian doctrine as will be a sufficient foundation for an appeal to every impartial mind whether the knowledge the real and firm belief of these principles of religion be not strictly connected with the improvement of man and thereby of the highest importance to his happiness i reason now with those who admit that to be virtuous and good is real improvement and happiness let them lay what stress they will upon conscience upon its natural authority within and the force and evidence of its dictates obstinate sure they must be who will not grant that the natural tendency of these religious principles is to support the dictates and confirm the authority of conscience to awaken on various occasions the most useful feelings to provide additional restraints from vice and additional motives to every virtue who dares say that there is no case in which conscience stands in real need of such assistance to direct where there is so much uncertainty and darkness and to prompt where there is so much feebleness and irresolution and such a fatal proneness to vice and folly  but how good soever the tendency of religious principles may be their actual significancy and influence on life will still be called in question this tendency is by various causes defeated betwixt the belief of religious principles and correspondent practice it will be said that experience shows there is no necessary connection nor can the propagation of the one at all assure us that proportionable improvements will follow in the other  this is in part allowed as we allow that knowledge and belief admit of various degrees before they arrive at that christian faith which the scripture represents as certainly purifying the heart but though the connection be not necessary betwixt knowledge and practice i hope it will not be denied that some connection there is here there is one avenue to the heart if the tendency of religious knowledge be good wisdom must direct and duty oblige us to cultivate it for tendency will at least in some cases become effectual in more cases probably than are taken notice of amidst the hurry of the world besides the known and distinguished examples of true religion and virtue which in every age of christianity have shone more or less as lights of the world how many may there be in the more silent scenes of life overlooked by superficial observers of mankind on whose hearts and lives religious principles have a great and happy influence even on loose and giddy minds where they are far from operating their full effect their influence is not altogether lost religious principles are at least a clog on vice in its career they stop it from going its full length and though they do not entirely reform the mind are however the means of preserving external order and giving a check to open profligateness and dissolution of manners men that are now bad might probably have been worse without them and the world have suffered more from their licentiousness besides they often sow latent seeds of goodness in the heart which proper circumstances and occasions ripen when the reformation of the offender perhaps is not so conspicuous to the world as his former bad manners have been from the native tendency of religious knowledge there is reason to believe that those good effects of it are not so rare as some would persuade us especially when we consider it as accompanied with a divine blessing by the nature and plain tendency of a thing it is more reasonable to judge of it than to lay the whole stress on observations drawn from a supposed experience which often is narrow in its compass and fallacious in its conclusions one great cause of the tendency of religion being often defeated certainly is that the knowledge of divine things is not thoroughly imbibed nor the belief of them fully received were a just sense and a firm persuasion of them more general amongst men we may rationally hope their good effects would more extensively appear  i admit indeed that mere knowledge will prove unavailing against the power of temper and settled habits these it is said govern the life of men far more than religious belief and will be too hard for all principles whatever perhaps this is said with truth but then we ought to consider that it is the nature of religion to work itself gradually into the affections to acquire the dominion of the temper and so to give rise to habits of acting hence the perfection of religious influence is with great justice and propriety described in scripture by a new heart and a new spirit when the mind is not involuntarily constrained by principle but principle forms the inward constitution and becomes in a manner the same with temper and affection  but the actual influence of principle and belief on mankind admits of further illustration from uncontested matter of fact they who hold the good influence of christian principles to be so inconsiderable as to render the propagation of them of no great importance will be at no loss to give us instances of corrupt and wrong principles having had a great influence on the world loud complaints we hear from this quarter of the direful effects which superstition and enthusiasm have produced how they have poisoned the tempers and transformed the manners of men and have overcome the strongest restraints of law of reason and humanity  is this then the case that all principles except good ones are supposed to be of such mighty energy strange that false religion should do so much and true religion so little  no impartial inquirer sure can be of such an absurd opinion the whole history of mankind shows that religious belief is no inconsiderable principle of action the mischief such belief has done when misled is indeed a good argument to be on our guard against error but as it is a proof of what belief can do it is an argument to hope the more from it when rightly directed the same torrent that overflows and lays waste a country when put out of its natural course enriches the soil when it runs in its proper bed if it be alleged that superstition is the more powerful principle by falling in with the weak and corrupt propensities of mankind it may be opposed to this that truth has the divine blessing and the countenance of heaven on its side let us always hope well of a cause that is good in itself and beneficial to mankind truth is mighty and will prevail let us spread the incorruptible seed as widely as we can and trust in god that he will give the increase so much for the importance of religious knowledge to every individual in the way of improvement let us next consider    what it promises in the way of consolation of aid and relief to man amidst the distresses of life here it must be allowed by all that religion triumphs and its valuable influence in this respect must be a strong argument to every benevolent mind for wishing that influence to be further spread through the world for without religious principle and hope man is a creature miserable and forlorn he finds himself here a stranger in a wide world where the powers and operations of nature are very imperfectly known where both the causes and the issues of things are wrapped up in much darkness where he is quite at a loss or at best can form only an uncertain guess whence he comes for what purpose he was brought unto this state of being and whither he is to go when he departs from hence what a disconsolate situation is this to a serious inquiring mind even though it were in a mans power to fill up the hours of life with perpetual amusement void of care life enjoyed on such terms would upon reflection appear poor and trifling but how much worse when we consider the real condition of man a being frail and feeble beset with various dangers and ills and exposed to many a melancholy reflection when he sees all things around him so transitory and decaying and meets with disappointment and sorrow with vanity and vexation in all the paths of life in this distressed condition to reveal to him such discoveries of god and his administration as the christian religion affords is to reveal to him a father and a friend is to let in a ray of most comforting light upon the darkness of human estate he who was before a destitute orphan wandering in the inhospitable desert has now gained a shelter from the bitter and inclement blast he now knows to whom to pray and in whom to trust where to unbosom his sorrows from what hand to look for relief certain it is that when the heart bleeds from some wound of recent misfortune there is nothing of equal efficacy with religious comfort it is of power to cheer the darkest hours and to assuage the deepest woe by the belief of divine favor and the prospect of happy immortality here the mind expatiates with joy and when bereaved of all its earthly friends solaces itself with the thoughts of one friend that will never forsake it these views have a greater and better effect on the heart of a plain but sincere christian than all the refinements of philosophy have on the learned refined reasonings may please and amuse the mind when it is at ease may perhaps help to relieve it when slightly touched with sorrow but when it is torn with any sore distress they are cold and feeble compared with a direct promise from the word of god this is an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast this has given refuge and strong consolation to many a pious and virtuous soul at a time when mere reasonings would have proved utterly unavailing besides that they can never be so accommodated to the bulk of mankind as to be generally useful this great disadvantage attends them that they raise more perplexities in an inquiring mind than it is in their power to resolve upon the approach of death especially this will be felt when if a man thinks at all his anxiety must naturally increase about the future concerns of his soul then it is that the great importance of the discoveries of the gospel will appear not only life and immortality brought to light but the path opened that leads to life a mediator discovered mercy proclaimed by the governor of the world through this mediator to the frailties and errors of those who are penitent humble and sincere in heart and the presence of their redeemer promised to conduct them through the valley of the shadow of death to unseen habitations of rest and glory where he has prepared their place here is ground for good mens leaving the world with comfort and peace but in this severe and trying period this laboring hour of nature how shall the wretched man support himself who believes not or knows not the hope of religion  secretly conscious to himself that he has not acted the part he ought the failings and vices of his past life arise before him in sad remembrance he wishes to exist after death and yet is afraid of that existence the governor of the world is unknown his mercy for any thing that he can tell may be implored in vain all is mysterious obscurity and in the midst of endless perplexities and doubts the trembling soul is forced away from the body  as the misfortunes of life must have been insupportable to such a man so its end is bitter his setting sun goes down in a dark cloud and the night of death closes over his head full of misery having no hope and being without god that is without the knowledge of god in the world are two things most justly connected by the apostle when he is describing the misery of the heathen nations ephesians ii     thus by means of the knowledge of the lord man considered as an individual is both improved and comforted we are next to show  ii what benefit he receives from this knowledge as a member of society this branch of the subject is in part anticipated by what has been already said for all the improvement that man as an individual receives from religious knowledge redounds to the benefit of the public society reaps the fruits of the virtue of all its members and as each apart is made better the whole must proportionably flourish but besides this religious knowledge has a direct tendency to improve the social intercourses of men and to assist them in cooperating for common good  for first of all it forms them for society it civilizes mankind it tames the fierceness of their passions and wears off the barbarity of their manners without some notions of religion it is much to be questioned whether any regular society ever subsisted or could subsist in the world all those who in early times attempted to reduce wandering and scattered men unto society found it necessary to begin with some institution of religion and the wisest legislators of old through the whole progress of their systems of government treated it as necessary and essential to civil polity if even those imperfect forms of religion mixed with so much error were important to society how much more that reasonable and true worship of god which the gospel teaches true religion introduces the idea of regular subjection by accustoming mankind to the awe of superior power in the deity joined with the esteem of superior wisdom and goodness it is by its natnre an associating principle creating new and sacred bonds of union amongst men common assemblies for religious worship and the joint veneration of one god the sense of being all in common dependent on the same supreme protection and bound by the same ties to duty sharers of the same benefits of religion and expectants of the same reward all this has a tendency to awaken the sense of our friendly relation to knit us together and strengthen our mutual connection  further religious knowledge assists in preparing the way for all useful and ornamental improvements in society it has in fact been found that along with the increase of religious light learning has flourished and useful arts have been cultivated and advanced the true knowledge of the lord promotes a free and manly spirit it teaches men to think for themselves to form their principles upon a a fair inquiry unto the word of god and not to resign their consciences implicitly to men hence it is strongly connected with a detestation of oppression of every kind and forms a taste for liberty and laws we see that tyrannical governments have taken the firmest root in nations blinded by mohammedan and pagan darkness where the throne of violence is supported by ignorance and error in the christian world as long as popish superstition reigned undisturbed darkness oppression and slavery were in its train for some centuries the cloud sat thick and deep over all europe and threatened a relapse unto ancient barbarity till at the auspicious era of the reformation together with the true knowledge of the lord learning liberty and arts began to shine forth and resume their luster at this day the protestant religion is in our own and some other states the great bulwark of liberty the promoters of arbitrary power know this well and hence it has been their constant aim to bear it down and in place of the knowledge of the lord to establish an implicit submission to the dictates of men in matters of religion  but this is not the whole of that happy influence which religious knowledge has on society it is not only subsidiary to its improvement but necessary to its preservation it is the very basis on which it rests for religious principle is what gives mankind the surest hold of one another that last and greatest pledge of veracity an oath without which no society can subsist derives its whole authority from the reverence of god to whom it is a solemn appeal banish religious principle and you loosen all the bonds of society you shake the fundamental pillar of all mutual trust and confidence amongst men nay you destroy the security arising from laws themselves for human laws and human sanctions cannot extend to numberless cases in which the safety of mankind is highly concerned they would be very ineffectual means of maintaining the order and peace of society if there were no checks upon men from the sense of divine legislation if no belief of divine rewards and punishments were to come in aid of what human rewards and punishments so imperfectly provide for  indeed the belief of religion is of such importance to public welfare that the most expressive description we could give of a society in the utmost circumstances of disorder would be to say there was no fear of god left amongst them  our imagination would immediately conceive of them as loose and lawless abandoned to rapine and violence to perfidy and treachery deceiving and deceived oppressing and oppressed consumed by intestine broils and ripe for becoming a prey to the first invader  on the other hand in order to any societys flourishing in its highest perfection and glory we need only suppose the belief of christian principles prevailing in such a degree as to exert their entire influence on the hearts and lives of all its members then would the most amiable scene open we would see the causes of public disunion instantly removed when men were once formed to the pursuit of those higher interests which give no occasion to competitions and jealousies and warmed in heart with that noble spirit of love which our holy religion breathes and of which it has set before us such illustrious examples in almighty god and our blessed redeemer we would see the principles of christian faith shedding over families neighbourhoods and communities the comfortable influences of unity and peace like the dew of hermon and the dew that descends upon the mountains of zion where the lord commands the blessing even life for evermore psalm cxxxiii    we would see them inspiring private faith and public loyalty restoring sobriety of manners and simplicity of life promoting in every man contentment with his lot resignation to divine appointment continual regard to the blessing of heaven  we may extol riches and traffic but in truth the prevalency of such principles of public virtue and concord forms the real strength and glory of a nation in proportion as these prevail they give us the prospect of human society rising from that sad degeneracy into which it is at present sunk and advancing under the blessing of heaven toward that happy period when nation shall not lift up their sword against nation nor war be learned any more isa ii    when there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all the holy mountain of god  to convince us yet further of the importance of religious knowledge to the welfare of society there is one consideration which deserves particular attention it is this that if good seed be not sown in the field tares will infallibly arise there is a strong propension in human nature to religion a natural preparation of the mind for receiving some impressions of religious belief in ignorant and uncultivated minds superstition or enthusiasm never fail to graft themselves upon this root into what monstrous forms these have shot forth and what various mischiefs they have produced in society is too well known but this is not the whole of the danger for designing men are seldom wanting to take advantage of popular weakness and to improve a superstitious biass to their own ambitious and interested ends hence superstition in itself a formidable evil threatens consequences still more formidable when it is made the tool of ambition and interest in this way popery has become the means of enslaving the people and exalting the church to exorbitant power and like some baneful planet has shed most malignant influences both on the civil and religious interests of christian society  as it is the ignorance of true religion which gives rise to those evils this furnishes us with one strong argument for promoting the knowledge of it in the world that just and rational principles of religion may fill up the room in mens minds which superstition will otherwise usurp and the enemies of society will make their advantage of this brings the case nearer to ourselves by suggesting to us the condition of that part of our own country upon which the society for propagating christian knowledge have chiefly bestowed their care a part of the country which may be considered as yet rude and uncivilized where society has scarcely got beyond its infant state and whither the influence of government and order has very imperfectly reached where the inhabitants hitherto accustomed to no subjection except a slavish dependence on their chieftains are inured to rapine totally negligent of the arts of peace and strangers to cultivated life where the grossest ignorance and superstition have remarkably reigned and have nourished as their proper offspring a blind attachment to some pernicious notions of government artfully instilled into their minds if ever the aid of religious knowledge was necessary to establish and assist society it must be allowed to be necessary here especially as we know popish emissaries have not been wanting among them to sow their poisonous principles and to foment that disaffected spirit the violent effects of which were felt a few years ago when we saw them rushing like a torrent from their own bleak mountains to spread confusion and terror through a peaceful land  if so many of our countrymen have hitherto been not only useless but even dangerous to the rest of the society ought not all wise and good men to encourage the design of propagating among them those principles of true religious knowledge which may reform them from barbarity and unite them to the rest of the society regard to our own safety and tranquillity might alone recommend this design though no higher motive were applied to the method that is employed in carrying it on must be allowed to be incontestably proper the establishment of schools for the religious education of youth who must otherwise have been void of all moral culture and of course have been the prepared instruments of violence and cruelty the good designs of the legislature for introducing regular government industry and arts into those parts of the country can never be pursued with success if endeavors be not early used to root out bad principles both of religion and government from their minds and to plant right ones in their stead the more directly to cooperate with the legislature for civil good the society have not confined themselves to the care of religious education but make it their endeavor to banish idleness and to instruct youth in such arts as may qualify them to be useful members of civil society the society are authorized by a second patent obtained from the crown in the year      to cause such of the children as they shall think fit to be instructed and bred up to husbandry trades and manufactures or to such other manual operations as the society shall think proper   these considerations directly respect the good of society but when we take the argument that has been treated in its full extent when we consider the importance of religious knowledge to the improvement and the consolation of every individual to their present happiness and their preparation for future glory the motive for spreading that knowledge through the world receives a great addition of strength is it not an affecting thought that there should be so many of our fellow creatures nay of our countrymen destitute of all those blessings which man may receive from the discoveries of the gospel strangers from the covenant of promise having no hope and without god in the world ephesians ii     what a melancholy view does it give us of human nature to think of so many dark places of the earth that are full of the habitations of cruelty where either sunk in total darkness or enslaved to wild superstition mankind pass their wretched days scarcely raised a degree above the beasts that perish it is noble and generous to engage in a design for retrieving mankind from so much misery for advancing at once their temporal and eternal interests for bringing so many souls into the way of life and acquainting them with him whom to know is life eternal john xvii    such a design calls upon every lover of mankind for encouragement and support as it was undertaken from pious and benevolent views by the society erected for this purpose amongst ourselves so by the progress they have made we have great reason to believe it has been carried on with fidelity and zeal vid the subjoined account of the present state of the society  their concern for the advancement of religion has not been confined to our native country they have sent missionaries among the heathen indians in our american colonies not without success in an undertaking of this nature where the field is so wide and where so much yet remains to be done the charitable assistance of all is most necessary those especially who are rich in this world have here an opportunity put into their hands by providence of employing to the best advantage some of that wealth which they may well spare from the pomp and superfluities of life this will be laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come   tim vi     this will be the means of making the blessings of those who are now ready to perish through lack of knowledge descend at the last upon their heads this will be the ground of joyful and comforting reflections when all the pleasures of life can please no more what a reproach is it to this age of vanity and pleasure that no assistance is denied and no expense is spared to carry on every favorite scheme of diversion and amusement and only pious and publickspirited undertakings are neglected and suffered to languish  i must mention one consideration more which render these associations of good men to promote christian knowledge the more important and the more deserving of our assistance at this day they are not only the means of extending christianity further than it has already reached but likewise of supporting the regard for it at home they preserve at least the face of seriousness amongst us and contribute to recall something of that zeal which has so much decayed this renders them peculiarly seasonable now when a horror at superstition and enthusiasm seems to have made us insensible to the dangers of irreligion and of indifference about all that is sacred though this last is certainly much more the general characteristick of the present times than the former and threatens that dissolution of manners which if it become universal must inevitably carry us with swift steps to ruin as therefore we have any regard for the most valuable public interests let us withstand the torrent of profanity by giving all public testimonies of a just concern for the knowledge and principles of our holy religion let us both give them all the countenance we can at home and embrace every occasion providence gives us of extending their influence further through the world thus whilst we act a part which it is decent and becoming in christians to act we shall enjoy the pleasure of having contributed our endeavors for bringing about that happy revolution foretold by ancient prophecy when in the style of scripture there shall be one lord over all the earth and his name one zech xiv     when his name shall be great from the rising to the setting sun mal i     when there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all his holy mountain  but judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruitful field isaiah xxxii     the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose isaiah xxxv    and the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea  state of the society in scotland for propagating christian knowledge in the year    0 this society took its rise about the year   00 and in the year   0  was erected into a body corporate by letters patent from her late majesty queen anne the intention was to promote the knowledge of christianity through the remote corners of the highlands of scotland miserably sunk in darkness and in ignorance a design which every one must acknowledge laudable and worthy of encouragement  this encouragement it met from many pious and welldisposed persons who from time to time did and do still contribute toward its support by charitable donations in so much that at present the society finds itself in condition to maintain no fewer than     schools at which are educated to the number of  000 children of both sexes  the directors use the word educate because that comes up best to the design of the society which is to instruct the children first of all in the knowledge of christianity the reformed protestant religion   dly in writing orthography arithmetic and church music   dly in the knowledge of the english tongue and if possible to root out the irish altogether and lastly to teach them right principles of government to instill a love of true liberty and affection to king george  with this design did the society set out with this design does it still go on and in this design it has in some measure happily succeeded so that from the beginning of its erection until now at the most moderate computation it has been the means of instructing  0000 children of both sexes in the knowledge of christianity the first step to introduce religion into the heart is to dispel the clouds of ignorance in the head  the society can do no more than men can do they may endeavor to convey knowledge into the head but it is the office of the supreme being to bring it home to the heart  and sure the means which this society uses are of all others the most proper they are applied to the minds of the inhabitants when these minds and these inhabitants are young and their tempers like the willow are more easily bent any way  if they cannot succeed at this age they never will at any and it is believed that if this method of reforming the highlands of scotland proves abortive all other human methods certainly will  sure then it cannot but be the duty and must be the interest of every good man of every briton to encourage this design  tending so evidently to make us a happy  a free  and an united nation  religion and liberty and industry and joy are sisters and never appear to such advantage as in company with one another  while superstition and slavery and idleness and sulleness are specter the most hideous and ought to have their dwelling not upon the earth but under it  the society obtained a new patent in the year      enabling them to instruct the children under their care in the knowledge of husbandry and housewifery trade and manufacture or in such like manual operations this they have already done in several remarkable instances and are desireous to do so in more as their stock enables them and they apply the benefactions made either to the purposes of the first or of the second charter as the donor is pleased to direct so that now religion and industry go hand in hand strengthen and establish one another  among the various instances of generosity which the year      has produced the directors judge themselves bound to take particular notice of the two following both from one country that of ireland the one is the liberality of an irish gentleman of distinction who has not only paid into the society  00 l sterling toward the support of charity schools in the islands of scotland but also caused translate mr baxters call to the unconverted etc into the irish language for the use of such as cannot learn english under direction of this society and has given a very considerable sum and engaged to pay what further may be necessary for defraying the expense of it  the work is now finished by the labors of a reverend member of the church of scotland and will be printed without delay and distributed at the sight of the society  the other is a legacy which the society has received from mr hall surgeon in dublin for no less than  00 l sterling  of which they have now actually got payment  two instances worthy to be imitated by all where circumstances will allow who hope for that melting acknowledgement of the savior of sinners in as much as ye have done those things to one of the least of my brethren ye have done them unto me  besides those endeavors used by the society to promote the knowledge of true religion at home they have also in conformity to a clause in their first patent extended their care to places abroad particularly to the wild and wandering indians on the borders of new york new jersey and pensilvania the first attempt of this kind was made in the year      and another and more successful one in the year      and      of the success of this last mission the world has had a printed account under the care of dr doddridge in mr brainards journal to this the directors beg leave to refer after adding the following extract of the societys latest advices from mr pemberton preses of the society of american correspondents new york april   th      sir enclosed you have the journals of the societys two missionaries who diligently attend their respective charges and the most of those whom we charitably hoped were the subjects of a saving change continue to adorn their profession by a behavior and exemplary conversation  mr brainards indians are daily forming themselves more and more into a civilized and orderly society  the men cultivate their lands the women are learning to spin and they have in a great measure abandoned that slothful course of life which is so natural to all indians that they are brought off from it with the utmost difficulty  we have set up a seminary of learning in new jersey and if the society by recommending our design to pious and charitable persons could procure us any assistance it would doubtless be of extensive service to the interest of religion in these parts etc etc etc     by the two last journals which the society have received from mr brainard it appears among other things that many of the indians are grown extremely desirous of reading and understanding the word of god  for that end says he they attend an evening school which the schoolmaster has set up on purpose  the greater part of the young people attend this school also and some that are  0 or  0 years of age and it is hoped that most of them will in a little time be able to read the bible the school is increasing and the children make good progress in their learning  as to the college proposed to be erected in new jersey the society have done every thing in their power to encourage it and have set apart the sum of  0 l sterling to be employed in buying proper books for the students so that in a little time there is reason to hope that there will be no more reason for a complaint so often made in these parts that the harvest is great but the laborers are few  neither can the directors omit taking this opportunity of recommending this good design to others the thing indeed recommends itself and must do so to every person whose heart is capable of the least tincture of compassion for such vast numbers of poor forlorn indians  nor would such a seminary answer a religious end only it would also serve a political view for sure if from us learning and good manners could be propagated through these savages it would be a mean of engaging them more firmly in the british interest and if along with learning and good manners true religion should take place among them and they become come subjects willing subjects of the king of all kings what joy would not this yield to every sincere christian  by this means streams would break out in that vast wilderness and rivers run in that immense desert  nay the desert would rejoice and blossom as the rose so that from the rising of the sun unto where he goes down a pure offering should be offered unto the true god  men should be blessed in jesus and all nations call him blessed  these are the prayers of this society and they are the prayers of every true christian  names of persons
