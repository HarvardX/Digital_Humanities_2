memoirs of mrs laetitia pilkington wife to the rev mr matthew pilkington  written by herself  wherein are occasionally interspersed all her poems with anecdotes of several eminent persons living and dead among others dean swift alexander pope esquire etc etc etc  dublin printed london reprinted and sold by r griffiths at the dunciad in ludgate street and g woodfall at the kings arms at charing cross       to sir robert king bart sir it is a very great pleasure to me in an age where vice is looked on as a kind of fashionable accomplishment to hear of one young gentleman who is not ashamed of being singularly good who has a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity without any sinister views and who has happily united the fine gentleman to the good christian  these sir are unfading honors these shall embalm and sanctify your name on earth and when this transient scene is past be a sweet and acceptable sacrifice to god  that your virtues may long adorn and bless this world and receive a full and glorious recompense in the next is the ardent prayer of  sir your most obliged and most obedient servant l pilkington  preface it is usual with all authors to write prefaces either to beg the applause of the public or else by way of filling to raise their volumes price a shilling as a most eminent poet is said to have done  i own if the merit of any writer is to be judged by the number of sheets they have written i have very little pretense to favor but as multum in parvo is an expression of an ancient poet i hope my readers will excuse me as i would rather have them rise from table with an appetite than glut them a rule of temperance equally conducive to the health of our minds as of our bodies  i once had the misfortune of writing for a printer who never examined the merit of the work but used to measure it and tell me it would not do at all except i could send him half a dozen yards more of the same stuff and as dr young remarks on large folios well gilt and bound very proper to adorn a library whether the owner of it can read or write or not so tonson turned upholsterer sends home the gilded leather to adorn the room   if i am obliged to send my work in a blue paper covering let them look on the inside which i flatter myself will at least amuse them  as i wrote these memoirs in england the describing particular places or customs peculiar to ireland in order to make the work intelligible to the english readers will i hope be excused for all countries vary from each other in many points  so neither servilely fearing censure nor vainly hoping applause i refer my readers to the ensuing pages  memoirs of mrs pilkington although it has been the common practice with writers of memoirs to fill their volumes with their own praises which whatever pleasure they may have afforded to the authors by indulging their vanity are seldom found to give any to the readers i am determined to quit this beaten track and by a strict adherence to truth please even my greatest enemies by presenting them with a lively picture of all my faults my follies and the misfortunes which have been consequential to them  and i am the more inclined to proceed in that i think the story may be instructive to the female part of my readers to teach them that reputation is the immediate jewel of their souls and that the loss of it will make them poor indeed othello so that i propose myself not as an example but a warning to them that by my fall they may stand the more secure  however numerous my mistakes in life have been they have still had most surprising additions made to them not only by base and unworthy minds wretches devoid of truth and common honesty but also by persons of high rank and such as outwardly profess christianity who have fancied it an act of piety to believe and spread of me the most improbable and notorious falsehoods nay so far has their persecuting zeal been carried that they have rendered my honest industry ineffectual and by depriving me of any means to support life endeavored to make me even such a one as they represented me to be that clergymen and ladies of honor should unite in driving to extremity a person who never yet either in her conversation or writing offended against the laws of decency or humanity is but too apt to make one think they had quite forgotten the christian grace charity without which we are told all other virtues are of no avail and consequently fall far short of perfection themselves  i therefore hope those who have taken such unbounded liberties with my character will also allow me to paint out theirs only with this difference that i shall confine myself to truth a favor i never yet received at their hands since even the priestly robe and mitred head have with regard to me disclaimed it of which in the series of these melancholy adventures i shall be able to produce many surprising instances  i was born in the year      by my mothers side descended of an ancient and honorable family who were frequently intermarried with the nobility my great grandfather was earl of killmallock whose daughter married colonel meade by whom he had twentyone children twelve of whom lived to be married this gentleman to his honor be it spoken though he was a man of fortune and in the army declared on his deathbed that he never had either when a bachelor or a married man criminal conversation with a woman never was drunk never broke his word nor ever used tobacco  the late duke of ormond when lord lieutenant of ireland dining at colonel meades offered to confer on him the honor of knighthood but he then being in an advanced age declined it for himself telling his grace as he was going out of the world and his eldest son coming into it he would choose if he thought proper his grace should bestow it on him which accordingly he did  this gentleman sir john meade was bred to the law and deservedly distinguished as one of the finest orators that ever spoke at the bar he was a perfect master of classical learning and a lover and judge of the muselike arts his paternal estate was about fifteen hundred pounds a year which was augmented by marrying successively two great heiresses as well as by the vast business he had in his profession so that with all those advantages of nature education and fortune it was no wonder he should meet with universal respect and esteem  he was in this situation when sir edward seymor had an estate of five thousand pounds a year left to him in ireland this was a matter too considerable for sir edward to hope immediately to possess without lawsuit or difficulty so that he found his personal appearance absolutely necessary it is to be observed that sir edward seymor was accounted the proudest man in england and sir john meade was as remarkable for the same fault neither indeed did i ever meet with any person of either of those names in england or ireland who was not abundantly stocked with it though without the same pretensions to support it  sir edward seymor landed at dublin filled with that natural contempt for the whole country which those of the english who have not been resident amongst them are but too apt to express on every occasion he there found some of his own countrymen in places of profit and trust of whom he enquired whether there are any such things as good lawyers to be met with in this damned place  they answered yes very good but if he hoped to carry his cause he must see sir john meade well said he let one of my footmen go for him  your footman sir edward said one of the gentlemen who knew sir john why it is odds if he will speak to you i assure you if he does it is a favor few of his clients obtain from him what a duce returned he do irish lawyers take such state upon them you are to consider sir edward he is a gentleman of family has a noble fortune and is so eminent in his profession that should he be employed against you you may bid farewell to your claim  this last argument had such force with sir edward seymor that he condescended to wait on sir john meade next morning sir john had been apprized of what the other had said and resolving to be as stately as himself sent him down word he was very busy but if he pleased to wait till he was at leisure he would see him so sir edward was shown into a parlour where he remained above an hour fretting himself to death at this disrespectful usage offered to a person of his dignity  when sir john thought he had pretty sufficiently mortified him he sent to let him know he should be glad to see him and received him with a politeness natural to him but when sir edward went to open his case to him he told him he must leave him his brief for he could not spare time to hear him so sir edward laid down his brief with a large purse of gold on it and having got his audience of leave departed full of indignation at meeting with a man as proud as himself  when the day appointed for the important trial was come there were numbers of lawyers engaged on either side of the question sir john being i suppose resolved to try his clients patience to the uttermost permitted every one of them to speak before him without interruption and sat drawing birds with a pencil till sir edward was ready to burst with rage at him especially as he found the cause likely to go against him at length when their pleadings were ended and judgment going to be pronounced against sir edward sir john meade arose and desired to be heard which he ever was with favor and attention by the court when making a speech which took an hour and a half in time he so fully confuted all sir edwards antagonists and made his title to the estate so evident and with such powerful eloquence that he had a decree to be put in immediate possession  sir edward was so charmed with sir johns graceful elocution that he could not forbear several times crying out in extacy an angel by heaven an angel but when he found the happy effects of it so much to his own advantage he could no longer contain himself but cathing sir john in his arms my dear dear friend says he permit me to have the honor of calling you so i do not wonder you should be proud who have more cause to be so than any man living  the court not breaking up till it was late sir edward pressed sir john to give him his company that evening sir john excused himself telling him he was every night engaged to a club well then said sir edward if you will give me leave i will accompany you provided you think it will be agreeable to your friends sir john answered they would all he was sure esteem it as a very great honor so accordingly sir edward met them and they were mutually delighted with each others conversation we may presume by their staying together till four the next morning some of sir edwards friends finding him in bed at twelve oclock the ensuing day he told them he had sat up all night with whom sir edward why returned he with homer plato socrates cicero and all the ancient greek and roman poets philosophers and historians  from this time sir edward and sir john contracted a friendship which did not terminate but with their lives  as this little piece of history redounds to the mutual honor of both these great and eminent gentlemen i hope it will not be accounted vanity in me to recite it  one of sir john meades sisters being smitten with the good mien of a roman catholic officer in king jamess army stole a match with him of which my mother was the first fruits but her mother dying in childbed of her second child and king william entirely subduing ireland my grandfather thought proper to follow his royal masters fortune to france leaving my mother then an infant to the wide world however providence did not abandon the helpless orphan her grandmother the widow of colonel meade beforementioned took her home to her and while she lived with true maternal tenderness bestowed on her the best and politest education and when the trustees sat in ireland it being proved she was bred a protestant she recovered her mothers fortune which had been settled on her and which she had been some years kept out of on account of her fathers being a forfeiting person  he in the mean time returned privately to england and married a niece of the celebrated jesuit father hugh peters by this second venture he had one daughter who was married to mr fowler of st thomas in staffordshire the sole heiress of whom is the present lady faulconbridge to whom were it of any use to me i have the honor of being a first cousin by the halfblood  my mother being now in possession of a handsome fortune and by the death of her grandmother entirely at her own disposal for her fathern ever enquired what became of her did not it may be supposed want admirers especially as she had a very graceful person with abundance of wit which was improved by reading and keeping the best company however none of them made any impression on her heart till she saw my father who was the son of a dutch physician that accidentally settled in ireland and who had no other fortune to boast of than a liberal education and a very amiable person and understanding qualities which recommended him to my mother so powerfully that she had constancy enough to wait for him three years while he went to leyden where he studied physic under the late famous dr boerhaave and having taken his degree he returned to ireland uniting himself in marriage to his faithful mistress her friends were at first much displeased with her but my fathers merit soon reconciled them to her choice and there being then but one manmidwife in the kingdom my father made himself master of that useful art and practiced it with great success reputation and humanity  i was their second child and my eldest brother dying an infant for a long time their only one being of a tender weakly constitution i was by my father greatly indulged indeed i cannot say but it was in some measure necessary he should by his gentleness qualify my mothers severity to me otherwise it must have broke my heart for she strictly followed solomons advice in never sparing the rod insomuch that i have frequently been whipped for looking blue of a frosty morning and whether i deserved it or not i was sure of correction every day of my life  from my earliest infancy i had a strong disposition to letters but my eyes being weak after the smallpox i was not permitted to look at a book my mother regarding more the beauty of my face than the improvement of my mind neither was i allowed to learn to read this restraint as it generally happens made me but more earnest in the pursuit of what i imagined must be so delightful twenty times a day have i been corrected for asking what such and such letters spelt my mother used to tell me the word accompanying it with a good box on the ear which i suppose imprinted it on my mind had gulliver seen her behavior i should have imagined he had borrowed a hint from it for his floating island where when a great man had promised any favor the suppliant was obliged to give him a tweak by the nose or a kick on the rump to quicken his memory however i do assure you it had this effect on me insomuch that i never forgot what was once told me and quickly arrived at my desired happiness being able to read before she thought i knew all my letters but this pleasure i was obliged to enjoy by stealth with fear and trembling  i was at this time about five years of age and my mother being one day abroad i had happily laid hold on alexanders feast and found something in it so charming that i read it aloud  but how like a condemned criminal did i look when my father softly opening his studydoor took me in the very fact i dropped my book and burst into tears begging pardon and promising never to do so again but my sorrow was soon dispelled when he bade me not be frightened but read to him which to his great surprise i did very distinctly and without hurting the beauty of the numbers instead of the whipping of which i stood in dread he took me up in his arms and kissed me giving me a whole shilling as a reward and told me he would give me another as soon as i got a poem by heart which he put into my hand and proved to be mr popes sacred eclogue which task i performed before my mother returned home they were both astonished at my memory and from that day forward i was permitted to read as much as i pleased only my father took care to furnish me with the best and politest authors and took delight in explaining to me whatever by reason of my tender years was above my capacity of understanding  but chiefly was i charmed and ravished with the sweets of poetry all my hours were dedicated to the muses and from a reader i quickly became a writer i may truly say with mr pope i lispd in numbers for the numbers came   my performances had the good fortune to be looked on as extraordinary for my years and the greatest and wisest men in the kingdom did not disdain to hear the prattle of the little muse as they called me even in my childish days but as i approached toward womanhood there was a new scene opened to me and by the time i had looked on thirteen years i had almost as many lovers not that i ever was handsome farther than being very fair but i was welldrest sprightly and remarkably welltempered unapt to give or take offense insomuch that my company was generally coveted and no doubt but i should have been happily disposed of in marriage but that my mothers capricious temper made her reject every advantageous proposal offered and at last condemn me to the arms of one of the greatest v  s with reverence to the priesthood be it spoken that ever was wrapped up in crape  and here i cannot forbear observing how very few who wear that s  d h  t are adorned with any real sanctity of manners what ambition avarice lust and cruelty reigns among them they are generally the first seducers of innocence as the holiness of their office gives them free admittance into every family and as soon as they have made a breach in the tender mind for ruins wasteful entrance provided they can but slip their own necks out of the halter and remain unexposed they shall be the first to persecute with ecclesiastical courts and spiritual authority that very person whom they themselves first taught the way to sin let none presume to censure this as spite i suffer for their crimes of whom i write and it is ever allowed that the losers may have leave to speak  i would not by this reflection be thought to strike at religion or the valuable part of the clergy those who are possessed of christian charity and make the sincerity of their faith appear in the righteousness of their life are truly worthy of reverence and honor but alas their number is so few that the ears of corn are scarce discernable among the tares of whom no doubt satan will reap a plentiful harvest  but to return amongst all those who addressed me my heart retained its freedom and if their flattery pleased me it was only as it fed my vanity that passion which like pride is so universal i had no particular engagement was entirely submissive to my parents punctual to all the duties of religion unaffectedly innocent and much more pleased with my female friends than with the company of men  there were two young ladies in particular for whom from my childhood i had a very tender affection and whom as often as i could i visited as their brother was a clergyman many of the gown frequented their house and amongst the rest the reader of our parish church mr p  n he had a good face and many agreeable accomplishments as a tolerable taste in music and a poetical turn which greatly entertained me but being a man of obscure birth and low fortune i had no farther thoughts of him than merely as an acquaintance however it was my misfortune to be liked by him when i least imagined it as he played very well on the organ he gave us an invitation to church promising after eveningprayer to sing an anthem for us i who always delighted in churchmusic begged my mothers permission to go which with some difficulty i obtained after the music he invited us into the vestryroom where he had prepared a little collation of fruit wine etc and singling me out he began to address me in a very passionate style and earnestly begged leave to visit me i told him i was to go into the country next day to stay all the summer and were i not i had no male visitants but such as my parents approved of and consequently it was out of my power to grant his request my mother sending for me prevented any farther conversation for that time and early the next morning we set out on our intended journey  during my stay in the country he wrote me a great many poetical compliments and subscribed himself amyntas as they were really very elegant my mother who always examined my letters expressed great curiosity to know the writer saying i ought to return a letter of thanks to him but as i took this only for a trap i told her which was true i knew not who it was lest i should be denied the pleasure of visiting the young ladies where i first saw him if i should have given her the smallest hint that i guessed at the person  i had by this time a brother of about nine years of age of whom my father and mother were fond even to extravagance whenever i went abroad he used to cry to go with me and was constantly indulged in it  a few days after our return to town i went to wait on the young ladies beforementioned and took my brother with me i was scarce seated when mr p  n came in and after saluting me began to reproach me with cruelty in never having favored him with an answer to any of his letters i told him i was much obliged to him for the agreeable entertainment they had afforded me but that excepting my father i had never wrote to any man neither was i mistress of wit enough to correspond with him a good many civil things were said on either hand during tea time after which my brother growing urgent with me to return home i happened to say he was so great a favorite i durst not contradict him upon which mr p  n made his application to him and gave him an invitation to his lodgings where he entertained him so kindly that the child returned in raptures with him and laden with toys and sweetmeats upon this civility to my brother my father sent and invited mr p  n to dinner and you may be sure he did not refuse him but quickly found the art of making himself so agreeable to my parents that they were even uneasy whenever he was absent which seldom happened except when his duty required his attendance he now began openly to court me and to my great surprise neither of them feemod averse to it but allowed him as much liberty of conversing with me as a reasonable man could desire and for my own part he gained so large a share in my esteem that as they seemed to approve of him i was very well satisfied  one year past on in this manner during which time mr p  n never omitted any thing to convince me of the sincerity of his passion and though he saw me every day and all the day yet every day was still but as the first so eager was he still to see me more   the ensuing spring my mother took a lodging about a mile from dublin by the seaside for the benefit of bathing where my father and mr p  n came every afternoon together to visit us but my fathers business seldom permitting him to stay above half an hour he generally left mr p  n with us who one night happening to stay later than ordinary left a gold watch and a handsome diamond ring in my possession lest as he said he should be robbed of them going home my father and he coming to us the next day according to custom i brought to mr p  n his ring and watch but he would by no means accept of either but insisted on my keeping them as a present my father and mother were both by and neither of them showing any dislike to it i was with great reluctance obliged by him to take them  i mention these particulars trifling as they are because i have been accused of disobedience to my parents in marrying without their consent or knowledge whereas they were acquainted with the affair from beginning to end neither was i any more than passive in it never having allowed myself to have any will but theirs  my father was at this time so eminent in his profession and lived after so elegant a manner that every body concluded he was able to give me a very good fortune and few people could believe he countenanced mr p  ns addresses to me he neither having any preferment in the church nor any other fortune and whatever merit an irish clergyman may possess he has little hope of advancement by it unless he has some relation in the house of commons who by betraying the interest of his country can procure for him the leavings of a church distressed a hungry vicarage at best or some remote inferior post with forty pounds a year at most swift and in this the present state of poor ireland nearly resembles that of england under the reign of queen mary when as soon as a bishopric became vacant an italian was immediately nominated to it ireland groans under the same calamity an english v  y english judges english bishops with their long train of relations and dependants lay their hard hands on all preferments while her learned sons languish out life in hopeless poverty and dejection of spirit  i have frequently observed it as a want of policy in the english government to permit the people of ireland to have an university learning naturally inspires men with the love of liberty the principles of which ought to be discouraged in the minds of those whom their masters are pleased to condemn to slavery want and oppression unless perhaps it may be done with a cruel intent of making their yoke the more galling to them  ireland while free was remarkable for producing brave and valiant men ever witness for her her matchless sons whose valor still remains on french records for twenty long campaigns yet from an empress now a captive grown she saved britannias right and lost her own swift  i hope i shall be pardoned by all true patriots for this digression if not i can only make use of falstaffs apology that rebellion lay in my way and i found it  but to resume my thread all my friends and relations attacked my father warmly on this head who solemnly declared he knew nothing of any amorous correspondence between mr p  n and his daughter that the gentleman came to visit us as being parishioners but withal declared since such a report was spread he would civilly forbid him the house which accordingly he ordered my mother to do mr p  n came as usual and my mother delivered her dreadful commission to him no sooner was the fatal sentence pronounced but my astonished lover fell pale and speechless to the floor and to say the truth my case was little better than his i raised him in my arms and senseless as he seemed he grasped me close and leaned his drooping head upon my bosom whilst my mother applied remedies to him till he revived when he came to himself he blamed us for our care saying since i was lost he could not would not live  as i was naturally of a soft compassionate temper the condition i saw him in pierced my very soul but i was too much in awe of my mother to venture to say so at that time so he left me with sorrow deeply imprinted in his countenance and as i believed in his heart  about two years before this a young woman of about eighteen years of age was brought to my father by a stationer to be by him instructed in midwifery she was mistress of hebrew greek latin and french understood the mathematics as well as most men and what made these extraordinary talents yet more surprising was that her parents were poor illiterate country people so that her learning appeared like the gift poured out on the apostles of speaking all languages without the pains of study or like the intuitive knowledge of angels yet in as much as the power of miracles is ceased we must allow she used human means for such great and excellent acquirements and yet in a long friendship and familiarity with her i could never obtain a satisfactory account from her on this head only she said she had received some little instruction from the minister of the parish when she could spare time from her needlework to which she was closely kept by her mother she wrote elegantly both in verse and prose and some of the most delightful hours i ever past were in the conversation of this female philosopher  my father readily consented to accept of her as a pupil and gave her a general invitation to his table so that she and i were seldom asunder my parents were well pleased with our intimacy as her piety was not inferior to her learning whether it was owing to her own desire or the envy of those who survived her i know not but of her various and beautiful writings except one poem of here is in mrs barbers works i have never seen any published it is true as her turn was chiefly to philosophical or divine subjects they might not be agreeable to the present taste yet could her heavenly muse descend from its sublime height to the easy epistolary style and suit itself to my then gay disposition as may appear by the two following poems to make them intelligible my reader must observe that i being in a country town at the assizes time had writ her an account to dublin of the principal entertainments i met with there and in the rest of the country i must also beg pardon for publishing the compliments paid to me in them which i really would omit were it possible her answer to my first letter was this to miss laetitia van lewen the fleeting birds may soon in ocean swim and northern whales through liquid azure skim the dublin ladies their intrigues forsake to dress and scandal an aversion take when you can in the lonely forest walk and with some serious matron gravely talk of possets poultices and waters stilled and monstrous casks with mead and cider filled how many hives of bees she has in store and how much fruit her trees this summer bore or home returning in the yard can stand and feed the chickens from your bounteous hand of each ones topknot tell and hatching pry like tully waiting for an augury when night approaches down to table sit with a great crowd choice meat and little wit what horse won the last race how mighty tray at the last famous hunting caught the prey surely you cannot but such discourse despise methinks i see displeasure in your eyes o my laetitia stay no longer there you will soon forget that you yourself are fair why will you keep from us from all that is gay there in a lonely solitude to stay where not a mortal through the year you view but bobwiggd hunters who their game pursue with so much ardor they would a cock or hare to thee in all thy blooming charms prefer you write of belles and beaux that there appear and gilded coaches such as glitter here for gilded coaches each estated clown that gravely slumbers on the bench has one but beaux they are young attorneys sure you mean who thus appear to your romantic brain alas no mortal there can talk to you that love or wit or softness ever knew all they can speak ofs capias and law and writs to keep the country fools in awe and if to wit or courtship they pretend it is the same way that they a cause defend in which they give of lungs a vast expense but little passion thought or eloquence bad as they are they will soon abandon you and gain and clamor in the town pursue so haste to town if even such fools you prize o haste to town and bless the longing eyes of your constantia    the second was as follows if my laetitia still persists to love the country village and the shady grove the murmuring rivlet and the turtles moan despising all the grandeur of a town where beauty triumphs and where pleasure reigns and rounds of mirth relieve our daily pains where georges mighty substitute appears and every face with blooming pleasure chears grafton whom never fair one saw unmoved whom even great churchills beauteous offspring loved for him whatever over all our kingdoms fine they in this happy place together join with him each warlike glittering soldier goes with him the tender race of whining beaux in short we have here all that may hope tengage one of your wit your beauty and your age if all these powerful arguments should fail i will in the tenderest part your heart assail the lovely damon languishes and dies nor can revive but by your charming eyes but i forgot  mamma these lines must see so you shall hear no more of him from me   as this lady was perfectly well acquainted with mr p  ns regard for me he applied to her to entreat a meeting at her lodgings where i frequently went  she had too much compassion for a despairing honorable lover to refuse his request and accordingly she gave him notice the next visit that i made to her after having asked my consent to it our interview was very melancholy and his sighs and tears prevailed so much on my young soft heart that at last i faithfully promised to be his but added we were both so young that it would be prudent to wait till he had some preferment or till my parents came into better temper and that in the mean time i would see him or write to him as often as i conveniently could  i forgot to mention that i had sent him his watch and ring some days before he would fain have prevailed on me to take them again but i absolutely refused them  the next morning my father told me i must prepare to go and stay a year with my grandfather who lived a hundred miles distant from dublin and that i must set out in two days i made no answer but thought proper to give mr p  n notice of my departure and easily prevailed on my brother to give him a letter but heavens how was i frighted when he returning in a few moments told me mr p  n had stabbed himself with his penknife i ran all in tears to my mother entreating her permission to go and see him she appeared much concerned and sent for him to come to us which pleasing summons he readily obeyed but i could scarce forbear laughing at my own credulity when my wounded swain came to us in perfect health he had indeed given himself a scratch on purpose to terrify us and had just such a desperate wound as i have frequently received from the point of a pin without complaining  however by this artifice he once more gained admission to us and had an opportunity of assuring my mother that if she sent me to the west indies he would follow me and added also that he was next heir to a good estate which was the most prevailing argument he could make use of to her and took such an effect that she not only kept him to supper but so far indulged him as to give him a key to the garden which opened into a little stable lane by which means he could come in and go out as often as he pleased unnoticed as soon as he left us my mother spoke to me in this manner child said she i believe that young man loves you sincerely neither have your father or i any objection to him but in the light we appear in to the world it would seem strange to accept of him as a sonin law your father is not at present able to give you a fortune and i know most of those who address you hope for one with you and he chooses rather to reject them than let them into his real circumstances what i would therefore advise you to is this if you love this man marry him we shall at first seem displeased and then forgive it and do for you every thing within our power as he is an ingenious sober man your fathers interest may soon get him a living and till then ye shall both live with us  this discourse strangely surprised me and left me doubtful how to act to take to myself the reproach of disobedience in the eyes of the world appeared very shocking to me and though i was resolved to marry mr p  n some time or other yet i was startled at the thought of doing it immediately and told my mother my objections however they appeared but trifling to her the next morning she called me pretty early to breakfast and to my great surprise i found mr p  n with my father his harpsichord placed in the parlour which with a cat and an owl were all his worldly goods  he told me with great rapture that he was going for a ring and a license to be married in the evening as for my part i thought he only jested till my father confirmed it by telling me i must either resolve to marry immediately or break off with mr p  n entirely leaving it to my choice which to do i was too much confounded to make any other return than to give my hand to mr p  n who kissed it with great extacy and my unfortunate nuptials being thus concluded we were married privately in the evening by the vicar general having no other witnesses but my father and mother and his father and we resolved to keep it secret for a few days to avoid the hurry and expense of matrimony we went into the country to my uncle brigadier meades seat for a fortnight where my new espoused husband staying from me a whole day in pursuit of his game for he delighted in fowling at his return i presented him with the following lines my first attempt in poetry that was not quite childish the petition of the birds ah shepherd gentle shepherd spare us plumed inhabitants of air that hop and inoffensive rove from tree to tree from grove to grove what phrenzy has possessed your mind to be destructive of your kind admire not if we kindred claim our separate natures are the same to each of us thou owst a part to grace thy person head or heart the chaste the fond the tender dove inspires thy breast with purest love the towering eagle claims a part in thy courageous generous heart on thee the finch bestowed a voice to bid the raptured soul rejoice the hawk has given thee eyes so bright they kindle love and soft delight thy snowy hue and graceful mien may in the stately swan be seen the robins plumes afford the red which thy soft lips and cheeks bespread thy filial piety and truth the stork bestowed to crown thy youth did we these several gifts bestow to give perfection to a foe did we so many virtues give to thee too fierce to let us live suspend your rage and every grove shall echo songs of grateful love let pity sooth and sway your mind and be the phoenix of mankind   this little poetical essay met with more applause than it really merited on account of my youth and was extremely acceptable to mr p  n who with the raptures of an enamoured bridegroom read it to every person whom he thought possessed of taste or genius  on our return to town we received the visits and compliments of all our acquaintance every one of whom my mother assured i had married without their consent but this was not all for she said it so often that at length she persuaded herself it was so and made it a pretense for giving me all imaginable ill treatment both in public and private which having no remedy i was obliged to bear as patiently as i could for if i quitted her house i had no place to go to as mr p  ns whole income would scarce have paid the rent of a tolerable ready furnished lodging however i had some consolation in mr p  ns tenderness which seemed daily to increase for me and in the conversation of a very agreeable set of friends some of whom it may not be amiss to give a particular description of  in the first place i had the honor of being well received by mrs percival who is married to the brother of the earl of egmont to whose virtues i cannot refuse doing justice although her censures of me have not been overcharitable a lady of most universal genius there being no one accomplishment that adorns the woman of quality but what she possessed and her station gave her an opportunity of showing them to advantage she was also extremely happy in her family her husband was a most worthy gentleman both her sons men of sense and honor and one of her daughters very agreeable it may easily be supposed this belle assembly engaged the company of all the learned and polite world every night was a drawing room and the ingenious and curious of both sexes went home delighted and improved as my father was physician to mrs percival and her eldest son married to a near relation of mine i had at all times free access and so found a frequent pleasing relief from my vexations  i had also the much envied honor of being known to dr swift whose genius excellent as it was surpassed not his humanity in the most judicious and useful charities although often hid under a rough appearance till he was perfectly convinced both of the honesty and distress of those he bestowed it on he was a perpetual friend to merit and learning and utterly incapable of envy indeed why should he not who in true genuine wit could fear no rival  yet as i have frequently observed in life that where great talents are bestowed there the strongest passions are likewise given this truly great man did but too often let them have dominion over him and that on the most trifling occasions during mealtimes he was evermore in a storm the meat was always too much or too little done or the servants had offended in some point imperceptible to the rest of the company however when the cloth was taken away he made his guests rich amends for the pain he had given them by the former part of his behavior for then was truly mingled in the friendly bowl the feast of reason and the flow of soul pope yet strict temperance preserved for the doctor never drank above half a pint of wine in every glass of which he mixed water and sugar yet if he liked his company would sit many hours over it unlocking all the springs of policy learning true humor and inimitable wit  it is a very great loss to the world that this admirable gentleman never could be prevailed on to give us the particulars of his own life because as it is the fate of all eminent persons to have various characters given of them so it was more remarkably his one reason for this may justly be assigned that as at his first setting out party ran high those who on either side had any talents for writing spared not to throw the blackest aspersions on the other so that if we give them both credit we must conclude there was neither honor nor virtue among them but that all who were out tories and whigs whigs and tories were equally corrupt indeed ambition is a grand deceiver and apt to undermine integrity itself and this the doctor himself was so sensible of that i have frequently heard him declare he thought it a great blessing that all his hopes of preferment were at once cut off insomuch that he had nothing to tempt or mislead him from a patriotism in which his grateful country found their happiness and security  this leads me to a story i remember to have heard him tell and therefore i hope cannot be impertinent  a clergyman whose character greatly resembled that i have heard bishop berkley give to bishop atterbury namely a most learned fine gentleman who under the softest and politest appearance concealed the most turbulent ambition this clergyman having made his merit as a preacher too eminent to be overlooked had it early rewarded with a mitre his friend dr swift went to congratulate him on it but at the same time told him he hoped as his lordship was a native of ireland and had now a seat in the house of peers he would employ his powerful elocution in the service of his distressed country the prelate told him the bishopric was but a very small one and he could not hope for a better if he did not oblige the court very well says swift then it is to be hoped when you have a better you will become an honest man ay that i will mr dean says he till then my lord farewell this pious prelate was twice translated to richer sees and on every translation dr swift waited on him to remind him of his promise but to no purpose there was now an archbishopric in view and till that was obtained nothing could be done this in a short time he likewise possessed he then sent for the dean and told him i am now at the top of my preferment for i well know no irishman will ever be made primate therefore as i can rise no higher in fortune or station i will zealously promote the good of my country a fine reason truly and so he commenced a most outrageous patriot from those very laudable motives and continued so till his death which happened within these few years  i hope my readers will indulge me in the frequent mention i shall make of dr swift for though his works are universally esteemed yet few persons now living have had so many opportunities of seeing him in private life as my being a person sans consequence afforded me which happiness i obtained by the following means  the learned nymph beforementioned whom curiosity engaged every person to see had shown many of my scribbles to dr delany known sufficiently by his own incomparable life and writings as she was one of the first to congratulate me on my marriage she was a witness how severely both mr p  n and i were used or rather abused by my mother she told dr delany of it and made such favorable mention of the poor young couple that he generously imagined his countenancing mr p  n might be a means of procuring us better treatment he had been classfellow with my father in the college and though they did not visit yet they had that mutual esteem for each other which good men feel for good men and were pleased whenever accident threw them into each others company the doctor preaching at our parish church immediately after our marriage was so kind as to join us coming out and accompany us home to wish the young couple joy a favor we were all extremely proud of at parting he gave us all an invitation to to dine at his beautiful villa about a small mile distant from dublin what opinion i conceived of him and his improvements may be seen in the following lines composed in one of his lovely arbours  delville the seat of the rev dr delany hail happy delville blissful seat the muses best beloved retreat with prospects large and unconfined blessed emblem of their masters mind where fragrant gardens painted meads wide opening walks and twilight shades inspiring scenes elate the heart nature improved and raised by art so paradise delightful smiled blooming and beautifully wild thrice happy sage who safe retired by heaven and by the muse inspired in polished arts or lays sublime or godlike acts employ your time here natures beauties you explore and searching her mysterious store through all her operations find the image of the sovereign mind and in each insect plant and flower contemplate the creating power nor is thy love of him alone in fruitless speculation shown through life you happily exert the christian virtues of your heart to give new schemes of culture birth and bless and beautify the earth to raise the afflicted from despair and make the friendless wretch thy care to thee the highest bliss is given a soul to praise and copy heaven   whether it was owing to my youth or any real merit in the verses i know not but weak as they were from the candor of the company they met with great applause and the worthy gentleman to whom they were directed praised the poetry extremely only modestly wished i had a better subject to employ my fine genius as he was pleased to call it  i hope if i should live to publish these writings none of the honorable persons mentioned in them as having been once my friends will be offended at it since whatever misfortunes have since befallen me i was not then quite unworthy of the regard they showed me and still retain a grateful sense of their favor only lamenting that by one fatal folly it is irrecoverably lost  and now i must confess as i have talked of ambition i had a strong one to be known to dr swift as dr delany had recommended and introduced mr p  n to him and the learned lady beforementioned i thought it a little hard to be excluded from the delight and instruction i might possibly receive from such conversation and having often remonstrated on this head to no purpose i at last told them for to give me my due i was pretty pert that truly they were envious and would not let me see the dean knowing how much i surpassed them all as i spoke this but half serious i set them all a laughing and as they were to meet the next day at the deaneryhouse to keep the anniversary of his birthday i enclosed to dr delany the following lines to the rev dr swift on his birthday while i the godlike men of old in admiration wrapped behold revered antiquity explore and turn the longlived volumes over where cato plutarch flaccus shine in every excellence divine i grieve that our degenerate days produce no mighty souls like these patriot philosopher and bard are names unknown and seldom heard spare your reflection phoebus cries it is as ungrateful as unwise can you complain this sacred day that virtues or that arts decay behold in swift revived appears the virtues of unnumberd years behold in him with new delight the patriot bard and sage unite and know ierne in that name shall rival greece and rome in fame   dr delany presented these lines to the dean and at the same time told him my saucy speech abovementioned the dean kindly accepted of my compliment and said he would see me whenever i pleased a most welcome message to me  a few days after the dean sent the doctor word he would dine with him at delville and desired to meet mr and mrs p  n there you may be assured i obeyed this welcome summons and a gentlewoman was so kind as to call on me to go with her when we arrived dr delanys servant told us his master the dean and mr p  n were walking in the garden we met them on a noble terrass whose summit was crowned with a magnificent portico where painting and sculpture displayed their utmost charms the lady presented me to the dean who saluted me and surprised me by asking her if i was her daughter she smiled and said i was mrs p  n what says he this poor little child married god help her she is early engaged in trouble we passed the day in a most elegant and delightful manner and the dean engaging mr p  n to preach for him at the cathedral the sunday following gave me also with the rest of the company an invitation to dinner as the communion is administered every sunday in this antique church dedicated to st patrick the first prelate who taught the gospel in ireland i was charmed to see with what a becoming piety the dean performed that solemn service which he had so much at heart that he wanted not the assistance of the liturgy but went quite through it without ever looking in the prayer book indeed another part of his behavior on this occasion was censured by some as savouring of popery which was that he bowed to the holytable however this circumstance may vindicate him from the wicked aspersion of being deemed an unbeliever since it is plain he had the utmost reverence for the eucharist service being over we met the dean at the churchdoor surrounded by a crowd of poor to all of whom he gave charity excepting one old woman who held out a very dirty hand to him he told her very gravely that though she was a beggar water was not so scarce but she might have washed her hands and so we marched with the silver verge before us to the deaneryhouse when we came into the parlour the dean kindly saluted me and without allowing me time to sit down bade me come and see his study mr p  n was for following us but the dean told him merrily he did not desire his company and so he ventured to trust me with him into the library well says he i have brought you here to show you all the money i got when i was in the ministry but do not steal any of it i will not indeed sir says i so he opened a cabinet and showed me a whole parcel of empty drawers bless me say he the money is flown he then opened his bureau wherein he had a great number of curious trinkets of various kinds some of which he told me were presented to him by the earl and countess of oxford some by lady masham and some by lady betty germain at last coming to a drawer filled with medals he bade me choose two for myself but he could not help smiling when i began to poize them in my hands choosing them by weight rather than antiquity of which indeed i was not then a judge  the dean amused me in this manner till we were summoned to dinner where his behavior was so humorous that i cannot avoid relating some part of it he placed himself at the head of his table opposite to a great pierglass under which was a marble sideboard so that he could see in the glass whatever the servants did at it he was served entirely in plate and with great elegance but the beef being overroasted put us all in confusion the dean called for the cookmaid and ordered her to take it down stairs and do it less the maid answered very innocently that she could not why what sort of a creature are you says he to commit a fault which cannot be amended and turning to me he said very gravely that he hoped as the cook was a woman of genius he should by this manner of arguing be able in about a years time to convince her she had better send up the meat too little than too much done charging the men servants whenever they imagined the meat was ready they should take it spit and all and bring it up by force promising to aid them in case the cook resisted the dean then turning his eye on the lookingglass espied the butler opening a bottle of ale and helping himself to the first glass he very kindly jumbled the rest together that his master and guests might all fare alike ha friend says the dean sharps the word i find you drank my ale for which i stop two shillings of your boardwages this week for i scorn to be outdone in any thing even in cheating dinner at last was over to my great joy for now i had hope of a more agreeable entertainment than what the squabbling with the servants had afforded us  the dean thanked mr p  n for his sermon i never says he preached but twice in my life and then they were not sermons but pamphlets i asked him what might be the subject of them he told me they were against woods halfpence pray madam says he do you smoke no indeed sir says i nor your husband neither sir it is a sign said he you were neither of you bred in the university of oxford for drinking and smoking are the first rudiments of learning taught there and in those two arts no university in europe can outdo them pray mrs p  n tell me your faults indeed sir i must beg to be excused for if i can help it you shall never find them out no says he then mr p  n shall tell me i will sir says he when i have discovered them pray mr dean says dr delany why will you be so unpolite as to suppose mrs p  n has any faults why i will tell you replied the dean whenever i see a number of agreeable qualities in any person i am always sure they have bad ones sufficient to poize the scale i bowed and told the dean he did me great honor and in this i copied bishop berkley whom i have frequently heard declare that when any speech was made to him which might be construed either into a compliment or an affront or that to make use of his own word had two handles he was so meek and so mild that he always took hold of the best  the dean then asked me if i was a queen what i should choose to have after dinner i answered his conversation phooh says he i mean what regale a dish of coffee sir why then i will so far make you as happy as a queen you shall have some in perfection for when i was chaplain to the earl of berkley who was in the government here i was so poor i was obliged to keep a coffeehouse and all the nobility resorted to it to talk treason i could not help smiling at this oddity but i really had such an awe on me that i could not venture to ask him as i longed to do what it meant the bottle and glasses being taken away the dean set about making the coffee but the fire scorching his hand he called to me to reach him his glove and changing the coffeepot to his left hand held out his right one ordered me to put the glove on it which accordingly i did when taking up part of his gown to fan himself with and acting in character of a prudish lady he said well i do not know what to think women may be honest that do such things but for my part i never could bear to touch any mans flesh  except my husbands whom perhaps says he she wished at the devil  mr p  n says he you would not tell me your wifes faults but i have found her out to be a d  ned insolent proud unmannerly slut i looked confounded not knowing what offense i had committed  says mr p  n ay sir i must confess she is a little saucy to me sometimes but  what has she done now done why nothing but sat there quietly and never once offered to interrupt me in making the coffee whereas had i had a lady of modern good breeding here she would have struggled with me for the coffeepot till she had made me scald myself and her and made me throw the coffee in the fire or perhaps at her head rather than permit me to take so much trouble for her  this raised my spirits and as i found the dean always prefaced a compliment with an affront i never afterward was startled at the latter as too many have been not entering into his peculiarly ironical strain but was modestly contented with the former which was more than i deserved and which the surprise rendered doubly pleasing  by this time the bell rang for church and dr delany and mr p  n who with myself were now all the company for the rest departed before the coffee was out were obliged to attend the summons but as there is no service in the cathedral but eveningprayer at six oclock i chose rather to attend the dean there than go to hear another sermon by this means i had him all to myself for near three hours during which time he made me read to him the annals of the four last years of the reign of queen anne written by himself the intentions of which seemed to be a vindication of the then ministry and himself from having any design of placing the pretender on the throne of great britain it began with a solemn adjuration that all the facts therein contained were truth and then proceeded in the manner of lord clarendon with giving the particular characters of every person whom he should have occasion to mention amongst whom i remember he compared lord bollingbroke to petronius one who agreeably mingled business with pleasure at the conclusion of every period he demanded of me whether i understood it for i would says he have it intelligent to the meanest capacity and if you compreprehend it it is possible every body may i bowed and assured him i did and indeed it was written with such perspecuity and elegance of style that i must have had no capacity at all if i did not taste what was so exquisitely beautiful  mr p  n when he was chaplain to alderman barber in the year of his mayoralty mentioned those annals to mr pope who said he had dissuaded the dean from publishing them as the facts contained in them were notoriously false i was greatly astonished when mr p  n told me this nor could i tell what to determine it seemed strange to me that a person of the deans good sense and veracity should in the most solemn manner invocate the almighty to bear testimony to falsehoods publicly known to be such and yet as mr pope was in prose a man of unquestioned probity and united to the dean in the strictest bonds of friendship and consequently without doubt well acquainted with the transactions of those times we can hardly suppose he would speak in the manner he did without just grounds for so doing and his evidence seems strengthened by his being of the romish religion which must certainly incline him to wish well to a prince of the same faith however upon the whole i am inclined to judge charitably of the dean and to believe that though the ministers frequently employed him as a writer and entertained him as a companion yet they had not let him into the depth of their designs the mystery of iniquity so that what he relates in his annals of the inviolable attachment of those in power to the hanover succession and the protestant faith might be by him believed to be truth for who so wise but may be deceived and perhaps mr popes long and intimate correspondence with lord bollingbroke gave him a better knowledge of what was really intended at that critical juncture pardon this digression  the bell rang for eveningprayer to which i accompanied the dean there is a fine organ in this church which with its antique magnificence and so harmonious a choir brought miltons lines into my mind and let my due feet never fail to walk the studious cloisters pale and love the high embowed roof with antique pillars massy proof and storyd windows richly dight shedding a dim religious light there let the pealing organ blow to the fullvoicd choir below in service high and anthem clear which may with pleasure through mine ear dissolve me into ecstasies and bring all heaven before my eyes   on our return to the deaneryhouse we found there waiting our coming dr delany and mr rochford to whose wife a letter of advice to a newmarried lady published since in the deans works was written and which by the bye the lady did not take as a compliment either to her or the sex mr p  n dr sheridan author of the art of punning with two or three other clergymen who usually passed sunday evening with the dean mr p  n and i were for going home but the dean told us he gave us leave to stay to supper which from him was a sufficient invitation the dean then pulled out of his pocket a little gold runlet in which was a bottlescrew and opening a bottle of wine he decanted it off the last glass being muddy he called to mr p  n to drink it for says he i always keep some poor parson to drink the foul wine for me mr p  n entering into his humor thanked him and told him he did not know the difference but was glad to get a glass at any rate why then says the dean you shall not for i will drink it myself why p  x take you you are wiser than a paultry curate whom i asked to dine with me a few days ago for upon my making the same speech to him he told me he did not understand such usage and so walked off without his dinner by the same token i told the gentleman who recommended him to me that the fellow was a blockhead and i had done with him  the dean then missing his golden bottlescrew told me very sternly he was sure i had stolen it i affirmed very seriously i had not upon which he looked for it and found it where he himself had laid it tis well for you says he that i have got it or i would have charged you with theft why pray sir should i be suspected more than any other person in the company for a very good reason says he because you are the poorest  there now came in to sup with the dean one of the oddest little mortals i ever met with he formerly wrote the gazetteer and upon the strength of being an author and of having traveled took upon him not only to dictate to the company but to contradict whatever any other person advanced right or wrong till he had entirely silenced them all and then having the whole talk to himself for to my great surprise the dean neither interrupted nor showed any dislike of him he told us a whole string of improbabilities such as that each pillar of st peters at rome took up more ground than a convent which was near it wherein were twelve monks with their chapel garden and infirmary by this account every pillar must take up at least half an acre and considering the number of them we must conclude the edifice to be some miles in circumference no one present had ever been at rome except himself so that he might tell us just what he thought proper  i took notice that before this dogmatical gentleman the dean was most remarkably complaisant to mr p  n and me and at our going away the dean would hand me down all the steps to the coach thanking us for the honor of our company at the same time sliding into my hand as much money as mr p  n and i had given at the offering in the morning and coachhire also which i durst not refuse lest i should have been deemed as great a blockhead as the parson who refused the thick wine  it has been a matter of dispute amongst the learned whether england or ireland had the honor of giving to the world this admirable person it is probable posterity may contend this point as warmly as the seven cities of greece did the birthplace of homer and though in reality it is of no great importance where a man is born yet as the irish are the eternal ridicule of the english for their ignorance i am proud hibernia had the happiness of producing this brilliant wit to redeem the credit of the country and to convince the world a man may draw his first breath there and yet be learned wise generous religious witty social and polite  the account i have frequently heard the dean give of himself was that he was born in hoeysalley in warburghs parish dublin his father was a lawyer and returning from the circuit he unfortunately brought home the itch with him which he had got by lying in some foul bed on the road somebody advised him to use mercury to cure it which prescription cost him his life in a very few days after his return the dean was a posthumous son to this gentleman but as he said came time enough to save his mothers credit he was given to an irish woman to nurse whose husband being in england and writing to her to come to him as she could not bear the thoughts of parting with the child she very fairly took him with her unknown to his mother or any of his relations who could learn no tidings either of him or her for three years at the end of which time she returned to ireland and restored the child to his mother from whom she easily obtained a pardon both on account of the joy she conceived at seeing her only son again when she had in a manner lost all hope of it as also that it was plain the nurse had no other motive for stealing him but pure affection which the women of iland generally have in as eminent degree for the children they nurse as for their own offspring  i believe the deans early youth did not promise that bright day of wit which has since enlightened the learned world whilst he was at the university of dublin he was so far from being distinguished for any superiority of parts or learning that he was stopped of his degree as a dunce when i heard the dean relate this circumstance for i set down nothing but what i had from his own mouth i told him i supposed he had been idle but he affirmed to the contrary assuring me he was really dull which if true is very surprising  i have often been led to look on the world as a garden and the human minds as so many plants set by the hand of the great creator for utility and ornament thus some we see early produce beautiful blossoms and as soon fade away others whose gems are more slow in unfolding but more permanent when blown and others again who though longer in arriving at perfection not only bless us then with shade and odor but also with delicious wholesome fruit to go on with the allegory we often hear from children very bright sallies of wit and reflections above their years from these hopeful beginnings we are apt to expect something very extraordinary in their maturity but how often are we disappointed how often do we see these sparkling children dwindle gradually into the most humdrum men and women as if to make use of the florists phrase the blow was quite over and some whose childhood has given no presages of great talents have improved every year till they have brought forth the beautiful flowers of poetry and rhetoric and the rich fruits of wisdom and virtue  whether this comparison will hold i submit to the judgment of those who are better acquainted with the secret workings of nature than i can presume to be i am afraid of going out of my depth and yet i have a great inclination to say a little more on this subject  i have known a person who in his youth was an extraordinary adept in music and performed on several instruments extremely well i saw the same person some years after and lo his musical talent was entirely lost and he was then a very good painter now i could not help forming a notion in my own mind that as our ideas depend on the fibers of the brain it was possible we might by the continual use of some particular one weaken it so as to make it perish and at the same time another might exert from that very cause itself with double strength thus i suppose when this gentlemans musical fibers perished his painting ones shot forth with vigor if there be any truth in this whim of mine which i own i am fond of believing myself we may easily account for the various dispositions which we meet with even in the same person at different periods of life  but to return although it is not in my power to give a succinct account of the deans life neither have i any intention to attempt it yet i believe i am better qualified to do it than most of those who have undertaken it as they were absolute strangers to him and relate things upon hearsay the dean for the latter part of his life contracting his acquaintance into a very narrow compass for as he was frequently deaf he thought this infirmity made him troublesome and therefore kept no company but such as he could be so free with as to bid them speak loud or repeat what they had said it was owing to this that mr p  n and i frequently passed whole days with him while numbers of our betters were excluded and as he was like another nestor full of days and wisdom so like him he was pretty much upon the narrative than which nothing could be more delightful to me as pleasure and instruction flowed from his lips his words drew audience and attention still as night or summers noontide air mil  i remember in one of these periodica fits of deafness for they returned on certain seasons on him he sent for me earl in the morning he told me when i came he had found employment for me so he brought to me out of his study a large book very finely bound in turkey leather and handsomely gilt this says he is a translation of the epistles of horace a present to me from the author it is a special good cover but i have a mind there should be something valuable within side of it so taking out his penknife he cut out all the leaves close to the inner margin now says he i will give these what they greatly want and put them all into the fire he then brought out two drawers filled with letters your task madam is to paste in these letters in this cover in the order i shall give them to you i intended to do it myself but that i thought it might be a pretty amusement for a child so i sent for you i told him i was extremely proud to be honored with his commands but sir may i presume to make a request to you yes says he but ten to one i shall deny it i hope not sir it is this may i have leave to read the letters as i go on why provided you will acknowledge yourself amply rewarded for your trouble i do not much care if i indulge you so far but are you sure you can read i do not know sir i will try well then begin with this it was a letter from lord bolingbroke dated six oclock in the morning it began with a remark how differently that hour appeared to him now rising cool serene and temperate to contemplate the beauties of nature to what it had done in some former parts of his life when he was either in the midst of excesses or returning home sated with them so he proceeded to describe the numberless advantages with which temperance and virtue bless their votaries and the miseries which attend a contrary course the epistle was pretty long and the most refined piece of moral philosophy i ever met with as indeed every one of his were and i had the unspeakable delight of reading several of them  nor can i be at all surprised that mr pope should so often celebrate a genius who for sublimity of thought and elegance of style had few equals the rest of the deans correspondents were the lady masham the earl of oxford dr atterbury bishop burnet lord bathurst mr addison archdeacon parnell mr congreve mr pultney mr pope mr gay dr arbuthnot a noble and a learned set so my readers may judge what a banquet i had i could not avoid remarking to the dean that notwithstanding the friendship mr pope professed for mr gay he could not forbear a great many satirical or if i may be allowed to say so envious remarks on the success of the beggars opera the dean very frankly owned he did not think mr pope was so candid to the merits of other writers as he ought to be i then ventured to ask the dean whether he thought the lines mr pope addresses him with in the beginning of the dunciad were any compliment to him viz o thou whatever title please thine ear dunciad  i believe says he they were meant as such but they are very stiff  indeed sir said i he is so perfectly a master of harmonious number that had his heart been in the least affected with his subject he must have writ better how cold how forced are his lines to you compared with yours to him see swifts libel on lord carteret hail happy pope whose generous mind   here we see the masterly poet and the warm sincere generous friend while he according to the character he gives of mr addison damns with faint praise  well replied the dean i will show you a late letter of his to me he did so and i own i was surprised to find it filled with low and ungentlemanlike reflections both on mr gay and the two noble persons who honored him with their patronage after his disappointment at court well madam said the dean what do you think of that letter seeing i had gone quite through it  indeed sir returned i i am sorry i have read it for it gives me reason to think there is no such thing as a sincere friend to be met with in the world why replied he authors are as jealous of their prerogative as kings and can no more bear a rival in the empire of wit than a monarch could in his dominions but sir said i here is a latin sentence writ in italics which i suppose means something particular will you be so kind to explain it no replied he smiling  i will leave that for your husband to do  i will send for him to come and dine with us and in the mean time we will go and take a walk in naboths vineyard where may that be pray sir  why a garden  i cheated one of my neighbors out of  when we entered the garden or rather the field which was square and enclosed with a stone wall the dean asked me how i liked it why pray said i where is the garden look behind you said he i did so and observed the south wall was lined with brick and a great number of fruit trees planted against it which being then in blossom looked very beautiful what are you so intent on said the dean the opening blooms sir which brought wallers lines to my remembrance  hope waits upon the flowery prime   oh replied he you are in a poetical vein i thought you had been taking notice of my wall it is the best in ireland when the masons were building it as most tradesmen are rogues i watched them very close and as often as they could they put in a rotten stone of which however i took no notice till they had built three or four perches beyond it now as i am an absolute monarch in the liberties liberties belonging to the dean  and king of the mob my way with them was to have the wall thrown down to the place where i observed the rotten stone and by doing so five or six times the workmen were at last convinced it was their interest to be honest or else sir said i your wall would have been as tedious a piece of work as penelopes web if all that was done in the day was to be undone at night well answered he i find you have poetry for every occasion but as you cannot keep pace with me in walking for indeed i was not quite so light then as i had been some months before i would have you sit down on that little bank till you are rested or i tired to put us more upon a par  i seated myself and away the dean walked or rather trolled as hard as ever he could drive i could not help smiling at his odd gait for i thought to myself he had written to so much in praise of horses that he was resolved to imitate them as nearly as he could as i was indulging this fancy the dean returned to me and gave me a strong confirmation of his partiality to those animals i have been considering madam as i walked said he what a fool mr p  n was to marry you for he could have afforded to keep a horse for less money than you cost him and that you must confess would have given him better exercise and more pleasure than a wife  why you laugh and do not answer me  is not it truth i must answer you sir with another question pray how can a bachelor judge of this matter i find said he you are vain enough to give yourself the preference i do sir to that species here a huyoniam i would as becomes me give place to but sir it is going to rain  i hope not said he for that will cost me sixpence for a coach for you this garden being at some distance from his house come haste o how the tester trembles in my pocket i obeyed and we got in a doors just time enough to escape a heavy shower thank god said the dean i have saved my money here you fellow to his servant carry this sixpence to the lame old man that sells gingerbread at the corner because he tries to do something and does not beg  the dean showed me into a little streetparlour where sat his housekeeper a matronlike gentlewoman at work here says he mrs brent take care of this child meaning me and see she does no mischief while i take my walk out within doors the deaneryhouse has i know not how many pair of backstairs in it the preceding dean who built it being it seems extremely fearful of fire was resolved there should be many ways to escape in case of danger  the dean then ran up the greatstairs down one pair of backstairs up another in so violent a manner that i could not help expressing my uneasiness to the good gentlewoman lest he should fall and be hurted she said it was a customary exercise with him when the weather did not permit him to walk abroad  i told mrs brent i believed the dean was extremely charitable indeed madam replied she no body can be more so his income is not above six hundred pounds a year and every year he gives above the half of it in private pensions to decayed families besides this he keeps five hundred pounds in the constant service of the industrious poor this he lends out in five pounds at a time and takes the payment back at twelve pence a week this does them more service than if he gave it to them entirely as it obliges them to work and at the same time keeps up this charitable fund for the assistance of many you cannot imagine what numbers of poor tradesmen who have even wanted proper tools to carry on their work have by this small loan been put into a prosperous way and brought up their families in credit the dean added she has found out a new method of being charitable in which however i believe he will have but few followers which is to debar himself of what he calls the superfluities of life in order to administer to the necessities of the distressed you just now saw an instance of it the money a coach would have cost him he gave to a poor man unable to walk when he dines alone he drinks a pint of beer and gives away the price of a pint of wine and thus he acts in numberless instances  my reader will i hope do me the justice to believe i was quite charmed with this account of the deans beneficent spirit and i no longer wondered so many of the clergy endeavored to depreciate him for as it is well known there are not in the general a more voluptuous set of men living this doctrine of selfdenial was enough to make them pour out all their anathemas on him and brand him with the name of atheist unbeliever and such like terms as they in their christian zeal thought proper to bestow  i before admired the dean as a person of distinguished genius but now i learned to revere him as the angel of ireland the dean running into the parlour threw a whole packet of manuscript poems into my lap and so he did for five or six times successively till i had an apron full of wit and novelty for they were all of his own writing and such as had not then been made public and many of them i believe never will mr p  n coming according to the deans desire to dinner found me deeply engaged and sat down to partake of my entertainment till we were summoned to table to a less noble part well mr p  n said the dean i hope you are jealous i have had your wife a good many hours and as she is a likely girl and i a very young man  note he was upwards of threescore you do not know what may have happened though i must tell you you are very partial to her for here i have not been acquainted with her above six months and i have already discovered two intolerable faults in her it is true i looked sharp or perhaps they might have escaped my notice nay madam do not look surprised i am resolved to tell your husband that he may break you of them indeed sir returned i my surprise is that you have not found out two and fifty in half that time but let me know them and i will mend of them if i can well put in says he for i believe you cannot but eat your dinner however for they are not capital i obeyed yet was very impatient to know my particular errors he told me i should hear of them time enough  the things being taken away now good sir said i tell me what i do amiss that i may reform no returned he but i will tell your husband before your face to shame you the more  in the first place mr p  n she had the insolence this morning not only to desire to read the writings of the most celebrated geniuss of the age in which i indulged her but she must also forsooth pretend to praise or censure them as if she knew something of the matter indeed her remarks were not much amiss considering they were guesswork but this letter here of mr popes she has absolutely condemned read it he did so take notice of it said the dean she would also have had me explain that latin sentence to her but i had some modesty though she had none you see why sir said i sure mr pope would not especially to you write any thing which even a virgin might not read now mr p  n said the dean is her curiosity at work i will be hanged if she lets you sleep tonight till you have satisfied it but this is not all she had the vanity to affirm that she thought herself preferable to a horse and more capable of giving you pleasure nay she laughed in my face for being of a different opinion and asked me how a bachelor should know any thing of the matter if you dont take down her pride there will be no bearing her  indeed sir said mr p  n it is your fault that she is so conceited she was always disposed to be saucy but since you have done her the honor to take notice of her and make her your companion there is no such thing as mortifying her very fine said the dean i have got much by complaining to you to have all your wifes faults laid at my door well sir said i all these misdemeanors may be included under the article of pride now let me know my other crime why said he you cannot walk fast but at present i excuse you well sir if i cannot mend my pride i will try to mend my pace mr p  n said he i have a mind to clip your wifes wit indeed sir said i that is death by law for it is sterling shut up your mouth for all day letty said mr p  n for that answer is real wit nay said the dean i believe we had better shut up our own for at this rate she will be too many for us i am sure if i was not proud before this was enough to make me so  the dean guessed right when he said i would not let mr p  n sleep till he had explained to me the latin sentence in mr popes letter which at my request he did and indeed none but such a wicked wit could have contrived to turn the words of our blessed savior so as to make them convey a very impure as well as a most uncharitable idea to the mind  feuds ran so high between my mother and mr p  n that my life became very unhappy so we determined to quit my fathers house for a little one of our own which my husbands father made us a present of and which by the bounty of our friends who came a housewarming to us was soon elegantly furnished there was a large garden to it which mr p  n laid out in a most beautiful taste and built a delightful summer house in it fit indeed for a nobleman here we usually entertained our friends here also we both invoked the muse mr p  n coming in curate by the removal of dr owens to a living of whose behavior to me in my misfortunes i shall have occasion to speak and by having the honor of being chaplain to lady charlemont with an annual allowance i had from my father our income was about one hundred pounds a year so that having no rent to pay and having my fathers coach and table always at our command we could in so cheap a country as ireland live in a very decent manner as dr swift mentions our doing in a letter of his to mr pope now published amongst others  the dean came to dine with us in our lilliputian palace as he called it and who could have thought it he just looked into the parlour and ran up into the garret then into my bedchamber and library and from thence down to the kitchen and well it was for me that the house was very clean for he complimented me on it and told me that was his custom and that twas from the cleanliness of the garret and kitchen he judged of the good housewifery of the mistress of the house for no doubt but a slut would have the rooms clean where the guests were to be entertained  he really was sometimes very rude even to his superiors of which the following story related to me by himself may serve as one instance amongst a thousand others  the last time he was in london he went to dine with the earl of burlington who was then but newly married my lord being willing i suppose to have some diversion did not introduce him to his lady nor mention his name it is to be observed his gown was generally very rusty and his person no way extraordinary  after dinner said the dean lady burlington i hear you can sing sing me a song the lady looked on this unceremonious manner of asking a favor with distaste and positively refused him he said she should sing or he would make her why madam i suppose you take me for one of your poor paultry english hedge parsons sing when i bid you as the earl did nothing but laugh at this freedom the lady was so vexed that she burst into tears and retired  his first compliment to her when he saw her again was pray madam are you as proud and as illnatured now as when i saw you last to which she answered with great good humor  no mr dean i will sing for you if you please  from which time he conceived great esteem for her but who that knew him would take offense at his bluntness it seems queen caroline did not if we may credit his own lines wherein he declares that he with princes kept a due decorum but never stood in awe before em and to the present queen god bless her would speak as free as to her dresser she thought it his peculiar whim nor took it ill  as come from him swift on his own death  i cannot recollect that ever i saw the dean laugh perhaps he thought it beneath him for when any pleasantry passed which might have excited it he used to suck in his cheeks as folks do when they have a plug of tobacco in their mouths to avoid risibility he frequently put me in mind of shakespeares description of cassius he is a great discerner and he looks quite through the deeds of men  seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing julius caesar  as the dean and after his example mr p  n were eternally satyrizing and ridiculing the female sex i had a very great inclination to be even with them and expose the inconstancy of men and borrowing a hint from a story in the peruvian tales i formed from it the following poem and i hope it will be acceptable to my fair readers as it is peculiarly addressed to them the statues or the trial of constancy a tale for the ladies in a fair island in the southern main blessed with indulgent skies and kindly rain a princess lived of origin divine of bloom celestial and imperial line in that sweet season when the mounting sun prepares with joy his radiant course to run led by the graces and the dancing hours and wakes to life the various race of flowers the lovely queen forsook her shining court for rural scenes and healthful sylvan sport it so befell that as in cheerful talk her nymphs and she pursued their evening walk on the green margin of the oozy deep they found a graceful youth dissolved in sleep whose charms the queen surveyed with fond delight and hung enamored over the pleasing sight by her command the youth was strait conveyed and sleeping softly in her palace laid now ruddy morning purpled over the skies and beamy light unsealed the strangers eyes who cried aloud ye gods unfold this scene where am i what can all these wonders mean scarce had he spoke when with officious care attendant nymphs a fragrant bath prepare he rose he bathed and on his lovely head ambrosial sweets and precious oil they shed to deck his polished limbs a robe they brought in all the various dies of beauty wrought then led him to the queen who on a throne of burnished gold and beamy diamonds shone but oh what wonder seized her beauteous guest what love what ecstasy his soul possessed entranced he stood and on his faltring tongue imperfect words and halfformd accents hung nor less the queen the blooming youth admired nor less delight and love her soul inspired o stranger said the queen if hither driven by adverse winds or sent a guest from heaven to me the wretched never sue in vain this fruitful isle acknowledges my reign then speak thy wishes and thy wants declare and no denial shall attend your prayer she paused and blushed  the youth his silence broke and kneeling thus the charming queen bespoke o goddess for a form so bright as thine speaks thee descended of celestial line low at your feet a prostrate king behold whose faithless subjects sold his life for gold i fly a cruel tyrants lawless hand and shipwreck drove my vessel on your strand but why do i complain of fortunes frowns or what are titles honors scepters crowns to this sweet moment while in fond amaze on such transporting excellence i gaze such symmetry of shape so fair a face such finished excellence such perfect grace hear then my only wish and oh approve the ardent prayer which supplicates thy love from neptune know o prince my birth i claim replies the queen and lucidas my name this island these attendant nymphs he gave the fairhaird daughters of the azure wave but he whose fortune gains me for a bride must have his constancy severely tried one day each moon am i compelled to go to my great fathers watery realms below where coral groves celestial red display and blazing dimonds emulate the day in this short absence if your love endures my heart and empire are for ever yours and hoary neptune to reward your truth shall crown you with immortal bloom and youth but instant death will on your falsehood wait nor can my tenderness prevent your fate twice twenty times in wedlocks sacred band my royal father joined my plighted hand twice twenty noble youths alas are dead who in my absence stained the nuptial bed your virtues prince may claim a nobler throne but mine is yielded on these terms alone delightful terms replied the raptured youth accept my constancy my endless truth perfidious faithless men enraged he cried they merited the fate by which they died accept a heart incapable of change thy beauty shall forbid desire to range no other form shall to mine eye seem fair no other voice attract my listening ear no charms but thine shall ever my soul approve so aid thy votry potent god of love now loud applauses through the palace ring the duteous subjects hail their godlike king to feastful mirth they dedicate the day while tuneful voices chant the nuptial lay love dittyd airs hymnd by the vocal quire sweetly attemperd to the warbling lyre but when the sun descending sought the main and lowbrowd night assumed her silent reign they to the marriage bed conveyed the bride and laid the raptured bridegroom by her side now rose the sun and with auspicious ray dispelled the dewy mists and gave the day when lucida with anxious care oppressed thus waked her sleeping lord from downy rest soul of my soul and monarch of my heart this day she cried this fatal day we part yet if your love uninjurd you retain we soon shall meet in happiness again to part no more but rolling years employ in circling bliss and never fading joy alas my boding soul is lost in woe and from mine eyes the tears unbidden flow joy of my life dismiss those needless fears replied the king and stay those precious tears should lovely venus leave her native sky and at my feet imploring fondness lie even she the radiant queen of soft desires should disappointed burn with hopeless fires the heart of man the queens experience knew perjured and false yet wished to find him true she sighed retiring and in regal state the king conducts her to the palace gate where sacred neptunes crystal chariot stands the wondrous work of his celestial hands six harnessed swans the bright machine convey swift through the air or pathless watery way the birds with eaglespeed the air divide and plunge the goddess in the sounding tide slow to the court the pensive king returns and sighs in secret and in silence mourns so in the grove sad philomel complains in mournful accents and melodious strains her plaintive woes fill the resounding lawn from starry vesper to the rosy dawn the king to mitigate his tender pain seeks the apartment of the virgin train with sportive mirth sad absence to beguile and bid the melancholy moments smile but there deserted lonely rooms he found and solitary silence reigned around he called aloud when lo a hag appears bending beneath deformity and years who said my liege explain your sacred will with joy your sovereign purpose i fulfill my will detested wretch avoid my sight and hide that hideous shape in endless night what does thy queen oerrun with rude distrust resolve by force to keep a husband just you wrong replied the hag your royal wife whose care is love and love to guard your life the race of mortals are by nature frail and strong temptations with the best prevail be that my care he said be thine to send the virgin train let them my will attend the beldam fled  the cheerful nymphs advance and tread to measured airs the mazy dance the raptured prince with greedy eye surveys the bloomy maids and covets still to gaze no more recals the image of his spouse how false is man nor recollects his vows with wild inconstancy for all he burns and every nymph subdues his heart by turns at length a maid superior to the rest arrayed in smiles in virgin beauty dressed received his passion and returned his love and softly wooed him to the silent grove enclosed in deepest shades of fullgrown wood within the grove a spacious grotto stood where forty youths in marble seemed to mourn each youth reclining on a funeral urn thither the nymph directs the monarchs way he treads her footsteps joyful to obey there fired with passion clasped her to his breast and thus the transport of his soul confessed delightful beauty decked with every charm high fancy paints or glowing love can form i sigh i gaze i tremble i adore such lovely looks never blessed my sight before here under covert of the imbowring shade for loves delights and tender transports made no busy eye our raptures to detect no envious tongue to censure or direct here yield to love and tenderly employ the silent season in extatic joy with arms enclosed his treasure to retain he sighed and wooed but wooed and sighed in vain she rushed indignant from his fond embrace while rage with blushes paints her virgin face yet still he sues with suppliant hands and eyes while she to magic charms for vengeance flies a limpid fountain murmured through the cave she filled her palm with the translucent wave and sprinkling cried receive false man in time the just reward of thy detested crime thy changeful sex in perfidy delight despise perfection and fair virtue slight false fickle base tyrannic and unkind whose hearts nor vows can chain nor honor bind mad to possess by passion blindly led and then as mad to stain the nuptial bed whose roving souls no excellence no age no form no rank no beauty can engage slaves to the bad to the deserving worst sick of your twentieth love as of your first the statues which this hallowed grot adorn like thee were lovers and like thee forsworn whose faithless hearts no kindness could secure nor for a day preserve their passion pure whom neither love nor beauty could restrain nor fear of endless infamy and pain in me behold thy queen for know with ease we deities assume each form we please nor can the feeble ken of mortal eyes perceive the goddess through the dark disguise now feel the force of heavens avenging hand and here inanimate for ever stand she spoke  amazed the listening monarch stood and icy horror froze his ebbing blood thick shades of death upon his eyelids creep and closed them fast in everlasting sleep no sense of life no motion he retains but fixed a dreadful monument remains a statue now and if revived once more would prove no doubt as perjured as before   i doubt not but the world will expect to hear from me some of the deans amors as he has not quite escaped censure on account of his gallantries but here i am not able to oblige my reader he being too far advanced in years when i first had the honor of being known to him for amusements of that kind i make no doubt but he has often been the object of love and his cadenus and vanessa seem to assure us that he was the favorite of one lady but to speak my sentiments i really believe it was a passion he was wholly unacquainted with and which he would have thought it beneath the dignity of his wisdom to entertain not that i ever imagined he was an enemy to the fair for when he found them docile he took great pleasure to instruct them and if i have any merit as a writer i must gratefully acknowledge it due to the pains he took to teach me to think and speak with propriety though to tell the truth he was a very rough sort of a tutor for one of my years and sex for whenever i made use of an inelegant phrase i was sure of a deadly pinch and frequently received chastisement before i knew my crime however i am convinced had he thought me incorrigibly dull i should have escaped without correction and the black and blue favors i received at his hands were meant for merit though bestowed on me yet though to my shame i own it i was fond of admiration to a fault and a little too much upon the coquette for a married woman i would at any time give up any pleasure or gaity for the more rationaln etertainment of the deans conversation  five years rolled insensibly away in a kind of tolerable happiness as lady townly terms it but that it seems i was not much longer to enjoy however before i begin to speak of offense and trouble i shall endeavor to enliven my narration with all the little amusing incidents i can possibly recollect  the following trifle as it was productive of a handsome letter to me from the dean and of more honor than i could possibly expect from it my vanity will not let me omit my brother teized me one evening to write some verse as a school exercise for him i asked him what i should write upon why said he pertly what should you write upon but the paper so taking it for my subject i wrote the following lines o spotless paper fair and white on whom by force constrained i write how cruel am i to destroy thy purity to please a boy ungrateful i thus to abuse the fairest servant of the muse dear friend to whom i often impart the choicest secrets of my heart ah what atonement can be made for spotless innocence betrayed how fair how lovely did thou show like lillyd banks or falling snow but now alas become my prey no floods can wash thy stains away yet this small comfort i can give that which destroyed shall make thee live   as the lines did not suit my brothers purpose they lay carelessly on the table when a lady of distinction who was going to england came to take her leave of us she would examine what i had been scribbling and seemed so well pleased with my rhymes that she did them the honor to put them in her pocketbook and i never thought more of them  about four years after this making a visit to baron wainwrights lady she told me she had got a very pretty poem from london wrote by the lord chancellor talbots daughter a young lady of but twelve years of age and desired i would read them for the good of the company but how great was my surprise to find they were the above lines however i went through my task and mrs wainwright asked my opinion of them and seemed impatient at my silence i told her the young lady must have wrote them at least four years before because i had seen them so long ago upon which the baron said that he also remembered them and that he was told by the person he saw them with that they were writ by a very young girl who was married to a clergyman in ireland my smiling made them guess at the person and at the same time excused me for being not over forward to praise them when i returned home i found a letter from mr p  n who was in london with a news paper enclosed wherein the above poem was printed i related this to the dean who ordered me to send the lines to him the next morning a lady came to visit me who told me it being the deans birthday he had received a book very richly bound and clasped with gold from the earl of orrery with a handsome poem wrote by himself to the dean in the first page the rest being blank and that dr delany had sent him a silver standish with a complimentary poem why then said i as the dean is furnished with paper and ink it is the least i can do to send him a pen so having a fine eagles quill i wrapped it into the following lines and sent it to the dean and also the bit of a news paper wherein the lines on paper were printed in london sent with a quill to dr swift upon hearing he had received a book and a standish shall then my kindred all my glory claim and boldly rob me of eternal fame to every art my generous aid i lend to music painting poetry a friend it is i celestial harmony inspire quills of the harpsichord when fixed to strike the sweetly warbling wire i to the faithful canvas have consigned each bright idea of the painters mind behold from raphaels skydipt pencils rise such heavenly scenes as charm the gazers eyes o let me now aspire to higher praise ambitious to transcribe your deathless lays nor thou immortal bard my aid refuse accept me as the servant of your muse then shall the world my wondrous worth declare and all mankind your matchless pen revere   on newyearsday i received from the dean the following letter deaneryhouse jan         madam i send you your bit of a newspaper with the verses than which i never saw better in their kind i have the same opinion of those you were pleased to write upon me as have also some particular friends of genius and taste to whom i ventured to communicate them who universally agree with me but as i cannot with decency show them except to a very few i hope for both our sakes others will do it for me i can only assure you i value your present as much as either of the others only you must permit it to be turned into a pen which office i will perform with my own hand and never permit any other to use it i heartily wish you many happy new years and am with true esteem  madam your most obliged friend and servant j swift     but as i have mentioned mr p  ns being in london i ought also to inform my reader what inducement he had to quit his family for a whole year which was as follows dr swift had in queen annes reign been the first promoter of alderman barber who afterward by many lucky accidents rose to be lord mayor of london which station he filled with distinguished abilities and retained so grateful a sense of the deans faur to him that he made him the compliment of nominating a chaplain to him the dean offered this honor to mr p  n who gladly accepted of it and came home in high spirits to acquaint me with his preferment but whatever joy it brought to him i was quite sunk in sorrow at the thoughts of parting for so long a time with one i so dearly loved all his friends were against his going and the late primate dr hoadly then archbishop of dublin remonstrated to him that serving under a person so remarkably disaffected as the alderman might very probably prejudice him in the eyes of the government but all in vain mr p  n was ever rash obstinate and selfwilled and should i add treacherous cruel and ungrateful i should not wrong the truth but however unwilling i am to speak harshly of the husband of my youth and the father of my children i must draw his character wherein i will  nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice othello  that he is both a scholar and a man of genius all who know him must allow but like mr pope he is so plagued with envy that he even hated me because i could write and took an invincible aversion to counselor smith because he excelled him on the harpsichord it happened one evening that this gentleman sung and played to us the oratorio of queen esther unfortunately for me i was so charmed with it that at the conclusion of the music i wrote the following lines to john smith esquire music once more her ancient power displays resistless now as in timotheus days our varied passions change at thy command our correspondent hearts obey thy hand who can untouched attend the awful sound when swelling notes proclaim jehovah crowned borne on the hallowed strains our souls arise till heaven seems present to our ravished eyes when to its source thy soul shall wing its flight and with eternal harmony unite thy skilful hand shall heavenly joys improve and add new rapture to the bliss above   as the lines were wrote offhand as to say the truth every thing of mine is for i am too volatile to revise or correct any thing i write mr smith complimented mr p  n on having a wife who could write better than himself he supposing mr p  n to be so much the lover that he would be delighted with my praise and join in it but lackaday he little knew what i was to suffer for the superiority of genius he was pleased to ascribe to me i then was continually told with a contemptuous jibing air o my dear a lady of your accomplishments why mr smith says you write better than i and to be sure he is a great judge but another unlucky accident likewise happened how fatal to me has praise been we supped at the deans and i had been reading out by his command some of his prosaic work he was pleased to say i acquitted myself so well that i should have a glass of his best wine and sent mr p  n to the cellar for it the dean in the mean time said to me i would have every man write his own english to be sure sir said i that would be best ay to be sure sir you give me an answer and p  x take you i am sure you do not understand my meaning very possible sir but i certainly understand my own when i have any well then what do you understand by writing ones own english why really sir not to confine ones self to a set of phrases as some of our ancient english historians camden in particular seems to have done but to make use of such words as naturally occur on the subject hush says he your husband is coming i will put the same question to him he did so and mr p  n answered to be sure a man ought to write good english nay but his own english i say his own what do you understand by that why sir said he what should i understand p  x on you for a dunce said he were your wife and you to sit for a fellowship i would give her one sooner than admit you a sizar  and now my business was completely done mr p  n viewed me with scornful yet with jealous eyes and though i never presumed to vye with him for preeminence well knowing he not only surpassed me in natural talents but also had the advantage of having those talents improved by learning and was sensible the compliments i received were rather paid to me as a woman in whom any thing a degree above ignorance appears surprising than to any merit i really possessed he thought proper to insult me every moment indeed he did not beat me which some of the goodnatured ladies have brought as an argument that he was an excellent husband but how a clergyman should strike a wife who never contradicted him and who was the most remarkably gentle even of her own soft sex i know not besides i had then a dear and honored father to protect me i am sure i may say with ophelia my violets all withered when he died then was i left defenseless to all the injuries my husbands subtle cruelty could devise against open unsuspecting innocence  another trivial accident also offended my husband he was one winters evening reading horace and said he would engage to write an ode exactly in his manner so he directly set about it the fancy came into my head to write one also though i understood not a word of latin nor knew no more of the poet than from the english translations my lines were as follow an ode i envy not the proud their wealth their equipage and state give me but innocence and health i ask not to be great i in this sweet retirement find a joy unknown to kings for scepters to a virtuous mind seem vain and empty things great cincinnatus at his plough with brighter luster shone than guilty caesar ever could show though seated on a throne tumultuous days and restless nights ambition ever knows a stranger to the calm delights of study and repose then free from envy care and strife keep me ye powers divine and pleased when ye demand my life may i that life resign   as i had finished my task first i showed it to mr p  n who contrary to my expectation for i imagined he would be pleased was very angry and told me the dean had made me mad that the lines were nonsense and that a needle became a womans hand better than a pen and ink so to bring him into temper i praised his ode highly and threw my own into the fire and here let me seriously advise every lady who has the misfortune to be poetically turned never to marry a poet but remember swifts lines what poet would not grieve to see his friends could write as well as he and rather than be thus outdone he would hang them every mothers son her end when emulation misses she turns to envy stings and hisses the strongest friendship yields to pride unless the odds be on our side   and if a man cannot bear his friend should write much less can he endure it in his wife it seems to set them too much upon a level with their lords and masters and this i take to be the true reason why even men of sense discountenance learning in women and commonly choose for mates the most illiterate and stupid of the sex and then bless their stars their wife is not a wit  but if a remark be true which i have somewhere read that a foolish woman never brought forth a wise son i think the gentlemen should have some regard to the intellects of those they espouse  but to return from this long though necessary digression and take things a little more in their order mr p  n contrary to every bodys advice who had any regard for him went for england i was very desirous of going with him but he told me plainly he did not want such an encumbrance as a wife and that he did not intend to pass there for a married man and that in short he could not taste any pleasure where i was as this was a secret i did not know before i received it with astonishment for amidst all his wayward moods i ever imagined till then that he loved me and that the many ill natured speeches he made me were rather the effect of a bad temper than any settled aversion he had taken against me especially as i observed he treated every body with contempt even persons every way superior to him the dean alone excepted to whom he paid even a servile complaisance and though he now fairly plucked off the mask and let me see my mistake i could hardly give him credit so unwilling are we to believe truth when it runs counter to our wishes  the next day he went on board the yacht in company with mr edward walpole to whom he was recommended by a man of quality since dead and left me and my three children almost without an adieu so eagerly did he seek his own destruction  i am hardly able to describe the various emotions with which my heart was agitated on his departure love grief and resentment for his last speech by turns possessed it however i received a very kind letter from him from chester which made me a little easy and as my friends seldom permitted me to be alone i did not give much way to melancholy  i believe it will be expected from the general reflections i have thrown out against the clergy that i should descend to particulars and expose by name the guilty but this invidious task i must decline besides as angelo says in measure for measure when he is tempting a virgin and she threatens to expose him who will believe thee isabel my unsoild name the austereness of my life my interest in the state may vouch against you that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny besides i should arm a formidable body against me who would not fail sooner or later to take ample vengeance as unforgiving as a churchman is become proverbial so as i am a sort of a priestess i will like a faithful motherconfessor keep the secrets of my ghostly brethren  i have another inducement to silence not i must own quite so goodnatured which is that i have a malignant pleasure in keeping those in awe who awe all the world beside which i should lose the moment i had done my worst i remember a certain gentleman who happening to be guilty of a venial transgression with a mean woman it unluckily manifested itself the gentleman was young and had a very severe father who gave him but a scanty allowance all of which did not satisfy the mercenary wretch of a woman who hoping to gain more went and told her story to his father the consequence of which was that she never afterward had a shilling from either the dullest genius cannot fail to take the moral of the tale so let the stricken deer go weep the heart ungalld go play   the innocent cannot take offense and for the guilty i will for the present with the charitable ghost in hamlet leave them to heaven and to the thorn that in their bosoms lodge to prick and goad them there   but once more to gather up my clue i received so passionately tender a letter from london from mr p  n that i quite forgot all his unkindness and sitting down to answer it without the least intention of rhyming the following lines flowed from my pen these lines dear partner of my life come from a tender faithful wife happy when you her thoughts approve supremely happy in your love o may the blissful flame endure uninjurd lasting bright and pure thus far in verse but can the muse descend so low as telling news or can i easily in rhyme inform you how i pass my time to sooth my woe and banish care i to the theater repair where charmed with shakespeares lofty scenes and pure inimitable strains my rapture raised so high appears it seeks to hide itself in tears on tuesday last all day i strayed in delvilles sweet inspiring shade there all was easy gay polite the weather and the guests were bright my loved constantia there appeared and southern long for wit revered who like the hoary pylian sage excels in wisdom as in age it is thus your absence i beguile and try to make misfortune smile but never can my constant mind a real pleasure hope or find till heaven indulgently once more my colin to my eyes restore p s permit me here ever i conclude to pay a debt of gratitude to worsdale your ingenious friend my praises and my thanks commend yet all are far beneath his due who sends me my husbands picture what resembles you   the dean had given mr p  n letters of recommendation to several eminent persons in england and amongst the rest one to mr pope who no sooner received it but he invited mr p  n to pass a fortnight with him at twickenham he not being yet entered on his office of chaplain i received from him from thence a letter filled with mr popes praises and the extraordinary regard he showed him introducing him to several noblemen and even oppressing him with civilities which he modestly attributed to mr popes respect for the dean and handsomely acknowledged the obligation as i thought this a very proper letter to communicate i went directly with it to the deanery the dean read it over with a fixed attention and returning it to me he told me he had by the same packet received a letter from mr pope which with somewhat of a stern brow he put into my hand and walked out into the garden i was so startled at his austerity that i was for some minutes unable to open it and when i did the contents greatly astonished me the substance of it was that he had in pure complaisance to the dean entertained mr p  n but that he was surprised he should be so mistaken to recommend him as a modest ingenious man who was a most forward shallow conceited fellow that in the hope of having an agreeable companion he had invited him to pass a fortnight with him which he heartily repented being sick of his impertinence before the end of the third day and a great deal more much to the same purpose by the time i had read it through the dean returned and asked me what i thought of it i told him i was sure mr p  n did not deserve the character mr pope had given of him and that he was highly ungenerous to caress and abuse him at the same time upon this the dean lost all patience and flew into such a rage that he quite terrified me he asked me why i did not swear that my husband was six foot high and did i think myself a better judge than mr pope or did i presume to give him the lie and a thousand other extravagancies as i durst not venture to speak a word more my heart swelled so that i burst into tears which he attributing to pride and resentment made him if possible ten times more angry and i am not sure he would not have beat me but that fortunately for me a gentleman came to visit him as i was in a violent passion of tears the dean did not bring him into the room where i was but went to receive him in another and i gladly laid hold of that opportunity of making my escape from his wrath  the next morning early i wrote him a letter expressive of the anxiety i was under lest i had any way offended him and assured him which was truth my tears did not flow from pride but from the apprehension i had that mr pope might influence him to withdraw his favor from us i added on my own part that even if i was partial to mr p  n i hoped it was the most pardonable error a wife could be guilty of and concluded with begging if he had any regard for my peace he would honor me with an answer by the return of the messenger i received the following lines madam you must shake off the leavings of your sex if you cannot keep a secret and take a chiding you will quickly be out of my sphere corrigible people are to be chid those who are otherwise may be very safe from any lectures of mine i should rather choose to indulge them in their follies than attempt to set them right i desire you may not inform your husband of what has passed for a reason i shall give you when i see you which may be this evening if you will i am very sincerely  your friend j swift     accordingly i waited on the dean about five oclock in the evening an hour i knew he would be free from company he received me with great kindness and told me he would write a letter of advice to mr p  n but said he should you acquaint him with this letter of popes he might perhaps resent it to him and make him an enemy how kind how considerate was this the dean then showed me the poem he wrote on his own death when i came to that part of it behold the fatal day arrive how is the dean he is just alive i was so sensibly affected that my eyes filled with tears the dean observing it said phoo i am not dead yet  but you shall not read any more now i then earnestly requested he would let me take it home with me which he did on certain conditions which were that i should neither show it to any body nor copy it and that i should send it to him by eight oclock the next morning all which i punctually performed  but the dean did not know what sort of a memory i had when he entrusted me with his verse i had no occasion for any other copy than what i had registered in the book and volume of my brain i could repeat the whole poem and could not forbear delighting some particular friends with a rehearsal of it this reached the deans ear who imagined i played him false and sent for me to come to him when i entered he told me i had broke my word with him and consequently forfeited all the good opinion he had ever conceived of me i looked as i think he generally made me do like a fool i asked what i had done he told me i had copied his poem and shown it round the town i assured him i had not he said i lied and produced a poem something like it published in london and told me from reading it about that odd burlesque on it had taken rise he bade me read it aloud i did so and could not forbear laughing as i plainly perceived though he had endeavored to disguise his style that the dean had burlesqued himself and made no manner of scruple to tell him so he pretended to be very angry asked me did i ever know him write triplets and told me i had neither taste nor judgment and knew no more of poetry than a horse i told him i would confess it provided he would seriously give me his word he did not write that poem he said p  x take me for a dunce i then assured him i did not copy his poem but added when i read any thing peculiarly charming i never forgot it and that i could repeat not only all his works but all shakespeares which i put to this trial i desired him to open any part of it and read a line and i would engage to go on with the whole speech as we were in his library he directly made the experiment the line he first gave me he had purposely picked out for its singular oddness but rancours in the vessel of my peace macbeth i readily went on with the whole speech and did so several times that he tried me with different plays the dean then took down hudibras and ordered me to examine him in it as he had done me in shakespeare and to my great surprise i found he remembered every line from beginning to end of it i say it surprised me because i had been misled by mr popes remark that where beams of warm imagination play the memorys soft figures melt away essay on criticism to think wit and memory incompatible things i told the dean he had convinced me the old proverb was false and indeed i know not how any person can be witty without a good memory when i returned home i found i had not been mistaken in the opinion i had conceived that the dean had burlesqued his own poem i had a confirmation of it in a letter from mr p  n to whom he had sent it to have it printed in london  my evenings chat with the dean furnished me with matter of speculation on that most amazing faculty of the human mind memory which according to my usual custom i threw into rhyme and hope it will not be displeasing to my reader memory a poem in what recesses of the brain does this amazing power remain by which all knowledge we attain what art thou memory what tongue can tell what curious artist trace thy hidden cell wherein ten thousand different objects dwell surprising storehouse in whose narrow womb all things the past the present and to come find ample space and large and mighty room o falsely deemed the foe of sacred wit thou who the nurse and guardian art of it laying it up till season due and fit then proud the wondrous treasure to produce as understanding points it to conduce either to entertainment or to use nor love nor holy friendship without thee could ever of the least duration be nor gratitude nor truth nor piety where thou art not the chearless human mind is one vast void all darksome sad and blind no trace of any thing remains behind the sacred stores of learning all are thine it is only thou recordst the faithful line it is thou make humankind almost divine and when at length we quit this mortal scene thou still shall with our tender friends remain and time and death shall strike at thee in vain lord let me so this wondrous gift employ it may a fountain be of endless joy which time nor accident may never destroy still let my faithful memory impart and deep engrave it on my grateful heart how just and good and excellent thou art   my reader may now plainly perceive i was most incorrigibly devoted to versifying and all my spouses wholesome admonitions had no manner of effect on me in short i believe this scribbling itch is an incurable disease for though horace says see his art of poetry  taking some physic in the spring rid him of it yet as he even relates this in flowing numbers we have no cause to give him credit he also declares all poets are visibly possessed and mad shakespeare seems to be of the same opinion though he describes it with greater elegance than even horace has done at least in the translation the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling does glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poets pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name the truth of which he has fully verified giving us in his divine works a new creation of his own with a new language also peculiar to the different species and orders of beings he introduces to us milton had studied him with care and like the be committed many sweet thefts on his immortal blooms whoever reads the part of the fairies in the midsummer nights dream may easily perceive how many beautiful images milton has borrowed thence to adorn his masque of comus and really i think as shakespeare had plundered all art and nature the visible and invisible world it was but just to make reprizals and steal from his rich store  i hope my reader will pardon me for so often running away from myself i cannot say i am egotist enough to be much enamoured of such an unhappy theme and have often wished i could do it in reality for i have been plunged in such calamity that i have even thought it impossible to be true and vainly hoped to wake as from some hideous dream to find a better fate  and as one traveling in a barren waste could not be displeased to be sometimes led out of the direct road to view a more agreeable prospect i deal thus with my readers and turn them from the gloomy vale of my life to relieve them with something more pleasing  to amuse myself d indeed with no other view i wrote in my husbands absence all the following poems which if they should not happen also to amuse my readers they are at their own liberty and may turn them over advice to the people of dublin in their choice of a recorder is there a man whose fixed and steady soul no flattery can

see with glittering glowworms begemming each tree well drink up the dew that impearls the flowers and in circling joys spend our circling hours if you fail in attendance by my scepter i swear my fairies shall bring you by force through the air   but however reluctantly i do it i must return  the following ode of horace bearing some similitude to my then present circumstances i took the liberty of paraphrasing and sent it to my husband notwithstanding his former lectures the seventh ode of the third book of horace paraphrased quid fles asterie asteria why will you consume in sighs and tears your rosy bloom no more your youthful husband mourn he soon shall to your arms return propitious winds shall waft him over enriched from britains fruitful shore in vain the nymphs display their charms to win him to their longing arms though strong temptations court the youth doubt not his constancy and truth they fixed as rocks unmoved remain while winds and waves assault in vain you only teach his soul to know the secret pang the tender woe for you he feels a thousand fears and often bedews his couch with tears ah then in kind return beware lest tempting words your heart ensnare avoid the dusk and silent shade nor heed the plaintive serenade let prudence that unerring guide over every thought and act preside so shall your faith and virtue prove worthy his matchless truth and love   mr p  n who loved me best at a distance wrote me a very kind letter wherein he told me my verses were like myself full of elegance and beauty that mr pope and others whom he had shown them to longed to see the writer and that he heartily wished me in london and this put the fancy into my head of going there and as some of my acquaintance intended for it with whom i thought i could agreeably travel i soon resolved to accompany them  mr p  n had been absent nine months a tedious time in a lovers reckoning in three months time his office expired for every new lord mayor of london has a new chaplain so i thought i should have the pleasure of passing the winter in london and then if nothing better offered we should return home together london has very attractive charms for most people as our irish nobility and gentry sufficiently evidence by spending the greatest part of their time and fortune there and can it be wondered at that a young lively woman should be fond of taking the only opportunity she might ever have of seeing its magnificence in perfection well but how to execute my project for i was apprehensive if either my own parents or mr p  ns were acquainted with it they would prevent me so i resolved to make but one confidante which was a very faithful servant who in the evening put my portmanteau aboard the yacht next morning the wind being fair i went under pretense of seeing my friends safe aboard down the river with them and into the ship as it were out of curiosity but being then out of danger of pursuit i told them my intention which some approved of and some blamed however as i did not question a kind reception from my husband and knew my children would be well taken care of by m parents i was very cheerful and easy and little regarded what was thought of my frolic neither could i divine that any evil construction would be put upon it  we had a very safe passage and a pleasant journey i wrote to mr p  n from parkgate and he and mr w  e met me about four miles distance from london so i took leave of my fellowtravellers for the present and went into the coach to them which drove to mr w  les mr p  n received me very obligingly and called me his little fugitive and runaway but a stranger would have thought mr w  le was my husband he welcomed me so kindly and paid me so many compliments as i had been up at three oclock in the morning i was heartily fatigued and desired mr p  n to take leave but he whispered me to invite mr w  le home to supper with us which accordingly i did and he was so transported with this civility he could not conceal his joy whatever i commended amongst his paintings he would force me to accept of and putting as many bottles of wine into the coachbox as it would conveniently hold we went to mr p  ns lodging which i found very handsome and convenient wine and good cheer entertained us till midnight to our mutual satisfactions  when mr p  n and i were alone he told me that though he was very glad to see me he was afraid i would have but a lonely time of it in london he being obliged to attend on the lord mayor from nine in the morning till six in the evening and from thence he always went to the play and afterward to supper to mrs heron one of the actresses of no very good fame though i thought this but an odd manner of life for a clergyman i did not say so being unwilling to offend him i had heard it whispered that he liked this woman but i resolved patiently to wait the event  the next day when he was going out i put him in mind that mr w  le said he would pass the evening with us but he laughed at my believing it and said he was a man so uncertain in his temper that perhaps i might never see him again while i lived just then a lady who came over with me called on us and mr p  n and she had some private chat when she was gone he told me she had brought him a letter and some poetry from the dean which he had ordered him to dispose of and put the money in his own pocket as he could not stay to read them he took them with him to the lord mayors  however mr p  n was mistaken in imagining mr w  le would fail in his appointment he came and told me mr p  n was at the play but would sup with us he made use of his absence to compliment me at an unmerciful rate and sung me all the tenderest love songs he could think of in the most pathetic manner in short he exerted his talents to entertain me and behaved himself so much in the style of a lover that had i not been married i should have imagined he intended to address me when mr p  n returned he told him he was certainly the happiest man living and wondered how he could be a moment out of my company where he could stay for ever mr p  n seemed much pleased with his gallantry and said he hoped i would induce him to see us often when we were alone he told me he believed his friend was in love with me i answered if he thought so i wondered he gave him so warm an invitation he said he was a very generous man and that his liking to me if well managed might prove very profitable for he valued no expense where a lady was in the case so it seems i was to be the bait wherewith he was to angle for gold out of a rivals pocket a scheme which had a twofold prospect of gain annexed to it for while a lover has hope he seldom quits the chase and will even thank the husband for taking the friendly freedom of using his purse and yet should the gallant be detected in taking any friendly freedoms with the wife in return the law is all against him damages and imprisonment must ensue which consideration may serve as a warning to all men not to invade properties or commit wilful trespass on their neighbors ground  if my readers are by this time the least acquainted with my spirit they may judge i looked on this project with the contempt it deserved however i promised complaisance which indeed mr w  les seeming merits might well deserve the next day i was invited to the lord mayors who on account of the resolute opposition he had given to the excise act was the darling of the people he was but indifferent as to his person or rather homely than otherwise but he had an excellent understanding and the liveliness of his genius shone in his eyes which were very black and sparkling he always treated me with great complaisance and gave me a general invitation to his table as the lord mayor was a bachelor he had a gentlewoman who managed his household affairs and who except on public days did the honors of his table mr p  n told me she was violently in love with him and was ready to run mad upon hearing i was come to london how true this might be i know not but as she was very civil to me and was old enough to be my mother i was not the least disturbed with jealousy on her own account though i cannot help saying she gave me a great deal of uneasiness by relating to me many instances of my husbands extraordinary regard for the player aforementioned we went together to the play on purpose to see her and to do her justice she was a graceful fine woman at least she appeared such on the stage and had a peculiar skill in dressing to advantage mr p  n and mr w  le were at the play they met us going out and mr p  n committed me to the care of his friend who had a coach waiting to convey me home but mr p  n went to his old rendezvous to the actress to my very great mortification because i really preferred his conversation to any other in the world however he was so complaisant he used every evening to send mr w  le to keep me company while he pursued his pleasures and as i shall answer it to heaven he did every thing in his power to forward and encourage an amor between his friend and me  one instance out of an hundred i could produce i submit to the impartial judgment of my reader one of the young ladies at whose house i first saw mr p  n happening to be in london and but in low circumstances came to visit me she insisted on my passing the next evening with her and just as i was going mr w  le came in and offered to accompany me to which i gladly consented hoping as he was then a man of interest he might recommend her to some good family as a governess to children or a ladys woman when he knew how well qualified she was for either place as her spirit was far above her ability i was concerned to see what expense she had put herself to for my reception having provided a very genteel supper to which she would oblige us to stay while she was giving orders for it i informed mr w  le of her distress who immediately gave me a guinea for her but entreated i would give it to her as present from my self which as i knew it was the only method to make her accept of it i did  when i came home i related to mr p  n mr w  les obliging and generous behavior but little was he pleased with the recital what could i think of him when he told me i did very ill to introduce a new woman to him i e mr w  le and that he hoped i would lose him and that henceforth he would bestow his favors on her a speech more proper for the mouth of one of those abandoned wretches who live by the sale of the innocent than for a husband a gentleman and one who ought to be a christian but i believe he was of opinion that let the malicious world say what it please the fair wife makes her husband live at ease and provided he sold me well and put money in his purse little regarded either my temporal or eternal happiness  another instance either of his extraordinary confidence in my fidelity to him or rather indifference about it was that he obliged me to go alone with his friend to windsor though as it was winter there was no possibility of going there and returning the same day it being twenty miles distant from london so that we had not only two days but a night also to pass together could any husband be more obliging to his rival than to give him such an opportunity to accomplish his wishes had mine but concurred i had then been undone for truly the gentleman tried every argument to win me to them but in vain my husbands misconduct in exposing me to such temptation stung me to the quick nay i could not help believing they were both in a plot to betray me to ruin and as we were at the top inn in the town i started at every noise of horsemen who stopped there and concluded though falsely i believe that mr w  le had given mr p  n a direction where to find us and as this imaginatlion wholly possessed me i little regarded either the elegance of our entertainment or the tenderness and passion the gentleman expressed in every word and look his soft endearments were all lost on one who regarded him as an enemy i was obstinately sullen and pretended weariness on purpose to quit his company but i lost all patience when calling to the maid to show me to my chamber i found there was but one nay and but one bed too provided for two guests for it seems my gentleman had so ordered it hoping no doubt to supply my husbands place  i was now in a manner convinced there was treachery intended against me and reproached my desiring swain in such bitter terms that he had no way to prove his innocence but by retiring though very reluctantly to another apartment and i took special care to barricade my own not only doublelocking it but also placing all the chairs and tables against the door to prevent a possibility of being surprised  i rose very early next morning to take a survey of what curiosities windsor afforded as it was too late the night before to see any thing but found nothing worth observation except the castle whose eminent situation and gothic grandeur might very well some ages ago make it esteemed a nonpareil but as it has frequently been described and celebrated i shall only say that considering it as the palace of the edwards and henrys i was touched with something like a religious veneration for it which no modern building could inspire me with  mr w  le attended me with great respect and excepting that he tenderly reproached me with what he called my cruelty the night before gave me no farther cause of displeasure but brought me safely home in his chaise to mr p  n  but pray gentle reader suppose it had happened otherwise that nightsolitude an agreeable and importunate lover should have prevailed on human yielding frailty whom could my husband so properly have blamed for it as himself he who best knew our frames bids us avoid temptation as the surest method nay and perhaps the only one of avoiding sin for who so firm that may not be seduced why then should he mr p  n drive me into the toils unless he meant to have me made a prey of  i fairly confess this action greatly sunk him in my esteem nay it even did the same in mr w  les especially as he reaped no satisfaction by it i could scarcely after regard mr p  n as a husband but rather as a man whose property i was and who would gladly dispose of me to the best bidder shocking thought  and yet this scheme was so artfully managed as indeed all his against me have ever been that i could not well reproach him for it for he would have alleged it was a party of pleasure intended by him for my health and recreation and to have mentioned mr w  les attempt why to say the truth i looked upon it as a thing which any man in the same circumstances might naturally be guilty of even though he had no previous liking to or thought of the woman so as there was no harm done i judged it most prudent to be silent besides no faults are so easily pardoned by our sex as those we believe to be occasioned by our own charms the eager lovers constant excuse and which our vanity is but too apt to admit as a reasonable one  of all things in nature i most wonder why men should be severe in their censures on our sex for a failure in point of chastity is it not monstrous that our seducers should be our accusers will they not employ fraud nay often force to gain us what various arts what stratagems what wiles will they use for our destruction but that once accomplished every opprobrious term with which our language so plentifully abounds shall be bestowed on us even by the very villains who have wronged us o heaven that such companions thou would unfold and put a whip in every honest hand to lash such rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west  i am sure the whole female sex will join with me in a hearty amen  mr p  ns year of chaplainship being near expired i hoped that he would return to ieland but he had entertained a belief that mr walpole would provide for him and therefore determined to stay in london so i was forced to return single for as mr p  ns income ceased with his office he chose to accept of an offer from mr w  le to lodge in his house for several reasons i thought it most proper to revisit my native country the first and chief was the affection i bore to my dear little ones the next to avoid both the temptation and scandal i must have suffered by going into the house of a person who with regard to women had an avowedly dissolute character  but however cautiously and prudently i acted in this affair it was not my good fortune to escape calumny so far from it that i was both traduced for going to london and for returning from it and the wife of a certain b  who invited me to dine with her a day or two after my return to dublin when we retired to our tea abused me in language i should have scorned in respect to my own gentility to have given to the meanest servant i was ever mistress of and because my husband had made me a present of a few little trinkets all of which in the expense amounted but to a trifle told me she was sure some gallant had given them to me but as i have since been informed she was ragingly jealous of me although without any reason i can the more readily pardon her inhuman treatment of me  but as i did not choose to bear reproaches i did not deserve i sent for a chair and bursting into tears left the room in the hall i met the b  who was coming to drink tea with the ladies he was surprised to see me so disordered and tenderly laying hold of me enquired the cause i desired he would ask his lady who had invited me to use me ill which he said he hoped she would not do even in regard to my condition being then pregnant but heaven knows had he but considered how cruel all barren creatures naturally are insomuch that i have seen a barren ewe attempt to kill a young lamb he would rationally have judged what might have even in law been my protection was the very cause of her hatred and displeasure to me  however as this lady was the first to attack my character i can do no less than return her these my public and grateful acknowledgments for though perhaps half the world cannot tell whom i mean yet as it is more than probable the person concerned may read over these memoirs she at least will know her own portrait  it is really a sad misfortune that the honest liberty of the press is so suppressed in ireland but however i promise all my subscribes to oblige them with a key to whatever secrets i have been obliged to lock up and many i have been obliged to strike out of my work otherwise i could never have had a single line printed  vice in power will command at least an outward homage and helpless poverty dare not either oppose or expose it  a few days after my return to ireland sir daniel molineux said in french to my brother in st anns church that he was surprised to see me look so cheerful considering my husband was in the bastile my broher told it to me but for my life i could not guess what the gentleman meant  but too soon i was informed by the newspapers that mr p  n mr motte and mr gilliver were all taken up on account of some treasonable poetry which mr p  n had given to the two latter to print i then recollected the papers aforementioned delivered to him by one of my female fellowtravellers  who was the informer i know not both parties having violently accused each other but in my soul i believe mr p  n was innocent and i am sure i have no reason to be partial to him but certain it is his character suffered so much that it almost broke my heart as it deprived me of any hopes even of his having bread for his family the notion of his having betrayed dr swift incensed the whole kingdom of ireland against him and as i did not for many weeks receive a letter from him i knew not how to justify him and when called upon by the late primate dr hoadly to give him an account of the affair i could only answer him with tears which as both he and his lady were exceedingly humane pleaded his cause as powerfully as the most moving eloquence could have done his grace bade me be comforted and write to my husband to come over and mind his duty and he would still be a friend to him and generously added that as many persons busied themselves in bringing stories to him to mr p  ns disadvantage i should be welcome to his table every day which would discountenance those who endeavored to prejudice him when they saw it did not make him or his spouse withdraw their regard from me  his graces goodness affected me so much that my tears of sorrow were converted to those of gratitude nor could i forbear falling on my knees to pay my acknowledgments to him and his friendly lady for the relief their kindness had given to a heart overcome with anguish  at length i received a letter from mr p  n which he was obliged to enclose to a gentleman for me otherwise it would have been carried to the castle and there examined so great notice was taken of these poems he wrote me word he had been ill of the rheumatism and in great trouble that he would directly return to ireland but that he had not money to bear his expenses i made an application to my father for him who bade me let the fellow go to the west indies and he would take care of me and the children but unfortunately for me i had too much goodnature to take this wholesome advice so far from it that i never ceased importuning him but followed him from morning till night like niobe all tears till he give me a bill of twenty pounds to send to him with which he came over to ireland but so pale and dejected that he looked like the ghost of his former self and the disregard he met with from every body went very near his heart every day there was a new abuse published on him my father battled for him and i did every thing in my power to cheer and comfort his spirits compassion wrought now the same effects on me as love had done heretofore and as he frequently wept i could not forbear mingling my tears with his and by way of consolation wrote to him the following lines no more loved partner of my soul at disappointments grieve can flowing tears our fate control or sighs our woes relieve adversity is virtues school to those who right discern let us observe each painful rule and each hard lesson learn when wintry clouds obscure the sky and heaven and earth deform if fixed the strong foundations lie the castle braves the storm thus fixed on faiths unfailing rock let us endure a while misfortunes rude impetuous shock and glory in our toil ill fortune cannot always last or though it should remain yet we each painful moment haste a better world to gain where calumny no more shall wound nor faithless friends destroy where innocence and truth are crowned with neverfading joy   i should not have dwelt so long on every trivial circumstance had i not been strangely traduced about this affair which as i shall answer it to god i have related with the utmost truth and exactness i never had any breach with mr p  n till our final separation and i am sure if my father had suspected me of any dishonor he would sooner have joined with my husband to prosecute me than have given him a single shilling to make up matters between us  neither can i really imagine what i had done to merit all the cruel and scandalous aspersions thrown on me especially by the ladies it would be infinite vanity to suppose envy had any share in their gentle breasts or that the praises i received from the other sex on account of my writings awaked their displeasure against me for though they had no title to aspire yet when i sunk they rose the highr   but what i think most surprising is that women who have suffered in their own reputations are generally most cruel in their censures on others i could mention a lady who was so fond of a certain colonel that when he died she was almost mad though he was a married man and yet she was heedful of the main chance in prevailing on him to leave her his estate from his wife whose brothers estate she had before secured to herself he being married to her i remember this lady the whole towntalk of dublin and yet by having a large illgot fortune she procured a second husband commenced prude though not till youth and beauty were fled and is if she yet lives one of the bitterest eenmies to any woman who has ever committed even an act of indiscretion that can be found in the world as i have proved many years ago by woeful experience so flavia full of inward guilt calls florimel an arrant jilt but enough of this when mr p  n was once more settled in his cure i being very much inclined to a decay my father said nothing would more effectually restore my health than the country so having often been invited to his brothers at cork i resolved on going there for a few months where i was very kindly received we took the diversions of the season at mallow where nothing remarkable happened to me except that one gentleman there took it into his head to do what they there call blackguard me incessantly it was the reigning humor of the place amongst the young folks to call names sell bargains and sometimes talk indecently all of which i abhorred and therefore this gentleman singled me out as a mark for this sort of wit and the more he found it vexed me the more he persisted in it at last i very seriously demanded of him what i had done to provoke him to teize me in the manner he did he said he heard i was a wit and wished i would write a satire on him so to oblige him i sent him the following lines which obtained me a truce from his antisublime conceits the mirror strephon since my skill you task and so often your picture ask lest my colors prove too faint such a various mind to paint i who never descend to flatter and abhor to deal in satire have at length contrived a way your resemblance to display i have brought truths polished mirror which shall show you every error and as faithful glasses do shall reflect your

farther cheerful amusement here commences the mournfullest tale which ever yet was either told or read  the winters return brought me to dublin my husband met me about a mile from town and took me and my aunt van lewens sister who came to town with me out of the stagecoach into a hackney one he entertained me with an account of a violent quarrel he had with my father and said he hoped if i had any regard for him i would never go with inside his doors this was a strange command and as strange did it appear to me that he should quarrel with the best natured gentleman in the world his father in effect as he treated him as his son i told him i hoped he would excuse my once disobeying him for i owed if possible a superior duty to my father than a husband could claim mr p  n was very angry this was on thursday night the next morning at all hazards i went to wait on my father who received me with a coldness which struck me to the heart i asked him if i had any way offended him he said mr p  n had used him so ill he did not desire to see his wife dear sir said i am i not your daughter yes said he and had you taken my advice in letting the villain go to the west indies i should have regarded you as such but make much of him and remember the hour will come when you will wish you had followed your fathers counsel my aunts sister was with me to whom he never once spoke but walked to and fro in a sort of a distracted manner and looked so ill that imagining my presence disturbed him i asked him where my mother was he said she was gone to take the air and that he had company to dine with him so that he could not ask me to stay i took the hint and departed from him in such inconceivable sorrow as i never in my life experienced before because i really loved him more than any thing in the world  i passed the remainder of the day in tears for my husband never came home till twelve oclock at night so that i had full liberty to indulge my sorrow i sent my compliments on friday and saturday morning to my parents they answered they were very well but they neither asked me to come to them nor came to me  on sunday i was invited to dinner to mr dubourgs i found myself so ill that i could not go to church however about two oclock i went to dine with my friends who looked on me with as much surprise as if they had seen an apparition they had no sooner seated me but they both went out of the room and held a long consultation at the door little did i think how deeply i was concerned in it at length mrs dubourg came in i tenderly reproached her with her coldness to me she said she was not well and asked me had i heard from molesworthstreet that day i told her i had not she asked me if mr p  n would come to dinner i told her he was engaged to preach at st peters church in the afternoon and therefore went to mrs warrens where they dined early a little while after counselor smith came in but they called him out and held a long conference with him in short every body behaved themselves so oddly to me that i knew not what to make of it  just as dinner was served up mr p  n came in my dear said i you are better than promise why says he i am not come to dine but to tell you your father is stabbed had he plunged a dagger in my heart it could not have given me a deeper wound  it seems this accident for such my father declared it to be happened at nine oclock in the morning and so unkind were my mother and sister they never sent me the least notice of it the company i went to had known of it some hours before and consequently were surprised to find me ignorant of what so nearly concerned me and what by that time all dublin knew none of them could find in their hearts to tell me of it and this was the occasion of the many consultations they held which had appeared so strange to me it would be tedious to my readers to relate every difficulty i had even to see my father in respect to the ashes of my mother i do not choose to tell how ill i was used upon this occasion but as i owe no sort of respect or ceremony to my sister if i may call her one who by no means deserves that title i must proceed i rose from the table had a chair called and went to my fathers three of the servants sat in the hall and my sister excessively dirty walked to and fro in it she would willingly have kept me out but however the servant knowing me opened the door the first noise which struck my ear upon my entrance was the deep and piercing groans of my dear father when i attempted to go up stairs to offer my duty to him my sister by violence pulled me down but the agony i was in for my father and the resentment i conceived at her gross usage of me supplied me with strength to get up in despite of her when i opened the dining room door the floor was all besmeared with blood my mother in an arbitrary voice asked me what business i had there i told her i had a childs right to pay my duty to my father she said if i spoke to him it would kill him upon which for the first and indeed the only time that ever i gave her an impertinent answer i said that if every person about my father had loved him with half my tenderness he would not have been reduced to the condition i was then too sure he was in upon this i offered to go into the bedchamber but was not only forcibly withstood but even beaten by my mother and again asked if i intended to kill my father i made her no reply but sat down and assured her that the first person who opened that door i would go in in about three minutes time dr cope dr helsham mr nicholls and in all seven physicians and three surgeons as my father was universally esteemed came of their own accord to visit him when i heard them on the stairs i took that opportunity to open the bedchamber door in which neither my mother nor my sister could well oppose me as the gentlemen were come into the dining room before they were apprised of my intention but heavens how shall i describe the agony that seized me when i beheld my dear father pale as death and unable to utter any thing but groans those only who have loved a father as well as i did mine can judge of my condition i kneeled down by the bedside weak as he was he kindly reached out his hand to me he asbed me if this was not an unhappy accident i begged he would not speak because mr nicholls had told me his lungs were wounded and that every word was detrimental to him but as i had not ever knowingly offended him i begged he would give me leave to pay my duty to him and that he would signify it by laying his hand on my head which he not only did but desired i would not leave him but here my father gave me an impossible task for no sooner were the gentlemen departed but my mother said she must speak with me and whether she was really mad or counterfeited to be so i know not but she insisted on my going to bed with her alleging that my sister was younger and stronger than i and better able to bear the fatigue of sitting up this seemed to carry the appearance of love and tenderness but heaven knows it was far otherwise as i afterward found out for the three following days my mother never permitted me to leave her if i ever attempted it she tore her hair and screamed like a lunatic the fourth night i heard my father ring a bell my mother was asleep and as my thoughts were ever on him i ran down stairs to him undrest as i was he seemed surprised to see me having been told that i was in my own house and would not undertake the trouble of attending him i found him in a very cold sweat it suddenly came into my head that if i could change that into a hot one it might perhaps relieve him so after assuring him that i had not quitted him nor had ever been out of the house but was prevented by my mother and sister from attending on him he said he was very dry and asked me what the physicians had ordered for him to drink as they all concluded he would not outlive that night they had ordered nothing but left him to take what he pleased as in spite of all precautions to the contrary i had overheard upon this i resolved so far to turn physician myself as to tell him they ordered him to drink some hock and sack made warm weak as he was he could not forbear smiling and saying he never heard of such another prescription ten gentlemen meet to order me some hock and sack mixed said he well give it me it must certainly be a cure for a pleuretick fever i did so nay i not only gave it to him that time but plied him with it every time he called for drink all night till it produced the effect i desired and threw him into a fine breathing sweat and a deep sleep it may now be demanded where my sister was all this time why as she had not if i may speak my mind half the regard for my father that i had she was fast asleep in the armchair nor could he awake her  when the physicians came in the morning they were agreeably surprised to find my fathers fever quite gone and his eyes look very lively he told them their merry prescription had done him gre rvice i winked at them not to undeceive him they understood me and dr helsham called me aside under pretense of giving me some directions but in reality to enquire of me what i had administered i told him and he could not forbear smiling he called the gentlemen into the next room to a consultation to which presently after i was summoned as both dr helsham and dr cope were men of wit and pleasantry they rallied me agreeably on presuming to practice physic having never taken my degrees and assured me i should be called before the college of physicians and be prosecuted as an empyrick  i rose up and making a low courtesy i told them as the best part of the college of physicians were then present they would i hoped have candor enough to permit me to make my own defense to which they all assented by a gracious nod and bade me proceed i then making another reverence told them that as to my right of practicing physic i held it extra judice and smiling said i supposed they all understood latin  but as their proper business was to destroy life i hoped they would not take it amiss if i for once in a case which so nearly and deeply concerned me had to the utmost of my power frustrated their designs neither had i presumed to interfere till they themselves had assured me all hope of my fathers life was gone and that he could not live till morning but said i making another courtesy i with all respect to this honorable board humbly presume to believe they had rather choose that he should die than their prediction prove a lie nothing except my fathers being so very weak and so very near to us could have prevented the gentlemens laughing heartily at my fine harangue however i was dismissed with honor and as my father seemed now to want nothing but restoratives i was directed to make him some viper broth hartshorn jelly chocolate and other nourishing aliments  from this time we entertained hopes of my fathers recovery in a few days he was so strong as to be able to sit up from morning till night the whole town seemed to participate in our joy and many who had never visited him before came now to congratulate him and his family on this happy change whether it was owing to his having seen too much company or to his own overneatness in insisting on having his chamber cleaned i know not but i received a message from mr p  n that he was taken very ill and desired to see me as i had flattered myself my father was out of danger i obeyed the commands of my husband and prevailed on mr nicholls to come to visit him he had got a cold and was a little feverish mr nicholls thought proper to take a little blood from him and i staid with him that night and part of the ensuing day mr p  n being much relieved gave me leave in the evening to go to my fathers where i found all things in confusion and he so ill that there was now not the least hope of his recovery he coughed incessantly was seized with what they call a galloping consumption and in a very few days after expired leaving me in inconceivable sorrow about an hour before he departed i left the room being unable to see his last agonies and went up to my mother who was as fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labor some time after i heard the windows thrown up by which i knew his mortal cares were ended  we had that evening engaged a nurse keeper but did not dare to let her into my fathers presence lest he should say as he once did on proposing such a thing that we were tired of him but now her assistance was absolutely necessary though my sister told me she herself helped to wash and lay my father out i am sure i could have died sooner but some persons have uncommon courage or rather as swift observes indiffrence clad in wisdoms guise all fortitude of mind supplies   about three oclock in the morning on newyearsday my sister came into the room and desired me to come and help her to take my father up that he wanted to rise though i was certain he was dead as i had not taken off my clothes i went with her and sent in the maid to sit by my mother i asked my sister on the stairs was my father alive she answered no so with a heavy heart i went into the dining room but by no means could i summon up sufficient spirits to look upon the claycold figure of him who under god was the author of my being my heart fluttered my tongue refused it is office neither had i the poor relief of tears  no wonder when the very spring and fountain of my life was stopped  the very source of it was stopped if the streams thereon dependant were for a while froze up and dead  while i was lost in melancholymusing my sister was very industrious in making the teakettle boil i do not say this by way of reflection on her for though i was less assiduous about it my own mouth was perfectly parched with thirst and i was very glad of something to moisten it  when the tea was ready unluckily we had no sugar nor was there any in the house but what was in the teachest the key of which was in my mothers pocket under her head my sister went up and waked her telling her my father wanted a little burned wine she readily gave it and prayed devoutly that it might do him good my sister came down laughing to think how she had imposed on her if any thing could have added weight to the intolerable burden of my sorrows i now felt it by considering how terrible my mothers surprise and disappointment must be  about six oclock i thought is was proper to send the chest of plate into dean maddens and to lock up whatever was valuable a prudent precaution as it too soon appeared after this i went into my mothers chamber she asked me how my father was i told her he had been very ill in the beginning of the night but was now very quiet she said she hoped sleep would do him good i answered i trusted in god it had so she arose and would not put on her shoes lest she should disturb him nay so strong was the force of her imagination that she even said she heard him cough as we passed by his chamber door but a sad counterfeit was i for when we came into his dressing room which opened to the garden as it was now daylight my mother easily perceived the concern in my countenance she shrieked when she looked at me and with great impatience asked me what ailed me o lord cried she cannot you give me one word of comfort i answered very faintly i wished it was in my power but alas her worst fears were but too true all was over i really thought she would now have run quite mad scarcely could i prevent her going into his chamber i sent in for dean madden who by prayers and spiritual advice a little calmed her but one woe trod upon the others heels mr nicholls who for the particular regard he had for my father was his first visitor and whose humanity during the whole time of his sickness deserves a grateful acknowledgment which if the surviving part of his family refuse i think it incumbent on me to pay so far at least as words can do it came into the dining room he guessed our loss ere we could speak it and seemed to bear a part in our sorrows he asked me what hour he should come to open my father i told him he had left his curse on any person who attempted it he said he was very glad of it for as this dismal operation must have fallen to his share it would i am certain greatly have shocked his humanity i would have had him go up to see my mother he said it would but renew her trouble and that when she was a little more calm he would make her a visit  i now thought it highly necessary to persuade my poor mother to take at least a dish of tea which i could not do but by assuring her i was ready to faint just as it was prepared a servant looking like a ghost opened the door and beckoned me to follow him i did so and upon coming down stairs found the house filled with sheriffs officers one of them whose name was williams was most remarkably insolent and abused me very grossly i once more sent in for dean madden i believe the worthy gentleman thought his words might prevail but the scoundrel williams bade him go talk in his pulpit however i had presence of mind sufficient to write a line to counselor smith he happened not to be at home so i begged of the dean to go to my mother least those licensed robbers should plunder the house about seven in the evening mr smith came he found the wretches very busy in taking an inventory of the furniture they were full as rude to him as they had been to the dean and at last carried it so far as to insist upon arresting my fathers body just then laid in a coffin i almost wild with grief ran after them the coffin was open and i raised my dear father in my arms and as if he could have heard me asked him would he not protect his family mr smith had in the mean time sent for the high sheriff he was a young goodnatured gentleman and after heartily reprimanding the fellows nay and even making williams beg pardon on his knees dismissed them all except one whom he ordered not only to be civil but also to do the work of a servant assuring us he would take an inventory of the things himself as soon as the funeral was over  the next day being sunday we determined to have my dear father buried according to his own directions privately at twelve oclock at night and i easily prevailed on mr smith and his present lady to give their company to my mother during the time of this last sad solemn ceremony as my mother wept incessantly it made her sleepy but the noise made in carrying down my fathers corpse awaked her and as she had only slumberd in her chair she started up crying out they were carrying her dear husband to the grave and that she would go and be buried with him we were obliged by violence to restrain her nay and also to assure her he had been interred some hours and that the noise she heard was only that of the servants who were setting things in order mr smith and his lady who according to their promise came and passed the evening with my mother said every thing that reason christianity or humanity could dictate to mitigate her afflictions gratitude for their kindness made her endeavor to supress the anguish of her soul nay out of complaisance to them she drank a glass or two of wine which as she had not done for some weeks before produced the effect i desired of making her sleep mr p  n attended the funeral obsequies which was the only proof of respect or kindness he ever showed to the family  early the next morning i rose and if in the melancholy situation of my soul any thing could have made me smile the cookmaids simplicity would certainly have done it for finding her fire made her dishes washed and every thing set in good order so well did the bailiff who was left in the house obey the high sheriffs orders in doing the work of a servant and he having walked into the garden the maid not recollecting there was any such person in the house stood crossing herself and praying to the blessed virgin and all the saints in heaven i asked her what was the matter o my dear madam says she my master was always neat and see for all he is dead how he made the fire and cleaned up the kitchen for me  i left the poor girl in her mistake and went up to my mother it grieved me to awake her yet knowing the high sheriff would be early with us and that the inventory of what was in her chamber must be taken i thought it was most decent for her to be up as her unhappy situation could not authorize her taking on the state of a lady of quality to lie in bed a month for fashionssake  she was not long up before the gentleman came from him i learned that this execution was laid at the suit of the widow ford who being executrix to her children had asked my father where she could lay out their money to advantage as mr monck wanted money my father immediately thought of him but as his estate was not liable to his debts my father became surety for him this was enough for me i immediately wrote to mr monck who on receipt of the letter came to town and with great honor not only discharged his own debt but also paid the sheriffs fees which in three days amounted to twenty pounds  this gentleman was the late henry stanly monck of st stephens green  my sister like all provident persons made the best of her way to her husbands mother who being assured by dean madden that he himself had married my sister to her son which had been questioned on account of his abrupt departure from her soon after he had made her a mother was so kindly received by her new parent that for three weeks after she never either sent or came to know what was become of the old one  as my father had positively prohibited us from writing any account to my brother then at paris of the misfortune that had befallen him i thought it not proper to disobey him yet at the same time judged it highly necessary he should be apprized of the melancholy situation of his affairs at home i therefore engaged a young gentleman an intimate friend of my brothers to undertake the mournful task and advise him immediately to return to ireland but his best speed could not overtake his fathers life who had been three weeks buried ere he arrived when he saw us in deep mourning and missed the dear parent who used ever to receive him with the love of a father and the freedom of a companion all his resolution could scarce support it and though he endeavored to comfort us twas but too visible he wanted it himself my heart bled for him so disappointed in all his hopes which as they had been high raised were now the more depressed in short we were all mere outside each endeavoring by a forced cheerfulness to conceal their inward anguish from each other  as my brother soon after sold off the goods by auction and placed my mother who was left entirely dependant on him to board at a clergymans house in the country after which i never saw her more i returned to my own house  mr p  n having now no expectation of a fortune by me he threw off all disguise and showed himself in his proper colors he had it seems while i was in the country in a bad state of health got in league with the widow w  rr  n whom he intended if i had died as was expected should supply my place however he was resolved to gid rid of me at any rate and as nothing but my death or a divorce could accomplish his desires the latter seemed the safer method to this end he set all his engines to work his first scheme i shall here relate  one morning pretty early he sent for me to come to him to breakfast in the summer house as i thought he was alone i ran to him quite undrest but was confounded at the sight of a gentleman whom i had never seen before and who was dressed out with the utmost magnificence and curiosity rather in the habit of a birthnight beau than a morning visitor i was for retiring but mr p  n obliged me to come in and introduced him to me i sat down with the best grace i could and made the tea before it was half over mr p  n said he was obliged to go visit a sick person but that he should return in half an hour engaging me not to let the gentleman go till then at the same time assuring him i was very well qualified to entertain him agreeably the gentleman did not express the least reluctance at complying with his request so far from it that as soon as he was gone he said he was much indebted to mr p  ns complaisance for the favorable opportunity he had afforded him of speaking his wishes and laying hold of my hand he began to address me in a most bombastic style with fustian from exploded plays for my part i thought he was mad and growing angry at what i deemed a great incivility to a married woman i assured him if he persisted in such impertinence i would quit the place he then begged pardon most humbly indeed for he threw himself on the carpet at my feet swearing he would never rise till i had forgiven him which not to be plagued with his farther impertinence i was forced to say i did he then wanted me to confirm it by a kiss but that i would by no means grant in short his company was so tiresome that i most impatiently longed for a release which however mr p  n was resolved not to give me so finding the gentleman was determined to prosecute me i told him i was engaged to dine abroad and hoped he would excuse my leaving him as i expected a lady to call upon me which laid me under a necessity of going to dress  upon this civil dismiss to my great satisfaction he took his leave promising me he would do himself the honor of waiting on me again very speedily to which i made no reply  i believe he went to mr p  n to give him an account of what had past who some time after returned and seemed much offended that i had suffered his friend as he called him to go away adding that he was related to the duke of dorset and might by his interest get him a good living i answered let him be ever so well related he was a very troublesome coxcomb and if he liked such company i did not  a few days after my youngest child died and that i might avoid seeing the funeral i retired to the summer house where i sat weeping when suddently this same fine spark opened the door he told me mr p  n had sent him to desire i would have some coffee ready and that he would be at home immediately i desired the gentleman to go with me to the dwelling house not choosing to stay alone with him at so great a distance from every body the coffee was prepared but no mr p  n came so we drank it without him and the gentleman fell into his old vagaries again i then all smarting with my griefs being vexed to be so pestered by a popinjay shakespeare burst into tears and demanded of him what he meant by such insolence he looked vy much confounded and asked me was i in earnest i assured him i was and that i would acquaint mr p  n with his rudeness he smiled at that threat and to my great surprise made me the following speech madam i am convinced by your behavior that you are a woman of honor and am very sorry i should be so unfortunate as to provoke your tears the best recompense i can make you is to entrust you with a secret and i doubt not but you will have discretion enough to make a proper use of it mr p  n described you to me as a lady very liberal of your favors and begged i would be so kind as to make him a cuckold so that he might be able to prove it in order to a separation from you promising to give me time and opportunity for it he assured me it would be no difficult task that i need but throw myself at your feet whine out some tragedy and you would quickly yield but i am now convinced that he is a very great v  n and very unworthy of you  i leave my reason to judge of my astonishment i could scarce give the gentleman credit and yet it was but too evident that he spoke truth as it was now nine oclock at night and mr p  n not come home to his invited guest  when i had recovered power to speak i told him i supposed mr p  n knew him to be a person destitute of all honor and humanity when he proposed such a scheme to him as that of betraying any woman faith madam returned he i never intended it for had you made me happy i would like a gentleman have forsworn it and also have given you a proper caution but i would not pay you so ill a compliment as not to assure you the bait was very illuring i believe there are very few young fellows who would have refused him the favor he desired of me i then begged he would be so kind to leave me which accordingly taking his leave very respectfully he did  i went to bed full of disquietude but the bitter anguish of my soul quite banished sleep i considered the snares were laid for me and that he who ought to be the guardian and protector of my innocence was the very first person who sought to destroy it i wept abundantly and prayed heartily to god to deliver me out of my trouble at length i fell into a slumber when methought my father just as i had seen him in his coffin drew open the curtain and muttered something to me very low and indistinct but the words trouble sorrow and shame i very plainly heard i started up and turned the head curtain back but seeing nothing concluded the trouble of my mind produced such terrifying dreams and recommending myself to heaven once more addressed myself to sleep when suddenly methought i was in the midst of a parcel of ruffians who were fighting and that i though i knew not why was the occasion of their quarrel at last i thought one of them gave me a severe blow over the head at which i screamed out and mr p  n who was now in the chamber waked me and asked me what was the matter i told him i had a very shocking dream why says he you grieve so much after your father and your brat and take no sustenance that it is no wonder you should be in the vapors i desired he would be so kind as give me a little water for i was in a faint cold sweat but as he always kept some cherrybrandy in his study he made me take a little of it which greatly revived me i then told him mr h  d had been to see him he asked me how long he stayed i answered till i was weary of him why did he offend you indeed returned i he did how said he by a great deal of impertinence not worth relating i suppose said he the coxcomb was repeating his poetry to you no returned i he spoke nothing of his own he had a proper authority i believe for whatever he said i looked earnestly in mr p  ns face and could easily perceive he was in great confusion so he put out the candle and came to bed without asking me any farther questions  early the next morning he went out of town without either leaving a shilling to provide for his family which consisted of a maid a footman two children and myself or any person to serve his cure neither did i for the space of two months hear from him or receive any supply till at last by accident i learned he was with the widow w  rr  n for the truth of this the reverend dr bradford can bear witness i mean so far as his going away without either asking his permission or substituting any person to do his duty but when a ladys in the case all other business must give place gays fables even in religion itself  i now beg leave to demand of every person who has been severe in their censures of me what duty love or respect was due to such a husband when an honest man is linked to a pesidious woman his misfortuns claim compassion b ure a voluntary cuckold is the meanest wretch in human nature and deserves nothing from the world but the utmost contempt  in the mean time the parish was quite in an uproar nobody to visit the sick or read six oclock prayers i related this part of my distress to my brother who prevailed on a young gentleman who had been his schoolfellow and companion then newly ordained to do mr p  ns duty  as for my two children i sent them to school and they dined every day with mr p  ns father the servants were forced to run in debt for provision and for my own part i quartered myself on my next door neighbors mr lindsay and his spouse where i always met a cheerful and friendly reception  i must here observe that because i loved reading mr p  n took with him the key of his study into which he had removed all my books presents to me from my friends before i was married he also locked up the garden rather choosing it should be overgrown with weeds and the plants and flowers die for want of water than that either i or the children should have the pleasure of amusing ourselves in it the teachest was also secured so i was left like a tame cat with the liberty of walking about through two or three empty rooms  when i had learned where mr p  n was i wrote to him but received no answer at length one saturday about twelve oclock at noon his horse was brought home and a mangy dog of which i was ordered to take a particular care which i did and now expected the master but as his buxom old widow and old enough she was to be my mother and big enough to make four of me came to town with him he stayed with her till twelve oclock at night his first question when he entered was where was his dog with which having played about half an hour hugging kissing and calling it an angel he at last vouchsafed to come up stairs i sat in my closet in a very pensive posture his first salutation to me was to ask me how i had the impudence to write to him about my family affairs i asked him to whom else should i write very fine returned he suppose mrs w  rr  n had opened my letter i could not suppose that sir because it is a liberty i never took with you you took with me why should you nay then said i why should she i have said he great patience that i do not turn you out of doors as soon as you please sir i know my way to st sepulchers and late as it is i dare say they will give me admission  i believe he thought he had now gone too far and was more than half afraid i would publish all his villainies so he fell into his old trade of dissimulation in which he is a perfect master and taking me by the hand told me he did not think so gentle a temper as mine could be disturbed at any thing and that it was very unkind in me to be disobliged at his taking a little recreation in the country adding that he often wished for me there i asked him why he did not take me with him he said he had proposed it to mrs w  rr  n but that she had objected against it telling him i was a woman of so bad a reputation that she would not for all the world countenance me i must beg leave to ask my readers what sort of terms this couple must be on when she took the liberty of traducing his wife to him she may be very chaste for aught i know but i verily believe many an unhappy creature who has even prostituted herself for bread would not have been guilty of her crime  cursed be he that parts man and wife is part of our ash wednesday service to which i say amen with all my heart and soul  but to return i told mr p  n i was extremely obliged to the lady that most men even if they hated their wives would resent any injury offered to them as being part of themselves but he was too good a christian for that so i arose and was for leaving the room he asked me where i was going i answered to sleep with my children for why should i sir go to bed to a man in whose person mind or fortune i have no longer a share and who has actually divorced himself from me as the law can do  however he insisted on my staying with him which accordingly i did we both rose pretty early and the children coming in to ask his blessing he whipped his daughter severely because as he said she resembled my mother though indeed she was infinitely more like his own and to show his impartiality he whipped the poor little boy for being like himself  when this scene was over the children were turned down to the kitchen and the mangy dog which it seems was given him by mrs w  rr  n invited to a good plate of toast and butter and half a pint of cream for his breakfast so well did he fulfill the old proverb love me love my dog  after these holy exercises he went to the communion which indeed i had intended to do but as he had really vexed me past my patience i could not compose myself sufficiently for the worthily receiving those sublime mysteries  thus we may see it is in the power of a bad man not only to destroy our temporal but also our eternal happiness  i saw no more of him till midnight buxom joan engaging him till then or in other words the widow w  rr  n  mr p  ns father hearing he was in town came the next morning to see him and demanded of him the money he had paid for his childrens tuition upon which he turned to me with an air of great contempt and told me he thought when he had married so accomplished a lady she might have taught her children to read write work etc and at least have saved him the expense of their education i told him and indeed it was truth that i should never desire a more delightful employment than that of cultivating their minds but that he ought to consider he left no support for our bodies and consequently i was obliged to go abroad every day to seek for food and could not encumber such company as i might be welcome to with my children here mr p  ns father interrupted me by saying i might always have been welcome to him indeed i doubt it not for he was a goodnatured man but as he kept an alehouse it was no very agreeable place for me to pass my time in  next morning buxom joan came in her own coach for her chaplain a right which most widows of fortune claim i looked at her and she hid her face mr p  n soon waited on her and away they went together leaving me just as desolate as i was before  mr p  n has often alleged in order to prove me an adultress as i was with child when we parted that he had no manner of matrimonial commerce with me for four years i was but just four and twenty years of age when we were separated and as my reader may observe he would not permit me to have a separate bed whether what he not only said but swore was true or false i do not see how he could gain any honor by it  for as the spanish friar says when old gomez boasts that his wife was a spotless virgin for him a fine commendation truly the church did not put you together for that   and here gentle reader give me leave to drop the curtain to avouch mine own innocence in a point where appearances were strong against me would perhaps little avail me the supreme judge of hearts alone will at the last great day clear or condemn me to whose unerring justice and boundless goodness i submit my cause  when snares and limedtwigs are spread for a poor bird it cannot well escape yet i may say with the condemned duke of buckingham in shakespeares henry the eighth we both fell by our servants therefore this receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you are not loose for those you make friends and give your hearts to when they perceive the least rub in your fortune fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye a proper caution to both sexes to be duly on their guard against confidants  i could reckon up numberless instances of mr p  ns aversion to me one in particular i cannot pass over one day at dinner the pin in the robing of my gown pricked my breast as there was no body but my husband and children present i made no scruple of uncovering my bosom to examine what had hurt me upon which mr p  n rose from table and said i had turned his stomach as i really had a fine skin and was then a most remarkably neat person i thought he only jested and merrily told him he should kiss my breast and make it well but alas it was not like priors lovers anger where when the lady complains that an ugly hard rosebud has fallen in my neck it has vexed me and plagued me to such a degree look here now you will never believe one pray see in the left side of my breast what a mark it has made so saying her bosom she careless displayed that seat of delight i with wonder surveyed and forgot every word i designed to have said for he told me he was sure he should faint if i came near him and either pretended to throw up his dinner or did it in reality after which polite compliment he drank a large glass of cherrybrandy to settle his stomach and repaired to his usual haunt i e to buxom joan  about twelve at night he returned and awaked me out of a sweet sleep by telling me i was a most expensive extravagant woman i asked him in what he said in putting on clean linen every day whereas mrs w  rr  n who had a thousand pounds a year assured him she never shifted herself but once a week and showed him halfsleeves which she wore to save the expense of washing i answered him very carelessly that i supposed that was what charmed him and therefore dirt to dirt  i beg leave here to remark that my husbands complaints were very different from those of most married men their general excuse for going astray is that their wives are dirty slothful ignorant etc the very reverse of which swinish qualities made my good man hate me well grant me guilty which never yet was proved yet i do think if wives do fall it is their husbands fault say that they slack their duty and pour our treasure into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousy throwing restraint on us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet we have some revenge let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it that they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and does affection breed it i think it does is it frailty that thus errs it is so too and have not we affections desire for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well or let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us to shakespeare  and in one of the sermons on social duties published lately by a real divine he makes this observation that he believes very few women have either been so weak or so wicked to wrong the marriage bed but when they have been provoked to it either by the ill treatment they received from their husbands or in revenge to their prior falsehoods  if i have not delivered the most worthy authors sentiments with his own elegance of style i am sure he will pardon me as i only quote from memory not being mistress of his admirable works  i do assure my reader i do not by those quotations mean to countenance vice or to arm my pen against the sunclad power of chastity milton so far from it that in my opinion nothing can excuse the breach of it and a female should strip herself to death as to a bed which longing she would been sick for rather than yield her body up to shame all i intend is this the world has been pleased to say i had a most excellent husband and therefore have thought proper not thinking their bill of accusation large enough to add ingratitude to every other vice and folly they are pleased to attribute to me  but so many yards of prunella and a bit of clear cambrick properly placed under the chin it seems make a holy man yet let us write good angel on the devils horn it is not the devils crest and so an outward sainted priest may in all his dressings titles caracts forms be an archvillain and his filth being cast appear a pond as deep as hell shakespeare  i hope mr p  n will return his acknowledgments to me for making him publicly known for as i hear his poems have suffered the fate of all things mortal and to use his own lines since he and his writings so soon are forgotten ever his carcass become like his principles rotten my muse shall forbid it transmitting his merits as the curious for show preserve monsters in spirits p  ns elegy on the rev mr graffan written many years before the gentlemans death and so if my quondam husband arrives at fame or ever goes to heaven either of which i very much doubt i think he must still rest my debtor for fame has but two doors a white and a black one the worst you say he is stole in at the back one and that cuckolds go to heaven no body ever yet disputed were he one he ought to thank me that helped to send him thither if i have bestowed on him fame in this world and salvation in the next what could a reasonable man desire more from his wife but some folks are never to be satisfied  but whether he is entitled to the horn or not must always be a secret i hope some curious commentator will hereafter endeavor to find out the truth of it for my mind gives me that i like the classics shall be read when time and all the world are dead and if a scotch barber one allan ramsay promises himself so much in a sort of burlesque on horace why may i not be indulged in equal vanity the ruling and darling passion of our sex though i shall never carry it to such an unnatural height as dr young makes a lady do when she is dying odious in woollen twould a saint provoke were the last words that dying flavia spoke no let a charming chintz and flanders lace shade my pale corse and deck my lifeless face one would not sure look ugly when ones dead and  betty give my cheeks a little red   i must beg my readers pardon for these numerous quotations but as swift says those anticipating rascals the ancients have left nothing for us poor moderns to say but still to show my vanity let it stand as some sort of praise that i have stolen wisely  at length the fatal hour arrived when mr p  ns machinations wrought the effect he so long desired namely my destruction and as he never did things by halves that of his own children also to whom his barbarity has exceeded any thing i ever either heard or read of but that in due place  i own myself very indiscreet in permitting any man to be at an unseasonable hour in my bedchamber but lovers of learning will i am sure pardon me as i solemnly declare it was the attractive charms of a new book which the gentleman would not lend me but consented to stay till i read it through that was the sole motive of my detaining him but the servants being bribed by their master let in twelve watchmen at the kitchen window who though they might have opened the chamber door chose rather to break it to pieces and took the gentleman and myself prisoners  for my own part i thought they had been housebreakers and would willingly have compounded for life when entered mr p  n with a cambric handkerchief tied about his neck after the fashion of mr fribble and with the temper of a stoic bid the authorized ruffians not hurt me but his christian care came too late for one of them had given me a violent blow on the temple and another had dragged two of my fingers out of joint the gentleman at the sight of mr p  n threw down his sword which he observing made two of the watchmen hold him while he most courageously broke his head  after this heroic action he told me who stood quite stupefied between surprise and pain that i must turn out of doors but observing that i was fainting he brought up a bottle of wine and kindly drank both our healths he would fain have prevailed on us to pledge him but we were not in a temper to return civility upon which he took my hand and very generously made a present of me to the gentleman who could not in honor refuse to take me especially as his own liberty was not to be procured on any other terms mr p  n kindly dismissed our guards and assured us as soon as ever he had obtained a divorce he would with great pleasure join us together in holy matrimony at the door the gentlemans sword was delivered to him mr p  n offered to kiss me at parting which mean piece of dissimulation so much in the style of jack ketch gave me the utmost contempt for the v  n  it was by this time two oclock in the morning and we knew not where to steer our course however the gentlemans servant always sat up for him and therefore he judged it more advisable to go to his own lodging than to search for any other and truly i little cared where i went  and here i sincerely assure my reader that neither of us even entertained a thought of any thing like love but sat like statues till daybreak when recollecting that i had nothing to change me with i wrote a letter to mr p  n to desire he would send me my wearing apparel or at least some clean linen  he complied with my request and wrote me a long letter wherein he seemingly expressed an infinite concern for my loss but as i had most strenuously recommended our children to his care he gave it then under his hand that he was perfectly convinced they were his own and that i might depend on his tenderness to them but at the same time as he was determined to be legally divorced he expected i would not give him any opposition in it  before i received this letter i had taken a lodging in abbeystreet up two pair of stairs where my clothes were brought to me together with it but not a single shilling to assist me my watch my books and even what few jewels i possessed before marriage were detained from me which threw me quite dependant on the courtesy of the person i was accused with  but mr p  n was so highly provoked at our not cohabiting together as he wished that he forced the gentleman to fly who having notice that there was an action taken out against him made the best of his way to london leaving a letter with five guineas enclosed in it for me in the hands of a dissenting minister who very faithfully discharged his trust  curiosity made me go to the gentlemans lodging to enquire of his landlady what she knew relating to him the gentlewoman was very obliging but could give me no satisfaction or light into the affair however she made me drink tea with her and we sat together till near nine oclock at night  at my return to my own lodging the maid told me my room was let i said that was odd as it was taken by the week and one not then expired to let it without giving me warning to provide myself which at that hour in a winters night it was impossible for me to do  the maid to whose care this house was entrusted for i know not who was landlord told me i might if i pleased lie in the first floor as the family were not come to town and there were only their servants in the house whom she could dispose of into worse beds but to my great surprise i found the lock had been taken off the bedchamber door which i will remembered had been on it in the morning as i had some difficulty to open it to take thence some china  i asked her the meaning of it she insisted positively that there never had been a lock on it which knowing to be a falsehood i began to be apprehensive some foul play was intended nor was i mistaken  i then asked her for a young woman whom she had told me was a servant out of place that lodged in the back parlour she said she was a bed in the garret and that my trunk was there also this gave me a sufficient excuse as there was no lock on the trunk to go up to her and as she had been a ladys woman and very well knew who i was i told her all my apprehensions and she readily consented to quit her own bed and come to mine  we brought down the trunk between us and placed it against the chamber door as the maid was busied with her new guests she took it for granted i was alone and therefore resolved to provide me with a male bedfellow as a proper consolation for a person in my unhappy situation  about seven oclock in the morning not then clear day she very furiously pushed open the chamber door and told me one mr b  k desired to breakfast with me who was a member of p  t and a man of fortune and the person who had taken the house i told her i never wished to see any human creature and should be glad i could hide myself even from myself but she supposing me to be alone directly introduced a man full six feet high and of the most disagreeable aspect i ever beheld  perhaps it was my terror that painted him so to my imagination  i started up and threw my gown about me but i was not quite so quick in putting on my clothes as the gentleman was in taking his off resolving without the least ceremony to come to bed to me i pulled my companion who asked him what he meant why who the d  l are you you old b  ch said he this lady meaning me is publicly known through all the coffeehouses in dublin had the gentleman been studying how to disappoint his own intentions he could not more effectually have done it as he brought all the horror of my condition full upon my mind and as i had no protector no friend no guardian i burst into tears and told him if he was a gentleman he would not insult misery do i occasion tears madam you do sir and and therefore i desire you will depart well madam said he i beg pardon i had a full history of you from the maid of the house who said she believed a companion would not be disagreeable to you especially as she was apprehensive you had no money sir said i she is mistaken i have at least enough to discharge my lodging which i will immediately do and once more i desire you to withdraw which accordingly he did  i then prevailed on the young woman who was with me to take a lodging for me and in about half an hour i went to it but now came the general slander charge which some invent the rest enlarge so from my heart i wrote the following lines sorrow while sunk in deepest solitude and woe my streaming eyes with ceaseless sorrow flow while anguish wears the sleepless night away and fresher grief awaits returning day encompassed round with ruin want and shame undone in fortune blasted in my fame lost to the soft endearing ties of life and tender names of daughter mother wife can no recess from calumny be found and yet can fate inflict a deeper wound as one who in a dreadful tempest tossed if thrown by chance upon some desert coast calmly a while surveys the fatal shore and hopes that fortune can inflict no more till some fell serpent makes the wretch his prey who escaped in vain the dangers of the sea so i who hardly scapd domestic rage born with eternal sorrows to engage now feel the poisonous force of slandrous tongues who daily wound me with envenomed wrongs shed then a ray divine all gracious heaven pardon the soul that sues to be forgiven though cruel humankind relentless prove and least resemble thee in acts of love though friends who should administer relief add pain to woe and misery to grief and often too often with hypocritic air condemn those faults in which they deeply shaer yet thou who do our various frailties know and see each spring from whence our actions flow shall while for mercy to thy throne i fly regard the lifted hand and streaming eye thou did the jarring elements compose whence this harmonious universe arose o speak the tempest of the soul to peace bid the tumultuous war of passion cease receive me to thy kind paternal care and guard me from the horrors of despair and since no more i boast a mothers name nor in my children can a portion claim the helpless babes to thy protection take nor punish for their hapless mothers sake thus the poor bird when frighted from her nest with agonizing love and grief distressed still fondly hovers over the much loved place though strengthless to protect her tender race in piercing notes she movingly complains and tells the unattending woods her pains mem my husband who was then suing for a divorce and thou once my souls fondest dearest part who schemd my ruin with such cruel art from human laws no longer seek to find a power to loose that knot which god has joined the props of life are rudely pulled away and the frail building falling to decay my death shall give thee thy desired release and lay me down in everlasting peace   i believe mr p  n would say with old sir paul plyant when he finds a love letter from a gentleman to his wife signed your dying ned careless ads bud i wish it were true but my kind companion never fear for though you may mistake a year though your prognostics run too fast they will certainly prove true at last swift but i had a fellowlodger one mr donnellan an ensign who it seems knew me so well that he thought proper to bring the late earl of r  sse of facetious memory and several other persons of distinction to break open my lodging on hearing them coming up stairs i ran into the dining room and locked myself in when those worthy p  rs could not find me they threatened to kick the landlady and one of them putting his mouth to the keyhole of the dining room cried do my dear open the door by heaven it is nobody but i d  g the fiddler i made no reply so being disappointed they were forced to decamp cursing and vowing revenge against the woman of the house  this accident so terribly alarmed me that i resolved to quit this lodging the next day but mr d  n was determined not to permit me to depart in peace for being a military man he stood sentinel at the door of my chamber all night frequently entreating me to let him in but truly had i been amorously inclined the sight of the various medicines in his apartment would have damped all passion sympathetic for as i had a back room when this gentleman was abroad i frequently for variety went into his which looked into the street  however at last he went to bed and early next morning he told the landlady that i had kept him awake all night and that i was a most notorious common s  t  arah by my shoul said the old dame you would make her one if you could what business had you and all those lords with her one of them bid the devil to break my own neck but i hope he will be hanged first  while my landlady to whom i had never told my name related this to me i heard somebody enquire for mrs pilkington so i desired to know who it was and up came a very well dressed matron like female of about fifty she expressed great concern for my misfortunes said my dear father had saved her life and that she was at present housekeeper to the earl of a  m who was extremely troubled for his rudeness to me and hoped i would give him an opportunity of begging my pardon i told her as i did not know whom to blame i wanted no apology it was my wretched fate to be subject to the insolence of every fellow  she then urged what i own was a prevailing argument to one not worth a shilling that my lord was very generous and would she was sure make me a handsome present in recompense of the terror he had put me into as i looked on my present circumstances to be quite desperate being near lyingin and having nothing to assist me i agreed to see him any where except at my own lodging upon which the artful old crone told me of a house in the neighborhood a very reputable one according to her account where my lord would meet me in the evening  accordingly i went but let any one judge of my surprise when instead of the earl i met a gentleman whom i had never seen before so i instantly departing left him to his contemplations and in process of time it came to light that the venerable housekeeper of the earl was neither better or worse than the celebrated mother brown and indeed i received many visits from ladies of her sublime calling  and what most surprised me was that they were generally employed by sober married men and such as to my own knowledge lived very well with their wives but these ladies assured me their husbands hated them and would rather have any other woman so i found i was not alone in my misfortune and if every married man who has ever attacked me does not subscribe to my memoirs i will without the least ceremony insert their names be their rank ever so high or their profession ever so holy i will dash the proud gamester from his gilded car bare the mean heart that lurks beneath a star and the more formal villains who in the robes of sanctity commit worse frauds then highwaymen surely ought not to remain unexposed for me while heaven affords me vital breath let them behold me as their scourge till death them through their serpent mazes i will pursue and bring each latent vice to public view and what their cunning studies to conceal shall be my constant pleasure to reveal till warned mankind shall from their mischiefs fly and hate them more if possible than i ay my little good lord cardinal i will scare you worse than did the midnight bell when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms mem my maid on the carpet    i once was acquainted with a prelate who had certain stated prices for all his sins as thus l s d for adultery     0 for simple fornication 0  0   for venial transgressions 0   0 each and yet he was a b  p and he wore a mitre which in all in good time may be surrounded with jewels of sulphur and nitre how nearly this b  p my b  p resembles but his has the odds who believes and who trembles   what i thought most cruel in him was that he never gave a farthing to the poor women themselves but to make up matters with heaven he took up ten bastards every year fed clothed and apprenticed them hoping no doubt as his dealings were pretty promiscuous some one of them might belong to him so how could his charity be better shown or whom should he provide for but his own   as i do not choose to be guilty of scandalum magnatum if nobody can guess who i mean i will fairly acknowledge myself to be as arrant a dunce as any b  p or parson in the world and really that is speaking largely considering what dullness reigns amongst our p  s priests and deans   and as milton observes on the devils breaking into paradise so since into gods fold climb thieves and ruffians and lewd hireling slaves turning the sanctuary of the almighty into a den   and it were to be wished that our blessed savior would once more come and drive those money changers out of the temple  i was again once more obliged to change my lodging and knew not how to provide for the approaching calamity i wrote to mr p  n who generously sent me sixpence by my eldest son to put me above the temptations to which want exposes our helpless sex for so he expressed himself in a long epistle he wrote with it  but when things are at the worst they generally mend for who should arrive from london but mr w  le he no sooner heard of my misfortune but he came to visit me and as he had a strange ambition to be thought a poet he assured me if i would devote my genius to his service he would liberally reward me to which i gladly consented as an easy and honorable method of getting a subsistence  i really would not be so ungenerous to strip the jackdaw of his borrowed plumes but that his usage of me in london was so inhuman that it merits a worse punishment from me than merely exposing his vanity and the world may conclude that of all the fine things which he keeps in the dark there is scarce one in ten but what has my mark though mr p  n and harry c  ry were his two subalterns or under strappers in poetical stockjobbing as mr w  le was a musical man my first task was to write a song for him which i performed in the following manner stella darling of the muses fairer than the blooming spring sweetest theme the poet chooses when of thee he strives to sing while my soul with wonder traces all thy charms of face and mind all the beauties all the graces of the sex in thee i find love and joy and admiration in my breast alternate rise words no more can paint my passion than the pencil could thine eyes lavish nature thee adorning over thy lips and cheeks has spread colors that might shame the morning smiling with celestial red would the gods in blessed condition our requests indulgent view sure each mortals first petition would be to resemble you   mr w  le showed this ballad to mr p  n who thought proper to alter the last verse giving it this profane and nonsensical turn could the gods in blessed condition aught on earth with envy view lovely stella their ambition would be to resemble you as for the gods envying mortals and wishing to be like them it has neither sense english nor even novelty to recommend it nor is it agreeable to the dictates of reason or religion for even a heathen author stands condemned for setting cato in a light superior to the gods but a christian divine may say any thing and so much for an old song  i thought my circumstances might have secured me from any farther attacks from the male world but it seems i was to have no more rest than the patriarchs dove had for i had a furious onset from a tinsel babbler blunderbuss of law newburghs hiena one c  n a person not otherwise known than by his being acquainted with all the tricks and roguery of the courts who because i treated him with the contempt he deserved railed at me wherever he went insomuch that i was obliged to compliment him with the following lines to counselor c  n why c  n with cruel aim seek you to hurt a wounded fame or how have i provoked your rage to bring me thus upon the stage it is true indeed i could not love you but why should that so greatly move you are you not used to plead in vain and practiced to endure disdain you tamely bear the scorn of men why vexed at it from women then when you approached me in disguise and swore to fifty thousand lies and more your self to recommend basely traduced your absent friend when you invoked each power to prove the truth and ardour of your love i looked through all the vile deceit saw c  n and knew the cheat thy wife with hide of well tanned oak may sure to rove her spouse provoke and you from cuckoldom be safe either from d  cy or from t  ffe and jealousy must be a jest for her whom all mankind detest take then some culinary fair nor seek a star beyond your sphere how could you hope to meet success unskilled in breeding or address unblessed with eloquence to move the melting soul to mutual love your lodgings gold and wine three dozn i scorned and eke to call you cousin and could thou dull impostor think to purchase me with gold or drink yet still in principles it is known we judge of others by our own and i excuse the fordid thought in thee whose soul is to be bought thy licensed tongue the law may murder but prithee mangle me no further for though my colors are too faint such glaring crimes as thine to paint yet i sometimes in black and white can draw a knaves resemblance right thy envy then and rage give over thou worthless mean rejected lover or in a print i swear to show you so like that all mankind shall know you   this did not happen to silence the fellow who now carried his impudence so far as to declare to all the lawyers at the rose club that i made love to him so recollecting a story his nephew who was married to my sister had related to me of a vile use to which he adapted three large folio volumes of his uncles philosophy i wrote the following ballad and pacquetted mr t  ffe with it at a time i knew several lawyers would be assembled at the tavern aforementioned and threatened mr t  ffe if he did not read it out for the amusement of the company he should be my next subject for satyr but no body so earnestly insisted on seeing the song as c  n himself to oblige him and entertain the company mr t  ffe sung it to the tune of chevy chase ye sons of science mourn with me in sad and doleful strains the loss which fair philosophy and literature sustains three volumes of enormus size o c  n had penned and lent them for to make him wise to an ingenious friend who on the puzzling pages pord three livelong summer days but could not understand one word for so my author says he through the palpable obscure gropd out his uncouth way where neither truth nor reason pure had shed one friendly ray in newton bacon lock and boil he found celestial light whose sacred beams oerpaid his toil but here reigned deepest night in famed laputas floating isle as gulliver has taught they swallow learning like a pill without expense of thought this way he tried but all in vain those writings never ascend they gravitations laws maintain and to the center tend enraged to find all methods fail these works he surely said may be adapted to the tail though never to the head these sybil leaves oh spite and shame in pieces torn he takes and wiped a part not fit to name and plunged them in a jakes wake c  n thy noble heart explore that hoary deep nor suffer thine immortal part in silence there to sleep or on the orifice all day thy nether end expose by whose inspiring fumes you may new systems yet compose henceforth be scorned great maros tomb and eke the delphic shrine for that famed privyhouse whose womb contains thy works divine   i have been credibly informed that this song made c  n blush which was more than any thing had ever done before however he took a copy of it which he promised to publish but finding he has not been as good as his word i must even be at the expense of doing it my self  but to return mr w  le came to me and told me he had been so unfortunate to disoblige a lady of distinction for not being apprized that she understood french and being asked in that language how he liked her he said she was an indifferent picture of her sister but he easily perceived by an alteration in her countenance that she too well understood him and that he was out of hope of obtaining her pardon unless something pretty could be wrote upon the subject by way of apology so i raised his spirits in about half an hour after by sending him the following lines to miss pl  kett a thousand different arts i tried to vary celias face and at each alteration spied some new resistless grace now cheerful mirth with gay delight shines in her eyes confessed now sorrow clouds their beamy light and heaves her snowy breast each different turn of mirth or spleen still gave the maid new charms anger alone remained unseen which every nymph disarms fair one can you forgive the art which did your wrath provoke alas far distant from my heart was that rash word i spoke and know this passion only showed new graces to my sight your cheeks with brighter beauties glowed your eyes flashed keener light like semeles my daring aim would on joves lightning gaze but sunk amidst the fatal flame and perished in the blaze   in the evening mr w  le returned and told me the lines had made up all matters that the other young lady said she wished he had affronted her so he had made her such a pretty apology i must beg of you now said he to improve that hint and write me some lines for her sister i readily writ for him these to miss betty pl  kett why fair one should thou wish thy friend thy matchless sweetness to offend alas thy beauty need not use this method to engage his muse since naught could keep her mute so long but fear thy loveliness to wrong when other nymphs my song require and bid me strike the sounding lyre to gratify the vainest she i tell her she resembles thee but not a bard since miltons days however elegant in praise possessed that dignity of thought to draw an angel as he ought   the lines had the desired effect and both the ladies were reconciled to the supposed author  my next task being a charitable one i could by no means refuse which was to write the following prologue for the benefit of a distressed person in jail a prologue spoke at the theater in smockalley this land for learning and religion famed in ancient times the isle of saints was named and heavenborn charity prime grace once more shall this blessed title to its sons restore a fitter object pity never could find for this divinest virtue of the mind than honest industry and worth distressed and suffering innocence by fraud oppressed by paleeyd want and sallow sickness pined within a prisons dismal gloom confined where everlasting sighs and anguish reign and each sad moment seems an age of pain it is yours to raise him from his dreadful care to soften anguish and remove despair the great and pious in the task combine and glorious emulate the power divine mercy her white celestial wings displays and to the throne of grace your zeal conveys whence thick as dew from heaven shall joys descend and endless blessings on your race attend   mr w  e now began to make some figure and though he kept me pretty fully employed he drove an underhand trade with mr p  n and as he was not willing that either of us should believe him incapable of writing he used to show mr p  ns work to me and swear it was his own and in return he with the same modest assurance presented mine to him but we were too well acquainted with each others style to be deceived at last mr p  n not satisfied with all the expense he put him to in london made a demand on him for fifty pounds but as mr p  n had before made the best penny of me to him he possibly could and w  le finding what i wrote passed every jot as well his he thought it most convenient if he did disburse any thing to give it to me as thinking i most wanted it so i was now full of poetical business by which my poverty was relieved and my mind amused  mr p  n was so vexed at losing his chap that in revenge he endeavored to insinuate that we conversed unlawfully together but this met no credit as i very seldom saw him and never alone  in the mean time he carried on a vigorous prosecution against me in the spiritual court in which i gave him no opposition as he solemnly declared he would always allow me a maintenance to the utmost of his ability and to live with him i by no means desired for never could true reconcilement spring where wounds of deadly hate so deep were fixed   but no sooner had he obtained a separation from me but he retracted every word he had said not only refusing to give me any assistance but also abusing me in the most unchristian false and scandalous manner and publicly triumphed in having overreached me upon this i was advised to lodge an appeal against him which made him quite mad he abused his advocate proctor and the judge himself as all doing him injustice and though i knew none of them insisted on it they were confederates with me against him  but this outrageous manner of proceeding rather injured himself than me the delegates were appointed and as every body whom he consulted assured him he would be cast his haughty spirit was willing to capitulate but nobody would undertake to deliver his message to me least he should scandalize them for it so at length with great entreaty he prevailed on w  le to make a proposal from him to me of giving me a small annuity and thirty pounds in money which in regard to my children i rather chose to accept of than ruin their father as i certainly had it in my power to do  w  le who has really a good deal of humor came to me one morning after my being a week without seeing him and in a theatrical manner delivered the following speech before i speak the message of the priest first give me leave to glory in the title of his ambassador  i wondered what odd whim had now taken w  le and begged he would deliver himself like a man of this world  he then related the proposal aforementioned on which i desired two days time to consider and then acquiesced and withdrew the appeal like an easy fool as i was  dearly have i since repented it as no articles of the agreement were kept although i thought they were as strongly assured to me as the law could make them in which there are so many loopholes that even persons conversant with it may be deceived how then should a female be sufficiently on her guard against the professors of a kind of unintelligible jargon whose skill is to puzzle the cause or a science where endless tautologies and doubts perplex too harsh a study for our softer sex   of the thirty pounds i never received but fifteen and those mr w  le assured me he advanced out of his own pocket and never was paid as i can prove under his own hand  but heaven knows as i had every thing to provide for a child and myself and rent also to pay this sum lasted not long especially as i had no friend near me  no nor any honest person for my landlady of whom before i had conceived a good opinion when she found i was in labor insisted either on my paying double the rent i had engaged for or quitting her house which as it was then too late for me to do i was necessitated to comply with her exorbitant demand which made her very complaisant  before i had received even this small relief i wrote to many ladies to whom my father had been physician and who once seemed to be my friends but to no purpose their constant answer was that i deserved nothing to which general rule i never met with but two exceptions  i wrote also to the b  p of c  who after long deliberation picked out of his purse half a piece which extraordinary bounty he by the force of imagination doubled and also declared that i had sent to him for it a woman who had been whipped through the town who as she really was a gentlewoman of good character but of low fortune had it not been for my persuasion to the contrary would have sued his l  p for defamation  but as he was so kind to give my son who is his godson five shillings in small change in london which he told the youth was a crown piece who knowing there was such a coin as a five shilling piece of gold searched amongst the halfpence narrowly to find it though without success i think i must pardon him especially as on my threatening to expose him since i came to ireland he to bribe me to secrecy sent me one pound a remarkable and unaccountable charity from his lordship to any person of whom he had not carnal knowledge  and though in a letter of his he assures me he desires no public praise for what he has done and makes as long and learned a disquisition between the law of our members and the law of our minds as he once did between graminervous and carniverous which as i do not understand latin i may very possibly mispel though their signification is i believe grass or flesh devouring animals of the later of which i believe his l  p would make the best meal the ancient priests were never permitted to burn flesh but as a sacrifice to the almighty but it is reported that one of them turning a stake when it was a little too hot burned his finger on which he licked it and found it so savory that he devoured that part which was intended for the gods and as the laity beheld him to their opinion breaking the law in eating flesh he assured them that he had an immediate revelation that it was lawful for him to eat the prime part of the flesh and leave the garbage for the laity thus we may see how early priestcraft began from the very first they were fleshmongers and priests of all religions are the same those who want to look farther into the deceits of priesthood may trace it up even to the nile from whence superstition and the crocodile first sprung both alike destructive to mankind  it is known to every learned divine that the priests engrossed the whole country of egypt as the eldest son of every priest was born a priest and was therefore entitled to a tenth part of the land upon which joseph who was not only an admirable man but an excellent politician and had a divine revelation that the land should suffer famine ten years ordered the priests to pay in all their subsidies to the king whereby in those ten years of dearth the king purchased at so low a rate as giving the people a little corn all the lands in egypt these are remarks of the admirable lord shaftsbury whose inimitable style and clear manner of reasoning carry conviction with them  i never knew any clergyman who quoted him but to his prejudice except dr turnbull and yet i cannot see why morality or the preaching of it should in any wise be offensive to a christian since there is a certain beauty in holiness which though it were never to be hereafter rewarded gives a sincere satisfaction and quietude of mind in this life  and therefore virtue does still with scorn the mercenary world regard where sordid minds do good and hope reward above the worthless trophies men can raise she seeks not honor fame or empty praise but with herself herself the goddess pays all i would infer from this rambling digression is that authority though it errs like other bears yet a kind of medicine in itself to skin the sore on the top and that subtilty and avarice have been almost inseparable from the priesthood ever since the world began  but to return having at length passed the pain and peril of childbirth by the care and humanity of dr arbuckle i was in great distress it is true mr p  n kindly advised me to leave my child which was a female one upon the parish and as he would willingly have done the same or worse to those whose legitimacy he never questioned i had the less reason to blame him but such a piece of inhumanity i from soul abhorred nor could any thing prevail on me to put it in practice  mr w  le went to mallow where at his request i sent to him the following poems the happy pair a ballad at dewy dawn as over the lawn young roger early strayed he chanced to meet with jenny sweet the blooming country maid her cheeks so red with blushes spread showed like the breaking day her modest look the shepherd took she stole his heart away with tender air he

heart and the virgins best resistance yields to this commanding art study this superior science would you rise in church or state bid to truth a bold defiance it is the practice of the great   in return he sent me the following lines which he assured me were his own verses to mrs p  n on seeing a poem inscribed to her the season she was at mallow in the lines if sappho lends a gracious smile be damned all critics of our isle the royal stamp is on those lays which second dacier deigns to praise propitious then attend my call my muse my goddess and my all mr w  le to mrs p  n thou azure

grief at sapphos fate the wonder of thy banks so late so many virtues were thy share thou most accomplished ruined fair one error sure may be forgiven and pardon find from earth and heaven that sovereign power who framed us all suffered the sons of light to fall and often to humble human pride from virtue lets the wisest slide ye fair no more her fault proclaim for your own sakes conceal her shame since if a nymph so good could fail we well may think your sex are frail   who wrote those lines i know not but as i am certain the author need not blush to acknowledge them i hope he will not only pardon my vanity in making them public but also subscribe to my writings  i can only assure the world i believe mr w  le never wrote a poetical line in his life and therefore i am indebted to some humane and ingenuous person who supposing me guilty makes an almost divine apology for me  but as it was impossible for me to subsist merely on praise i made one strong effort to deliver myself out of calamity which was to beg mr p  n to send me some money to bear my expenses to london assuring him i was weary of ireland which indeed was true for i am of the same opinion with the pleasant lady dorchester that dublin is a place of the least sin and the most scandal of any city in the world  perhaps the reverse would have better pleased her as the lord chief justice says to falstaff ld chapter just your waist sir john is very great and your means very slender   falst would it were otherwise my lord that my means were greater and my waist slenderer   this text wants no comment  but if my learned husband will oblige me with one i shall be his very humble servant he has threatened to give a true and impartial narrative of my proceedings to the public and i wonder why he who rides so fast has not got the whiphand of me i fear his appeal comes half an hour too late but courage my spouse though it cannot be said that on cloven tongue ever sat on your head i will hold you a groat and i wish i could see it if your stockings were off you could show cloven feet   i am a sad digressive writer by which my readers may plainly perceive i am no methodist  mr p  n agreed to my proposal and as he was fully determined never to give me any more sent me nine pounds for which as he said he sold my diamond ring to mrs dubourg and the chain of my watch which cost six guineas to mrs w  rr  n for the promise of forty shillings for which i suppose mr p  n and she have since accounted a goodnatured man will easily be satisfied with a lady that will return him a toy for a trinket  nothing that ever she got vexed me so much as mr p  ns giving her my fathers snuff box which he borrowed from me under pretense that taking a little snuff preserved him from catching sickness in places he was obliged to go to he declared to me he had lost it but i afterward saw it with her as also several other things belonging to me  but he is not the first man who has plundered his wife to oblige his  as this lady was i may say the principal cause of a separation between the parson and me i thought i had a right to demand a subscription from her which since my return to ireland i did in very civil terms and i think myself in duty bound to give my learned readers a taste of her excellent style in answer to me whoosomdever you aree i aboar you and yowr filthy idyous i submit my cows to the devil and fear nout hiss enemoys whileoust i a undder hiss preteckshon as to the parson you metown it is wile nowne what he iss he ruinged my sun by his ungraitfullnesse it is not in your power to defamatonous my corector in your wild memboirs so i am wythh harti prawours for yowr speedi deformation  yours      i really took great pains to find out the meaning of this elaborate epistle what i is future critics who are better skilled i broken english may decide but i do assure the public it is genuine which if they doubt i can produce it in the ladys own scrawl this lady sent a captain of a ship to me when she heard i was going for england to hurry me out of the kingdom which circumstance made me stay in it six months longer than i intended and having not yet done with her i cannot forbear remarking that one l  ty a painter a rude fellow a few nights after my separation from the parson took the liberty on not readily finding him in his own house of breaking open his bedchamber door to which the maid pointed where the lady and gentleman were administering christian consolation to each other illbred as he was when he found how matters were he begged pardon for spoiling sport but parson said he i did but follow your own example so he retired without drinking though invited share of the punch of which stood a large bowl before them but gold can work miracles make base noble old young cowards valiant ha this ye gods will lug your priests and servants from your sides this yellow slave will knit and break religions bless the accursed make the hoary leprosy adored this it is that makes the wappend widow wed again she whom the spital house and ulcerous sores would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices to the april days again but i suppose this widow was willing to have a taste before matrimony and i am certain mr p  n could not possibly have any other motive for liking this woman but merely that she was rich  i still continued scribbling for mr w  le to whom i sent to mallow the following poems on several occasions as he demanded them a song set to music by mr arne to melancholy thoughts a prey with love and grief oppressed to peace a stranger all the day and all the night to rest for thee disdainful fair i pine and wake the tender sigh by that obdurate heart of thine my balmy blessings fly o look to yon celestial sphere where souls in rapture glow and dread to want that mercy there which you refused below a song some for their forms i have desired and others for their wit admired yet fair one i can truly vow i never never loved till now no language can describe the pain which in your absence i sustain or paint the rapturous delight which swells my bosom at your sight so when the golden sun declines sad heliotrope her head declines but quickens with his vital ray and spreads her beauties to the day to a lady who defended the authors character while other females trifle life away in dress and scandal equipage and play stella with sense exalted and refined and each superior grace adorns her mind there friendship honor truth and virtue live with all the charms that art or nature give o how shall words my tenderness impart or speak the dictates of a grateful heart to thee fair patroness who could descend my character thus nobly to defend who would not wish to have sustained a wrong to have their cause supported by thy tongue so disappointed malice drops its aim and what was meant to sink exalts my fame the wishes a song o love by thy almighty power transform me to that newblown flower which framed for sweetness and delight attracts my loved almerias sight behold in vernal beauty dressed it decks the lovely virgins breast whence it superior grace assumes and with unrivaled beauty blooms why am i not that gentle air which flutters fans and cools the fair too happy zephyr balmy gale that fragrance from her breath you steal see while your pain you softly sigh and on her snowy bosom die thy goddess flora jealous grows and with divine resentment glows why am i not that bird whose note sweet warbling in his liquid throat bids every grove and vale rejoice his tender soft melodious voice nightly with his enchanting strain does in the woods my love detain til listening she forgets to fear the dangers that may threaten there when phoebus darts direct his beams almeria seeks the cooling streams the rivergod with pride receives almeria to his azure waves with murmuring joy they round her move and take her for the queen of love ye gods were i that happy stream how should my fierce my rapid flame  pardon thou bright thou matchless fair the bold presumption of my prayer gladly would i my being change gladly from form to form i would range might i in any shape delight almerias sense or please her sight or might those variations prove the truth of my unaltered love   these and fifty others of which i have no copy did this gentleman get from me almost for nothing  in the mean time having received an unexpected bounty from a gentleman of very high rank and distinguished honor i wrote to him the following lines to the honorable mr  admire not if the grateful muse with fond affection still pursues thee pride and glory of a race whom every muse and science grace they in thy generous bosom shine and lighten from thy eyes divine thus raptured i the strain essayed and begged apollos powerful aid the angry god in rage replied go check thy insolence and pride not that i blame thy happy choice but it is too lofty for thy voice who pine like thee with want oppressed forsaken comfortless distressed in vain attempt sublimer lays the beauteous work of minds at ease what though in early hours of life ere yet a mother or a wife i tuned thy infant voice to sing and placed thee near my hallowed spring my favorite swift thy numbers praised could mortal worth be higher raised yet i will no more thy wants supply since fortune leaves you so will i thy laurel chaplet now resign let mournful yew and cypress twine around thy melancholy head till thou art numbered with the dead nor dare to let thy female pen profane the first and best of men as well when with meridian rays i give the summer noontide blaze might thou expect to add new light to beams intolerably bright as hope to heighten s fame or add new luster to his name whatever adorns the wise and good by him is truly understood nor lives he for himself alone but humankind his bounty own convinced abashed i dropped my suit wonder and sorrow held me mute yet though i wake the string no more silent thy virtues i adore o let thy just superior sense forgive this last this fond offense led by despair the hand of death must quickly stop this vital breath his fatal power alone can part thy image from my grateful heart   at the gentlemans own request i omit his name but when i say he is the elder brother of the greatest man in this kingdom he may perhaps be guessed at  this worthy gentleman soon afterward fell sick on which i sent him the following invocation to health thou rosy goddess of the plains where innocence thy sister reigns if goodness can deserve thy care to godlike s couch repair let him thy matchless charms enjoy what nymph to  can be coy nor should thy favors be denied to him who spreads thy empire wide when want and all her gloomy train pining disease and racking pain on poor afflicted mortals prey his bounty drives those ills away swift as the shadows wing their flight before the purple dawning light come youngeyd maid serenely gay with healing looks and breath of may his virtues to our wishes give and guard that life by whom we live   mr w  le had the conscience to write to me to desire i would by the return of the post send him a hundred ballads of my own composition as he had already begun to take in subscriptions for them and on the receipt of them he would order a gentleman to pay me two guineas i suppose he thought i could write as fast as the poet whom horace describes standing on one leg while he wrote a thousand lines and because i was unable to comply with this request he sent me the following most strange epistle to mrs p  n d  n you sink you g  d fire you i have beggared myself between your scoundrel husband and you all to support a little dirty vanity when i want any thing from him his d  ned spirits are sunk nor has he given me any think worth a farthing for the monstrous sums he has drawn out of me i could write before i ever saw either of your ugly faces though not quite so well  and d  n me if i ever write another line of verse  you understand me  i shall be in town so as to meet the p  t the eyes of all europe are on me and d  n me if you do not send me the ballads but i will despise and defy you for ever  yours j w p s by g  i cannot stir out for my landlady has beat me through the town with a hot shoulder of mutton which she snatched from the fire spit and all only for catching me a little familiar with her daughter       i concluded by this letter that the poor mans head was turned and therefore thought it not worth answering being now seriously determined to leave ireland for though i led the life of a recluse i had every day some new story invented of me if i went out to take a little air they said i had great impudence to show my face and if i staid at home i was then in keeping with some man who confined me and in short i could please nobody which gave rise to the following lines expostulation o god since all thy ways are just why does thy heavy hand so sore afflict the wretched dust thou did to life command thou speak the word the senseless clay was quickned with thy breath chearless to view the beams of day and seek the shades of death through every scene of life distressed as daughter mother wife when will thou close my eyes in rest and take my weary life to the past present and to come are evermore the same thou knewst of all my woes the sum ere i my thoughts could frame twas thou gavst passion to my soul and reason also gave why did thou not make reason rule and passion be its slave o pardon me thou power divine that thus i dare presume at thy correction to repine or murmur at my doom lord give me penitence sincere for every error past and though my trials are severe o give me peace at last   so these were the last strains i sung in ireland which illused as i was in it i could not quit without very great regret and as the coach drove by mr p  ns door i thought my very heart would split with sorrow for there indeed was all the treasure of my soul enclosed namely my dear little ones many a sigh and tear they cost me many a prayer did i offer up to the almighty for their preservation and had he not been an infinitely more gracious father to them than their earthly one proved long long ago had they been finally lost  my eyes even after i went on board the yatch were evermore turned to the shore of ireland resting there as on their last period till finding myself observed and that some of the passengers colonel dalway in particular wanted to see my face which i concealed i pretended to be seasick and desired the steward to show me a cabin  he left me for a few minutes and returning told me all the beds were engaged but however there was a gentleman on board who said he would sooner sit up than a lady be unprovided for i returned my compliments without ever so much as enquiring to whom i was obliged  the sickness i feigned proved presently true for no sooner was the ship under sail but i grew violently seasick when the steward once more entered the cabin and told me the gentleman to whom it belonged desired a moments chat with me i begged him to make my apology as indeed what with sickness and sorrow i was little in temper to receive any person  however the gentleman resolved not to be so easily dismissed for following the steward into my cabin he told me he knew me to be mrs p  n that he could not sit up all night and therefore he hoped i would not refuse him the liberty of sleeping in his own bed  i answered i would not provided he would be so kind as to leave me for a few moments on which weak as i was i sprung out of bed and as i had not undressed myself soon met him upon deck  who this fame gentleman was may in due season be revealed i can only assure my readers that i believe had i accepted of the offers he made me poverty would never have approached me as he was a man of honor or at least appeared to me as such a man of fortune he certainly is and i doubt not but he has enjoyed many a lovely lady without promising them any reward or offering them a settlement for life as he really did me  i dined with him at parkgate and i hope virtue will be rewarded for though i had but five guineas in the world to carry me up to london i yet possessed chastity enough to refuse fifty for a nights lodging and that too from a handsome wellbred man whose name if i should insert all the world would acknowledge i spoke but truth of him  i shall scarcely ever forget his words to me as they seemed almost prophetic well madam said he you do not know london you will be undone there why sir said i i hope you do not imagine i will go into any bad course of life no madam said he but i think you will sit in your chamber and starve which upon my word i have been pretty near doing and but that the almighty raised me one worthy friend good old mr cibber to whose humanity i am under god indebted both for liberty and life i had been quite lost  i dare say nobody will imagine he served me from any carnal views since if truth in spite of manners must be told why really seventysix is something old   so here i close the first volume and as it has been industriously and maliciously reported that i had in reality nothing to publish i hope this will convince the world that mrs pilkington was never yet reduced to the meanness of falsehood or tricking and if this volume meets with a favorable reception i can assure my readers the next will be infinitely more entertaining and is now ready for the press  end of the first volume in the press and speedily will be published vol ii of this work which will conclude the whole
