a key to the lock  or a treatise proving beyond all contradiction the dangerous tendency of a late poem entitled the rape of the lock to government and religion  by esdras barnivelt apoth  london printed for j roberts near the oxford arms in warwick lane       the epistle dedicatory to mr pope though it may seem foreign to my profession which is that of making up and dispensing salutary medicines to his majestys subjects i might say my fellow subjects since i have had the advantage of being naturalized yet cannot i think it unbecoming me to furnish an antidote against the poison which has been so artfully distilled through your quill and conveyed to the world through the pleasing vehicle of your numbers nor is my profession as an apothecary so abhorrent from yours as a poet since the ancients have thought fit to make the same god the patron of both i have not without some pleasure observed the mystical arms of our company wherein is represented apollo killing the fell monster python this in some measure admonishes me of my duty to trample upon and destroy as much as in me lies that dragon or baneful serpent popery  i must take leave to make you my patient whether you will or no though out of the respect i have for you i should rather choose to apply lenitive than corrosive medicines happy if they may prove an emetic sufficient to make you cast up those errors which you have imbibed in your education and which i hope i shall never live to see this nation digest  sir i cannot but lament that a gentleman of your acute wit rectified understanding and sublimated imagination should misapply those talents to raise ill humors in the constitution of the body politic of which your self are a member and upon the health whereof your own preservation depends give me leave to say such principles as yours would again reduce us to the fatal necessity of the phlebotomy of war or the causticks of persecution  in order to inform you of this i have sought your acquaintance and conversation with the utmost diligence for i hoped in person to persuade you to a public confession of your fault and a recantation of these dangerous tenets but finding all my endeavors ineffectual and being satisfied with the conscience of having done all that became a man of an honest heart and honorable intention i could no longer omit my duty in opening the eyes of the world by the publication of this discourse it was indeed written some months since but seems not the less proper at this juncture when i find so universal an encouragement given by both parties to the author of a libellous work that is designed equally to prejudice them both the uncommon sale of this book for above  000 of them have been already vended was also a farther reason that called aloud upon me to put a stop to its further progress and to preserve his majestys subjects by exposing the whole artifice of your poem in public  sir to address my self to so florid a writer as you without collecting all the flowers of rhetoric would be an unpardonable indecorum but when i speak to the world as i do in the following treatise i must use a simple style since it would be absurd to prescribe an universal medicine or catholicon in a language not universally understood  as i have always professed to have a particular esteem for men of learning and more especially for your self nothing but the love of truth should have engaged me in a design of this nature amicus plato amicus socrates sed magis amica veritas i am  your most sincere friend and humble servant e barnivelt  a key to the lock since this unhappy division of our nation into parties it is not to be imagined how many artifices have been made use of by writers to obscure the truth and cover designs which may be detrimental to the public in particular it has been their custom of late to vent their political spleen in allegory and fable if an honest believing nation is to be made a jest of we have a story of john bull and his wife if a treasurer is to be glanced at an ant with a white straw is introduced if a treaty of commerce is to be ridiculed it is immediately metamorphosed into a tale of count tariff  but if any of these malevolents have never so small a talent in rhyme they principally delight to convey their malice in that pleasing way as it were gilding the pill and concealing the poison under the sweetness of numbers who could imagine that an original canto of spencer should contain a satyr upon one administration or that yarhels kitchen or the dogs of egypt should be a sarcasm upon another  it is the duty of every well designing subject to prevent as far as in him lies the ill consequences of such pernicious treatises and i hold it mine to warn the public of the late poem entitled the rape of the lock which i shall demonstrate to be of this nature many of these sort of books have been bought by honest and wellmeaning people purely for their diversion who have in the end found themselves insensibly led into the violence of party spirit and many domestic quarrels have been occasioned by the different application of these books the wife of an eminent citizen grew very noisy upon reading bob hush john bull upon change was thought not only to concern the state but to affront the city and the poem we are now treating of has not only dissolved an agreeable assembly of beaus and belles but as i am told has set relations at as great a distance as if they were married together  it is a common and just observation that when the meaning of any thing is dubious one can no way better judge of the true intent of it than by considering who is the author what is his character in general and his disposition in particular  now that the author of this poem is professedly a papist is well known and that a genius so capable of doing service to that cause may have been corrupted in the course of his education by jesuits or others is justly very much to be suspected notwithstanding that seeming coolness and moderation which he has been perhaps artfully reproached with by those of his own profession they are sensible that this nation is secured with good and wholesome laws to prevent all evil practices of the church of rome particularly the publication of books that may in any sort propagate that doctrine their authors are therefore obliged to couch their designs the deeper and though i cannot averr that the intention of this gentleman was directly to spread popish doctrines yet it comes to the same point if he touch the government for the court of rome knows very well that the church at this time is so firmly founded on the state that the only way to shake the one is by attacking the other  what confirms me in this opinion is an accidental discovery i made of a very artful piece of management among his popish friends and abettors to hide this whole design upon the government by taking all the characters upon themselves  upon the day that this poem was published it was my fortune to step into the cocoa tree where a certain gentleman was railing very liberally at the author with a passion extremely well counterfeited for having as he said reflected upon him in the character of sir plume upon his going out i enquired who he was and they told me a roman catholic knight  i was the same evening at wills and saw a circle round another gentleman who was railing in like manner and showing his snuffbox and cane to prove he was satyrized in the same character i asked this gentlemans name and was told he was a roman catholic lord  a day or two after i was sent for upon a slight indisposition to the young ladys to whom the poem is dedicated she also took up the character of belinda with much frankness and good humor though the author has given us a key in his the character of belinda as it is here managed resemble you in nothing but in beauty dedication to the rape of the lock dedication that he meant something further this lady is also a roman catholic at the same time others of the characters were claimed by some persons in the room and all of them roman catholics  but to proceed to the work it self  in all things which are intricate as allegories in their own nature are and especially those that are industriously made so it is not to be expected we should find the clue at first sight but when once we have laid hold on that we shall trace this our author through all the labyrinths doublings and turnings of this intricate composition  first then let it be observed that in the most demonstrative sciences some postulata are to be granted upon which the rest is naturally founded i shall desire no more than one postulatum to render this obvious to the meanest capacity which being granted me i shall not only show the intent of this work in general but also explain the very names and expose all his fictitious characters in their true light and we shall find that even his spirits were not merely contrived for the sake of machinary  the only concession which i desire to be made me is that by the lock is meant the barrier treaty   i first then i shall discover that belinda represents great britain or which is the same thing her late majesty this is plainly seen in his description of her on her white breast a sparkling cross she bore alluding to the ancient name of albion from her white cliffs and to the cross which is the ensign of england  ii the baron who cuts off the lock or barrier treaty is the e of od  iii clarissa who lent the scissars my lady mm  iv thalestris who provokes belinda to resent the loss of the lock or treaty the ds of mgh  v sir plume who is moved by thalestris to redemand it of great britain pce eune who came hither for that purpose  there are other inferior characters which we shall observe upon afterward but i shall first explain the foregoing  the first part of the barons character is his being adventrous or enterprizing which is the common epithet given the e of od by his enemies the prize he aspires to is the ty in order to which he offers a sacrifice  an altar built of twelve vast french romances neatly gilt our author here takes occasion maliciously to insinuate this statesmans love to france representing the books he chiefly studies to be vast french romances these are the vast prospects from the friendship and alliance of france which he satyrically calls romances hinting thereby that these promises and protestations were no more to be relied on than those idle legends of these he is said to build an altar to intimate that all the foundation of his schemes and honors was fixed upon the french romances abovementioned a fan a garter half a pair of gloves one of the things he sacrifices is a fan which both for its gaudy show and perpetual fluttering has been made the emblem of woman this points at the change of the ladies of the bedchamber the garter alludes to the honors he conferred on some of his friends and we may without straining the sense call the half pair of gloves a gauntlet the token of those military employments which he is said to have sacrificed to his designs the prize as i said before means the ty which he makes it his prayers soon to obtain and long to possess the powers gave ear and granted half his prayer the rest the winds dispersed in empty air in the first of these lines he gives him the ty and in the last suggests that he should not long possess that honor  that thalestris is the ds of mgh appears both by her nearness to belinda and by this authors malevolent suggestion that she is a lover of war to arms to arms the bold thalestris cries but more particularly in several passages in her speech to belinda upon the cutting off the lock or treaty among other things she says was it for this you bound your locks in paper durance was it for this so much paper has been spent to secure the barrier treaty methinks already i your tears survey already hear the horrid things they say already see you a degraded toast this describes the aspersions under which that good princess suffered and the repentance which must have followed the dissolution of that treaty and particularly levels at the refusal some people made to drink her mys health  sir plume a proper name for a soldier has all the circumstances that agree with pce eune sir plume of amber snuff box justly vain and the nice conduct of a clouded cane with earnest eyes  it is remarkable this general is a great taker of snuff as well as towns his conduct of the clouded cane gives him the honor which is so justly his due of an exact conduct in battle which is figured by his truncheon the ensign of a general his earnest eye or the vivacity of his look is so particularly remarkable in him that this character could be mistaken for no other had not this author purposely obscured it by the fictitious circumstance of a round unthinking face  having now explained the chief characters of his human persons for there are some others that will hereafter fall in by the by in the sequel of this discourse i shall next take in pieces his machinary wherein his satyr is wholly confined to ministers of state  the sylphs and gnomes at first sight appeared to me to signify the two contending parties of this nation for these being placed in the air and those on the earth i thought agreed very well with the common denomination high and low but as they are made to be the first movers and influencers of all that happens it is plain they represent promiseuously the heads of parties whom he makes to be the authors of all those changes in the state which are generally imputed to the levity and instability of the british nation this erring mortals levity may call oh blind to truth the sylphs contrive it all but of this he has given us a plain demonstration for speaking of these spirits he says in express terms  the chief the care of nations own and guard with arms divine the british throne   and here let it not seem odd if in this mysterious way of writing we find the same person who has before been represented by the baron again described in the character of ariel it being a common way with authors in this fabulous manner to take such a liberty as for instance i have read in the english st evremont that all the different characters in petronius are but nero in so many different appearances and in the key to the curious romance of barclays argenis that both poliarchus and archombrotus mean only the king of navarre  we observe in the very beginning of the poem that ariel is possessed of the ear of belinda therefore it is absolutely necessary that this person must be the minister who was nearest the queen but whoever would be further convinced that he meant the late tr may know him by his ensigns in the following line he raised his azure wand    his sitting on the mast of a vessel shows his presiding over the sth sa trde when ariel assigns to his sylphs all the posts about belinda what is more clearly described than the trrs disposing all the places of the kingdom and particularly about her may but let us hear the lines  ye spirits to your charge repair the fluttering fan be zephyrettas care the drops to thee brillante we consign and momentilla let the watch be thine do thou crispissa tend her favorite lock he has here particularized the ladies and women of the bedchamber the keeper of the cabinet and her mys dresser and impudently given nicknames to each  to put this matter beyond all dispute the sylphs are said to be wondrous fond of place in the canto following where ariel is perched uppermost and all the rest take their places subordinately under him  here again i cannot but observe the excessive malignity of this author who could not leave this character of ariel without the same invidious stroke which he gave him in the character of the baron before amazed confused he saw his power expired resigned to fate and with a sigh retired being another prophecy that he should resign his place which it is probable all ministers do with a sigh  at the head of the gnomes he sets vmbriel a dusky melancholy spright who makes it his business to give belinda the spleen a vile and malicious suggestion against some grave and worthy minister the vapors fantoms visions and the like are the jealousies fears and cries of danger that have so often affrighted and alarmed the nation those who are described in the house of spleen under those several fantastical forms are the same whom their illwillers have so often called the whimsical  the two foregoing spirits being the only considerable characters of the machinary i shall but just mention the sylph that is wounded with the scissars at the loss of the lock by whom is undoubtedly understood my ld tod who at that time received a wound in his character for making the barrier treaty and was cut out of his employment upon the dissolution of it but that spirit reunites and receives no harm to signify that it came to nothing and his lrdshp had no real hurt by it  but i must not conclude this head of the characters without observing that our author has run through every stage of beings in search of topics for detraction and as he has characterized some persons under angels and men so he has others under animals and things inanimate he has represented an eminent clergyman as a dog and a noted writer as a tool let us examine the former  but shock who thought she slept too long leapt up and waked his mistress with his tongue it was then belinda if report say true thy eyes first opened on a billetdoux by this shock it is manifest he has most audatiously and profanely reflected on dr sachll who leapt up that is into the pulpit and awakened great britain with his tongue that is with his sermon which made so much noise and for which he has frequently been termed by others of his enemies as well as by this author a dog or perhaps by his tongue may be more literally meant his speech at his trial since immediately thereupon our author says her eyes opened on a billetdoux billetsdoux being addresles to ladies from lovers may be aptly interpreted those addresses of loving subjects to her may which ensued that trial  the other instance is at the end of the third canto steel did the labors of the gods destroy and strike to dust the imperial towers of troy steel could the works of mortal pride confound and hew triumphal arches to the ground   here he most impudently attributes the demolition of dunkirk not to the pleasure of her may or her ministry but to the frequent instigations of his friend mr steel a very artful pun to conceal his wicked lampoonery  having now considered the general intent and scope of the poem and opened the characters i shall next discover the malice which is covered under the episodes and particular passages of it  the game at ombre is a mystical representation of the late war which is hinted by his making spades the trump spade in spanish signifying a sword and being yet so painted in the cards of that nation to which it is well known we owe the original of our cards in this one place indeed he has unawares paid a compliment to the queen and her success in the war for belinda gets the better of the two that play against her the kings of france and spain  i do not question but every particular card has its person and character assigned which no doubt the author has told his friends in private but i shall only instance in the description of the disgrace under which the d of mough then suffered which is so apparent in these verses even mighty pam that kings and queens oerthrew and mowed down armies in the fights of lu sad chance of war now destitute of aid falls undistinguished    that the author here had an eye to our modern transactions is very plain from an unguarded stroke toward the end of this game and now as often in some distempered state on one nice trick depends the general fate   after the conclusion of the war the public rejoicings and thanksgivings are ridiculed in the two following lines the nymph exalting fills with shouts the sky the walls the woods and long canals reply immediately upon which there follows a malicious insinuation in the manner of a prophecy which we have formerly observed this seditious writer delights in that the peace should continue but a short time and that the day should afterward be cursed which was then celebrated with so much joy sudden these honors shall be snatched away and cursed for ever this victorious day   as the game at ombre is a satirical representation of the late war so is the teatable that ensues of the council table and its consultations after the peace by this he would hint that all the advantages we have gained by our late extended commerce are only coffee and tea or things of no greater value that he thought of the trade in this place appears by the passage where he represents the sylphs particularly careful of the rich brocade it having been a frequent complaint of our mercers that french brocades were imported in too great quantities i will not say he means those presents of rich gold stuff suits which were said to be made her may by the k of f though i cannot but suspect that he glances at it  here this author as well as the scandalous john dunton represents the miry in plain terms taking frequent cups and frequent cups prolong the rich repast   upon the whole it is manifest he meant something more than common coffee by his calling it coffee that makes the politician wise and by telling us it was this coffee that sent up in vapors to the barons brain new stratagems  i shall only further observe that twas at this table the lock was cut off for where but at the council board should the barrier treaty be dissolved  the ensuing contentions of the parties upon the loss of that treaty are described in the squabbles following the rape of the lock and this he rashly expresses without any disguise in the words all side in parties  here first you have a gentleman who sinks beside his chair a plain allusion to a noble lord who lost his chair of prent of the col  i come next to the bodkin so dreadful in the hand of belinda by which he intimates the british scepter so revered in the hand of our late august princess his own note upon this place tells us he alludes to a scepter and the verses are so plain they need no remark the same his ancient personage to deck her great great grandsire wore about his neck in three seal rings which after melted down formed a vast buckle for his widows gown her infant grandames whistle next it grew the bells she gingled and the whistle blew then in a bodkin graced her mothers hairs which long she wore and now belinda wears   an open satyr upon hereditary right the three seal rings plainly allude to the three kingdoms  these are the chief passages in the battle by which as has before been said he means the squabble of parties upon this occasion he could not end the description of them without testifying his malignant joy at those dissentions from which he forms the prospect that both should be disappointed and cries out with triumph as if it were already accomplished behold how often ambitious arms are crossed and chiefs contend till all the prize is lost   the lock at length is turned into a star or the old barrier treaty into a new and glorious peace this no doubt is what the author at the time he printed his poem would have been thought to mean in hopes by that complement to escape punishment for the rest of his piece it puts me in mind of a fellow who concluded a bitter lampoon upon the prince and court of his days with these lines god save the king the commons and the peers and grant the author long may wear his ears   whatever this author may think of that peace i imagine it the most extraordinary star that ever appeared in our hemisphere a star that is to bring us all the wealth and gold of the indies and from whose influence not mr john partridge alone whose worthy labors this writer so ungenerously ridicules but all true britains may with no less authority than he prognosticate the fall of lewis in the restraint of the exorbitant power of france and the fate of rome in the triumphant condition of the church of england  we have now considered this poem in its political view wherein we have shown that it has two different walks of satyr the one in the story it self which is a ridicule on the late transactions in general the other in the machinary which is a satyr on the ministers of state in particular i shall now show that the same poem taken in another light has a tendency to popery which is secretly insinuated through the whole  in the first place he has conveyed to us the doctrine of guardian angels and patron saints in the machinary of his sylphs which being a piece of popish superstition that has been endeavored to be exploded ever since the reformation he would here revive under this disguise here are all the particulars which they believe of those beings which i shall sum up in a few heads    st the spirits are made to concern themselves with all human acts in general    dly a distinct guardian spirit or patron is assigned to each person in particular of these am i who thy protection claim a watchful sprite      dly they are made directly to inspire dreams visions and revelations her guardian sylph prolonged her balmy rest twas he had summoned to her silent bed the morning dream      thly they are made to be subordinate in different degrees some presiding over others so ariel has his several underofficers at command superior by the head was ariel placed     thly they are employed in various offices and each has his office assigned him some in the fields of purest ether play and bask and whiten in the blaze of duy some guide the course etc     thly he has given his spirits the charge of the several parts of dress intimating thereby that the saints preside over the several parts of human bodies they have one saint to cure the toothache another cures the gripes another the gout and so of all the rest the fluttering fan be zephyrettas care the drops to thee brillante we consign etc     thly they are represented to know the thoughts of men as on the nosegay in her breast reclined he watched the ideas rising in her mind     thly they are made protectors even to animals and irrational beings ariel himself shall be the guard of shock so st anthony presides over hogs etc    thly others are made patrons of whole kingdoms and provinces of these the chief the care of nations own so st george is imagined by the papists to defend england st patrick ireland st james spain etc now what is the consequence of all this by granting that they have this power we must be brought back again to pray to them  the toilette is an artful recommendation of the mass and pompous ceremonies of the church of rome the unveiling of the altar the silver vases upon it being robbed in white as the priests are upon the chief festivals and the head uncovered are manifest marks of this a heavenly image in the glass appears to that she bends  plainly denotes image worship  the goddess who is decked with treasures jewels and the various offerings of the world manifestly alludes to the lady of loretto you have perfumes breathing from the incense pot in the following line and all arabia breaths from yonder box   the character of belinda as we take it in this third view represents the popish religion or the whore of babylon who is described in the state this malevolent author wishes for coming forth in all her glory upon the thames and overspreading the nation with ceremonies not with more glories in thaetherial plain the sun first rises over the purple main than issuing forth the rival of his beams launched on the bosom of the silver thames   she is dressed with a cross on her breast the ensign of popery the adoration of which is plainly recommended in the following lines on her white breast a sparkling cross she wore which jews might kiss and infidels adore   next he represents her as the universal church according to the boasts of the papists and like the sun she shines on all alike after which he tells us if to her share some female errors fall look on her face and you will forget them all though it should be granted some errors fall to her share look on the pompous figure she makes throughout the world and they are not worth regarding in the sacrifice following soon after you have these two lines for this ever phoebus rose he had implored propitious heaven and every power adored in the first of them he plainly hints at their matins in the second by adoring every power the invocation of saints  belindas visits are described with numerous waxlights which are always used in the ceremonial parts of the romish worship  visits shall be paid on solemn days when numerous waxlights in bright order blaze   the lunar sphere he mentions opens to us their purgatory which is seen in the following line since all things lost on earth are treasured there it is a popish doctrine that scarce any person quits this world but he must touch at purgatory in his way to heaven and it is here also represented as the treasury of the romish church nor is it much to be wondered at that the moon should be purgatory when a learned divine has in a late treatise proved hell to be in the sun the reverend dr swinden   i shall now before i conclude desire the reader to compare this key with those upon any other pieces which are supposed to be secret satyrs upon the state either ancient or modern as with those upon petronius arbiter lucians true history barclays argenis or rablaiss garagantua and i doubt not he will do me the justice to acknowledge that the explanations here laid down are deduced as naturally and with as little force both from the general scope and bent of the work and from the several particulars and are every way as consistent and undeniable as any of those and every way as candid as any modern interpretations of either party on the mysterious state treatises of our times  to sum up my whole charge against this author in a few words he has ridiculed both the present miry and the last abused great statesmen and great generals nay the treaties of whole nations have not escaped him nor has the royal dignity it self been omitted in the progress of his satyr and all this he has done just at the meeting of a new parliament i hope a proper authority may be made use of to bring him to condign punishment in the mean while i doubt not if the persons most concerned would but order mr bernard lintott the printer and publisher of this dangerous piece to be taken into custody and examined many further discoveries might be made both of this poets and his abettors secret designs which are doubtless of the utmost importance to the government  finis
