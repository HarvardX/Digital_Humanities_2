the hermit a poem now taught by this confess the almighty just and where thou cannot unravel learn to trust  far in a wild remote from public view from youth to age a reverend hermit grew the moss his bed the cave his humble cell his food the fruits his drink the crystal well unknown to man with god he passed the days prayer all his business all his pleasure praise a life so sacred such serene repose seemed heaven itself till one suggestion rose that vice should triumph virtue vice obey hence sprung some doubts of providences sway his hopes no more a certain prospect boast and all the tenor of his soul is lost to clear this doubt to know the world by sight to find if books or swains report it right he with the sun a rising journey went sedate to think and watching each event the morn was wasted in the pathless grass and long and lonesome was the wild to pass but when the southern sun had warmed the day a youth came posting over a crossing way his raiment decent his complexion fair and soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair then near approaching father hail he cried and hail my son the reverend sire replied words followed words from questions answers flowed and talk of various kind deceived the road till each with other pleased and loath to part while in their age they differ join in heart thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around now sunk the sun the closing hour of day came onward mantled over with sober gray nature in silence bid the world repose when near the road a stately palace rose it chanced the generous master of the dome still made his house the wandering strangers home yet still the kindness from a thirst of praise proved the vain flourish of expensive ease the pair arrive the livryd servants wait their lord receives them at the pompous gate the table groans with costly piles of food and all is more than hospitable good then led to rest the days long toil they drown deep sunk in sleep and silk and heaps of down at length it is morn and at the dawn of day along the wide canals the zephyrs play up rise the guests obedient to the call an early banquet decked the splendid hall rich luscious wine a golden vessel graced which the kind master forced the guests to taste then pleased and thankful from the porch they go and but the landlord none had cause of woe his cup was vanished for in secret guise the younger guest purloind the glittering prize as one who spies a serpent in his way glistning and basking in the summers ray disordered stops to shun the danger near then walks with faintness on and looks with fear so seemed the sire when far upon the road the shining spoil his wiley partner showed he stopped with silence walked with trembling heart and much he wished but durst not ask to part murmuring he lifts his eyes and thinks it hard that generous actions meet a base reward while thus they pass the sun his glory shrouds the changing skies hang out their sable clouds a sound in air presaged approaching rain and beasts to covert scud across the plain warned by the signs the wandering pair retreat to seek for shelter at a neighboring seat twas built with turrets on a rising ground and strong and large and unimprovd around its owners temper timorous and severe unkind and griping caused a desert there as near the misers heavy doors they drew fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew the nimble lightning mixed with showers began and over their heads loud rolling thunder ran here long they knock but knock or call in vain driven by the wind and battered by the rain at length some pity warmed the masters breast twas then his threshold first received a guest slow creaking turns the door with jealous care and half he welcomes in the shivering pair one frugal faggot lights the naked walls and naturs fervor through their limbs recalls bread of the coarsest sort with eager wine each hardly granted served them both to dine and when the tempest first appeared to cease a ready warning bid them part in peace with still remark the pondring hermit viewed in one so rich a life so poor and rude and why should such within himself he cried lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside but what new marks of wonder soon took place in every settling feature of his face when from his vest the young companion bore that cup the generous landlord owned before and paid profusely with the precious bowl the stinted kindness of this churlish soul but now the clouds in airy tumult fly the sun emerging opes an azure sky a fresher green the smelling leaves display and glittering as they tremble cheer the day the weather courts them from the poor retreat and the glad master bolts the wary gate while hence they walk the pilgrims bosom wrought with all the travel of uncertain thought his partners acts without their cause appear twas there a vice and seemed a madness here detesting that and pitying this he goes lost and confounded with the various shows now nights dim shades involve the azure sky again they search and find a lodging nigh the soil improved around the mansion neat and neither poorly low nor idly great it seemed to speak its masters turn of mind content and not for praise but virtue kind hither the walkers turn with weary feet then bless the mansion and the master greet their greeting fair bestowed with modest guise the courteous master hears and thus replies without a vain without a grudging heart to him who gives us all i yield a part from him you come for him accept it here a frank and sober more than costly cheer he spoke and bid the welcome table spread then talked of virtue till the time of bed when the grave household round his hall repair warned by a bell and close the hours with prayer at length the world renewed by calm repose was strong for toil the dappled morn arose before the pilgrims part the younger crept near the closed cradle where an infant slept and writhed his neck the landlords little pride o strange return grew black and gasped and died horror of horrors what his only son how looked our hermit when the fact was done not hell though hells black jaws in sunder part and breathe blue fire could more assault his heart confused and struck with silence at the deed he flies but trembling fails to fly with speed his steps the youth pursues the country lay perplexed with roads a servant showed the way a river crossed the path the passage over was nice to find the servant trod before long arms of oaks an open bridge supplied and deep the waves beneath them bending glide the youth who seemed to watch a time to sin approached the careless guide and thrust him in plunging he falls and rising lifts his head then flashing turns and sinks among the dead wild sparkling rage inflames the fathers eyes he bursts the bands of fear and madly cries detested wretch  but scarce his speech began when the strange partner seemed no longer man his youthful face grew more serenely sweet his robe turned white and flowed upon his feet fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair celestial odours breathed through purple air the form etherial bursts upon his sight and moves in all the majesty of light though loud at first the pilgrims passion grew sudden he gazed and wist not what to do surprise in secret chains his words suspends and in a calm his settling temper ends but silence here the beauteous angel broke the voice of music ravished as he spoke thy prayer thy praise thy life to vice unknown in sweet memorial rise before the throne these charms success in our bright region find and force an angel down to calm thy mind for this commissioned i forsook the sky nay cease to kneel  thy fellow servants i then know the truth of government divine and let these scruples be no longer thine the maker justly claims that world he made in this the right of providence is laid its sacred majesty through all depends on using second means to work his ends it is thus withdrawn in state from human eye the power exerts his attributes on high your actions uses nor controuls your will and bids the doubting sons of men be still what strange events can strike with more surprise than those which lately struck thy wandering eyes yet taught by these confess the almighty just and where thou cannot unriddle learn to trust the great vain man who fared on costly food whose life was too luxurious to be good who made his ivory stands with goblets shine and forced his guests to morning draughts of wine has with the cup the graceless custom lost and still he welcoms but with less of cost the mean suspicious wretch whose bolted door never moved in duty to the wandering poor with him i left the cup to teach his mind that heaven can bless if mortals will be kind conscious of wanting worth he views the bowl and feels compassion touch his grateful soul thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead with heaping coals of fire upon its head in the kind warmth the metal learns to glow and loose from dross the silver runs below long had our pious friend in virtue trod but now this child half weaned his heart from god child of his age for him he lived in pain and measured back his steps to earth again to great excesses had his dotage run but god to save the father took the son to all but thee in fits he seemed to go and twas my ministry to deal the blow the poor fond parent humbled in the dust now owns in tears the punishment is just but how had all his fortune felt a wreck had that false servant sped in safety back this night his treasured heaps he meant to steal and what a fund of charity would fail thus heaven instructs thy mind this trial over depart in peace resign and sin no more on sounding pinions here the youth withdrew the sage stood wondering as the seraph flew thus looked elisha when to mount on high his master took the chariot of the sky the fiery pomp ascending left the view the prophet gazed and wished to follow too the hermit bending here a prayer begun lord as in heaven on earth thy will be done then gladly turning sought his ancient place and passed a life of piety and peace the inspiration of god and the clear information of the holy scriptures assures us that god reserves his choicest secrets for the purest minds and that its uncleaness of spirit not difference of method in seeking after god that separates us from him true holiness being the only safe entrance into divine knowledge the apostle peter declares act  0    that he perceived of a truth that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted with him and the apostle paul also tells the galatians chap      that in christ jesus neither circumcission avails any thing nor uncircumcission but a new creature notwithstanding the clearness of these and many more such doctrines contained in the scriptures selfishness and partiality those inhuman and base qualities have been suffered to prevail even amongst such as are esteemed the most pious in the several sects and parties of the christian church they have raised and still raise in every communion a selfish partial orthodoxy which consists in courageously defending all its opinions and practices and condemning the doctrines and practices of others and thus every one is trained up in defense of their own church their own truth their own opinion and he often is judged to have the most merit and the most honor who likes every thing and defends every thing amongst themselves and leaves nothing uncensured in those that are of a different communion now how can truth goodness and religion be more struck at than by such defenders of it if you ask why the great bishop of meaux wrote so many learned books against all parts of the reformation it is because he was born in france had he been born in england had he been bred at oxford or cambridge he might have rivalld our great bishop stilling fleet and would have wrote as many learned folios against the church of rome as he has done and yet i will venture to say that if each church could produce but one man a piece that had the piety of an apostle and the impartial love of the first christians they would not want half a sheet of paper to hold their articles of union nor be half an hour before they were of one religion if we loved truth as such if we sought it for its own sake if we loved our neighbors as our selves if we desired nothing by our religion but to be acceptable to god if we equally desired the salvation of all men if we were afraid of error only because of its hurtful nature to us and our brethren of other communions then nothing of this spirit could have any place in us for god is love and they which dwell in god they dwell in love   john      that universal love which gives the whole strength of the heart to god and which makes us love every man as we love ourselves is the noblest the most divine and godlike state of the soul and is the utmost perfection to which the most perfect religion can raise us and no religion does any man any good but so far as it brings this perfect love with it perfection can no where be found but in a pure disinterested love of god and our neighbor there is therefore a communion of saints in the love of god which no one can learn from that which is called orthodoxy in the different sects but is only to be had by a total dying to all worldly views by a pure love of god and by such an unction from above as delivers the mind from all selfishness and makes it love truth and goodness with an equality of affection in every man let his name and profession to religion be what it may and by thus uniting in heart and spirit with all that is holy and good in all professions we enter into the true communion of saints and become real members of the true universal christian church though we are confined to the outward worship of only one particular part of it it is thus that the angels as ministering spirits assist join unite and cooperate with every thing that is holy and good in every division of mankind he that has been all his life long used to look with great slight upon those of other professions whom he has called superstitious biggots dreaming visionaries canting enthusiasts etc must naturally expect they will be treated by god as they have been by him and if he had the keys of the kingdom of heaven such people would find it hard to get a place in it but it stands greatly in hand to get rid of this temper before we dye for if nothing but universal love can enter into the kingdom of god what can be more necessary for us than to be full of this love before we dye  we often hear of people of great zeal and orthodoxy declaring on their deathbeds their strict attachment to the church of england and making solemn protestations against all other churches but how much better would it be if such a person was to say in this divided state of christendom i must conform to some outward divided part of it and therefore i have chosen to live and dye in outward communion with the church of england fully believing that if i worship god in spirit and in truth in this divided part of the church i shall be as acceptable to him as if i had been a faithful member of the one whole church before it was broken into separate parts but as i am now going out of this disordered division into a more universal state of things as i am going to the god of all churches to a kingdom of universal love which must have its inhabitants from all people nations and languages of the earth so in this spirit of universal love i desire to perform my last act of communion in this divided church uniting and joining in heart and spirit with all that is christian holy good and acceptable to god in all other churches praying from the bottom of my soul that every church may have its saints that gods kingdom may come his will be done in every division of christians and men and that every thing that has breath may praise the lord  the humble meek merciful just pious and devout souls are every where of one religion and when death has taken off the mask they will know one another though the diverse liveries they wear here makes them strangers let us choose to commune where there is the warmest sense of religion where devotion exceeds formality and practice most corresponds with profession and where there is at least as much charity as zeal for where this society is to be found there shall we find the church of god willam penns refl and max an eminent servant of god who had known deliverance from the dark powers and experimentally felt the powers of the world to come a few hours before his death expressed himself in the following words there is a spirit which i feel that delights to do no evil nor to revenge any wrong but delights to endure all things in hopes to enjoy its own in the end its hope is to outlive all wrath and contention and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty or whatsoever is of a nature contrary to itself it sees to the end of all temptations as it bears no evil in it self so it conceives none in thought to any other for its ground and spring is the mercies and forgiveness of god its crown is meekness its life is everlasting love unfeigned and takes its kingdom with entreaty and not with contention and keeps it by lowliness of mind in god alone it can rejoice though none else regard it or can own its life it is conceived in sorrow and brought forth without any to pity it nor does it murmur at grief and oppression it never rejoiceth but through sufferings for with the worlds joy it is murdered i found it alone being forsaken i have fellowship therein with them that lived in dens and desolate places of the earth who through death obtained resurrection and eternal holy life
