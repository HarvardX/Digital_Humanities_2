for publishing periodically a collection of mathematical and philosophical tracts and selections the utility of a work of this kind will appear evident in reflecting that a multitude of valuable tracts both mathematical and philosophical are interspersed among voluminous collections and expensive publications and are otherwise inaccessible to the generality of readers  to collect and preserve such tracts to compress them into a small compass and to arrange them in a convenient form are the objects of the editors of the publication which is now offered to the patronage and encouragement of the scientific world  it is not intended to confine the selection to english works but occasionally to translate those in other languages which appear to deserve places in this collection  the editors propose to publish a volume annually or oftener if it be found necessary and they meet with sufficient encouragement to contain portions of several valuable tracts each paged separately so that when complete they may be bound in distinct volumes or in any manner the purchaser may think proper a part of each volume will also be reserved for the insertion of shorter extracts and original communications which in time will form a valuable miscellaneous volume  having briefly stated the outlines of their plan the editors presume to think that the execution of it will be attended with considerable service to the public and to science and in order to render it as perfect as possible they will thankfully receive any hints for its improvement addressed postpaid to mr glendinning

hattongarden mr o gregory bookseller cambridge and mr bulmer sunderland of whom may be had any of the former numbers or by applying to any of the booksellers  address the editor is sorry to be again under the necessity of apologizing for the late appearance of his publication he is confident however of having his apology accepted when he assures his readers that the delay was occasioned by circumstances which he was unable to prevent and that measures have been taken which it is hoped will ensure the regular appearance of each number in future one of these is a determination to prepare the copy for the press immediately after the limited time is expired without waiting for any further communications while therefore the editor returns his most grateful thanks to his kind contributors for their assistance and support he begs leave to entreat that they will send their favors early and he trusts the smallest reflection will convince them of the propriety of the restriction he has adopted  the editor has not continued mr wallaces paper on porisms because it is intended for insertion in a collection of mathematical and philosophical tracts and selections proposals for publishing which accompany this number  it is intended in each succeeding number to insert accounts of new mathematical and philosophical publications and short biographical notices of eminent mathematicians and philosophers recently deceased impartial and authentic communications for these articles will always be thankfully received  the editor will be much obliged to those gentlemen who favor him with new questions as much as possible to compose such as will be of real utility in the various branches and will generally admit of neat accurate and satisfactory answers he has also to request that such of his correspondents as send him solutions will be at the trouble to work them throughout and give the result as well as the method of solution this would undoubtedly give more satisfaction to the readers of the repository and at the same time add to the reputation of its ingenious contributors  the gentleman who supposes himself alluded to in one of the replies to mr jogglebellys essay on negroes would have had his letter inserted had he not descended to such low and vulgar language as would have disgraced the repository it is hoped he will on reconsidering his letter acquiesce in this opinion and that he will also on further delibration think the editor has acted with propriety in not publishing his very violent remarks on an individual whom he can assure him he has in this case unjustly accused to the first of these objections the letter of l m on the same subject is also liable and on that account is inadmissible the editor wishes by all means to encourage fair and liberal discussion but he can never consent to make his work the vehicle of scurrility and abuse instead of argument and candor  librus of walton is informed in answer to his enquiry concerning mr gregorys lessons astronomical and philosophical that the editor has not been able to procure him a copy but he has since heard that a new edition of that useful performance enlarged and improved is just published by mr conder no  0 buckersbury london  mr keiths trigonometry is now in the press and will soon appear  a silver medal will be determined by lot as before among three of the best answerers to each of the prize questions  on account of the late appearance of this number is is proposed to delay the publication of number ix until the first of may   00 and to extend the time for receiving communications to the   th of january all letters received after that time will positively be too late for insertion in that number  number x will be ready on the first of november   00 and all letters intended for its use must come to hand by the   th of july or they will be too late  new editions of numbers i and ii will be published speedily  communications postpaid addressed either to mr
