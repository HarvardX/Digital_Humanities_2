a short treatise on onanism or the detestable vice of selfpollution  describing the variety of nervous and other disorders that are occasioned by that shameful practice or too early and excessive venery and directing the best method for their cure  quippe nec ira duem tantum nee tela nec hosts quantum sola noces animis illapsa voluptas silius italicus by a physician in the country  the second edition  london printed and sold by fletcher and co booksellers at the oxfordtheatre the northside of st pauls churchyard       a short treatise on onanism physicians are agreed that copulation when age adult and highbracd nerves invite should neither be immoderately desired nor dreaded to excess the good old man is by his tame frigidity admonished not to engage in the dull drudgery mistaken for enchanting scenes of pleasure lest thus he snap his feeble thread of life but what more base more noxious to the body than by the power of fancy to excite such lewd ideas of an absent object as rouse the organs formed for nobler ends to rush into the embraces of a phantom and do the deed of personal enjoyment the preface this little treatise was at first not intended to be published separate but only to be annexed to another work of the authors printed at the same time entitled observations on specific medicines etc but as many may have an occasion to peruse this part without the other who would not care to be at the expense of purchasing both together a few copies were printed off separate for this reason  all the merit which the author pretends to in this as well as in the other treatise is his having offered to mankind the means for relief established upon reiterated experience the most infallible foundation for the science of physic which will scarce ever fail of giving satisfaction to the miserable patient especially if the rules and directions prescribed and given with the medicines herein recommended are strictly adhered to  in long protracted and obstinate cases which will not easily yield to the general method of cure herein mentioned the author desires to be consulted either in person or by letter he requests those who send their cases to be very particular with respect to the symptoms of their indisposition length of time they have been afflicted what means they have already used and likewise their age present degree of strength constitution habit of body etc and all letters postpaid directed to him to be left at mr fletchers and co booksellers at the oxfordtheatre on the northside of st pauls church yard shall have due attention paid them and be answered with all the speed that the distance of place will admit of  london nov      w farrer  a short treatise on onanism mastupratio or manustupratio manual stupration or selfpollution is a vice hardly to be named much less to be practiced in a country where virtue decency or politeness have the least regard paid to them and this abominable and unmanly practice is productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders  providence has implanted in human nature what is by some called the passion of love and by others the appetite of lust for very wise purposes but has given us reason to restrain this necessary inclination and keep it within due limits every day however furnishes us with cases which evince that reason is not always a balance against the appetites for boys regardless or perhaps ignorant of the consequences too frequently indulge themselves in this preposterous method of venery and it is beyond a doubt that many more advanced in years who are long immured in colleges and cloisters and at last elope from their cells utterly destitute of science and equally unacquainted with the world and books are not less guilty of this enormous vice  these by a most detestable kind of magic conjure up at pleasure an ideal venus and thus never want an opportunity of enjoying an imaginary mistress the frequent repetition of these execrable pleasures induce an infinitude of the worst disorders such as lethargies vertigos atrophys apoplexies palsies lowness of spirits hypochondriacal disorders amauroses a tabes dorsalis and the worst species of a gonorrhaea most commonly attended with an utter impotence as to real enjoyments besides an innumerable train of various nervous complaints such as are the frequent attendants upon a declining age when the vigor of youth begins to wear off  these disorders chiefly derive their origin from those universal convulsions that always attend the emission of the semen and if we consider the human body as made up of flexible pipes and yielding fluids we shall readily understand how convulsions wear out the constitution and produce these effects viz by destroying the strength and elasticity of the solid parts and that the extacy which accompanies venereal enjoyments is of the nature of a convulsion is not hard to be conceived quincy in his explanation of sanctoriuss aphorisms expressly says that at the time of coition the fibers are intensely drawn up that too frequent use of this exercise cannot but be very prejudicial to health by overstraining and destroying the force of the fibers sect iv aphorism i  the natural consequence of which must be a springyness and action upon their contents hence perspiration is lessened mala a nimio coitu orta mediate a perspiratione sanctor sect vi aphorism iii the fluids run into preternatural cohesions and obstructions are generated and this morbid condition is still augmented by an excessive loss of the semen itself since the blood is thereby robbed of its most pure balsamic and invigorating particles  besides it is worthy of remark that people who are accustomed to such filthiness are not so easily cured of any chronical distemper as those who are free from it for as celsus speaking about venereal intercourses prudently remarks cavendumne in secunda valetudine adversae presidia consumantur that is we should take care of consuming wantonly in a state of health what would be our support during sickness  the semen verile is a fluid of the most elaborate and noble production in the whole body except that of the nerves if such there be and it is this vital feed which makes men hot robust hairy of a strong and deep voice bold and courageous and fit to contrive or execute any enterprise men are a proof of this whereas they who are destitute of vital seed are wrinkled pale weak of a shrill voice without hair beardless and effeminate such are eunuchs for we know from experience when the secretory organs of this juice are destroyed by castration before the time of puberty as is frequently done in italy to preserve the voice or if by any accident a man is deprived of his testicles after this age the destruction of these marks of verility also follow in confirmation of this boerhaave has given us an instance of fact there was says he an intrepid soldier who aspiring after the reward proposed by the general to him who would first fix the standard in the enemies fort climbed through the thick battery of the enemy but unfortunately the fire of a cannon took off both his testicles yet he recovered and became at length effeminate not in mind but in body the strength of the several muscles of the genital parts still continued and nothing toward his virility but his testicles and yet his voice soon altered and beard fell off etc but the man who is retentive of the seminal juices becomes bold hardy and strong like the beasts of the forest witness the athletae of old who led chaste lives  therefore as the semen is as it were the flower and choicest part of the blood and nervous fluid so venery ought to be only moderately used lest too great an evacuation of this substance prove prejudicial to health a frequent ejection of the semen requires a sound and vigorous habit of body because it exhausts the strength and weakens the person hence pythagoras when asked when coition was to be used wisely answered when you have an inclination to render yourself weaker  as venery then only agrees with persons of robust and vigorous constitutions so the use of it is principally beneficial to health after the stomach is empty and perspiration duly performed especially if the person has slept well and taken aliments of a nutritive quality and easy digestion all these things are of such a nature as to increase the strength and vigor of the body and consequently to favor venery or at least prevent the bad effects it would otherwise have it is also to be observed that it is more salutary in spring than at any other season of the year  the person who would often engage in venery ought to guard against all surfeits hunger labors excessive studies venesections watchings purges and every thing which can in the least impair and destroy the strength  celsus observes  that we ought not too eagerly to pursue or too sollicitously to avoid intercourses with the tender sex pleasures of this kind rarely indulged render the body alert and active but if too frequently repeated weak languid and inactive and as the proper degree of these pleasures is not to be estimated by the number of repetitions but by the constitution the age and the strength of the person so we may take it for granted with respect to this particular that the enjoyment which is neither followed by weakness nor succeeded by pain is not prejudicial  the day is the worst season for pleasures of this kind especially if they are succeeded by a full meal the night is less hazardous but even then subsequent fatigue with long watching render it improper it is also to be abstained from in summer because at that time it is subject to throw the humors into preternatural commotions  but as moderation in every thing contributes to health so likewise does temperate venery and every one ought carefully to consider what his constitution can bear for a very robust person may safely indulge himself in a degree of venery which would remarkably weaken one of a worse constitution  persons of a tender and delicate habit of body and weak crasis of blood and spirits should by no means indulge themselves in venereal engagements without great moderation and caution those who are either too young or too old and those who are lately recovered from a disease ought also to abstain from venery lest they bring on too great a relaxation of the nerves and by overstraining the fibers that compose all the parts of their bodies injure and weaken their several functions in the animal system and become liable to all those disorders that have been already mentioned  thus they who by nature were stronger than others have by intemperance rendered themselves much weaker than those who were naturally weak and those who were much weaker by nature have by their temperance become superior in strength to those who were stronger for nothing renders an animal robust but the seminal juice which is therefore of great efficacy and importance toward health strength and magnanimity as well as procreation  but as there are too many who do not attend to the rules here laid down so much as would be convenient for them perhaps the following case may be of some importance to such as have not yet utterly destroyed their constitutions by an immoderate pursuit after pleasures  a young man of twentyfive years of age of a phlegmaticosanguine habit and who from his very infancy had a tender constitution when about fifteen years of age learnt of a wicked schoolfellow the execrable trick of mastupration he indulged himself in this vile and unmanly practice very frequently even almost daily from the fifteenth to the twentythird year of his age and applied himself at the same time to writing in a very small character by which means he contracted such an excessive weakness of his head and eyes that these latter were frequently convulsed during his preposterous entertainment  some time ago while he was wickedly employed in this manner and his design upon the very point of being executed some person or other unexpectedly knocked at his chamber door which accident put him into such confusion that the ultimate scene of his diversion was left unaccomplished upon this he immediately felt so exquisite a pain and so vehement a tension in his testicles and spermatic vessels that he could not walk without the utmost difficulty the force of his genius and the sight of his eyes seemed at the same time to be diminished and impaired  though he had the danger with which this execrable practice threataned him in full view yet after the pain of his testicles was removed he was so much infatuated as to repeat his crime and begin afresh his former course but he was soon after seized with the like pain in his genitals and especially in his testicles where the pain was accompanied with a very considerable tension by the use of external and internal medicines for about half a year he also got this disorder removed but with some difficulty  soon after he was seized with a swelling in those vessels which go to the left testicle the swelling appeared larger than ordinary after his meals but was not accompanied with pain unless when by his folly he brought a stimulus on the parts but though it was void of pain it was attended with another very unlucky circumstance for it remains with him to this very day to this was joined so great a weakin his head and eyes that when he was about to read any thing he seemed to be drunk and flushed with wine the pupils of his eyes were extremely dilated and his eyes themselves racked with darting pains accompanied with some degree of tension his eyelids seemed as it were oppressed with a kind of weight in the morning they were conglutinated together and watered very much but this was not all for both corners of his eyes besides the violent pains with which they were racked were also clogged and stuffed with a whitish kind of matter  in this deplorable state he was obliged to give over reading and interrupt the course of his studies for the space of six months during which time he only employed himself in exercise and recreation and in taking the medicines which were judged proper for one in his condition by which means he recovered so far as to be able to apply himself to his studies for two or three hours a day which he can still do but if at any time he should chance to protract his application and lengthen out his studies beyond their stated time he is immediately seized with the above symptoms besides he was become so lean that his body was little more than a skeleton and though his appetite was good yet he was indisposed after his meals and was affected with a kind of drunkenness  but when he got a juster sense of things and had for almost the space of two years abstained from his former practices and from all commerce with women he began to be troubled with very frequent nocturnal pollutions by which he found his body gradually more and more weakened and his strength impaired so that now what seemed principally to be regarded was the removal of this imbecility which was after some time entirely cured by the use of my strengthening electuary of which more will be said hereafter  from this account we learn that venery used either too soon or too often not only impairs the strength of the body in general but also debilitates the noble functions of the brain and eyes to such a degree that the loss becomes almost irreparable  i have had an opportunity of seeing a great many cases where persons well advanced in years have by immoderate venery not only brought upon their eyes redness darting pains accompanied with tension a heavy sensation as if a weight was laid upon them and a frequent shedding of tears but likewise such a weakness of sight that they were rendered incapable either to read or write and i have found that in these very cases the pupils were always dilated as they are in a gutta serena by reason of the weakened or lost tone of the muscular and nervous sibres which surround them but why need i stop here since i myself knew two cases in which a gutta serena itself was brought on by excessive venery and a long series of grief  hence it appears how great and surprising a consent there is between the seminal parts or rather the spirituous seminal fluid itself and the fabric of the eye which is composed of the finest membranes nerves and muscular fibers as well as the most clear and transparent fluids  the lymphatic seminal fluid is almost of the same nature and quality with that fluid which is secreted in the brain and distributed through all the nerves of the body for which reason the more plentiful the evacuation of the former is the more scanty and defective the secretion of the other in the brain must of course be hence also a reason may be assigned why those youths who begin too early to taste the forbidden joys of venus sustain a considerable loss of memory and are rendered unfit for study and likewise why persons farther advanced in years who are excessively addicted to venereal pleasure lose their strength and bring on a premature death  the reason of the nocturnal pollutions in the case just recited is very plain for the more copious and frequent the afflux of the humors especially of the seminal matter has been to the organs destined for generation either by the force of imagination or otherwise i say the more frequent and copious such an afflux has been the more the spermatic vessels are dilated and relaxed and the seminal juice for that very reason flows into them in a greater quantity and lays a foundation for those wanton ideas and seminal excretions which even during sleep affect people of a warm imagination  but the most formidable species of this disease is when the retaining vessels are so extremely relaxed as to permit the seminal juices to pass off upon the slightest stimulus as a luscious idea or conversation with a woman after straining at the discharge of the excrements or after riding on horseback in consequence of a relaxation in the night time the same accident happens from venereal dreams with a sensation of enjoyment and this is frequently attended with a continual weeping or gleet which exhausts the strength of the patient  the matter of this flux is an humid thin cold colorless substance called by hippocrates a liquid semen burnet hippocrat contract p     which is void of foecundity for how is it possible that nature thus refrigerated should emit a prolific juice those afflicted with this disorder must of necessity become old in habit of body slow languid dull spiritless silent feeble wrinkled unactive pale effeminate of a weak appetite cold with a heaviness of the limbs and a numbness of the legs weak lazy and indisposed for all manner of action in many subjects this disorder is the forerunner of a palsy but it oftener terminates in that species of a consumption called by physicians tabes dorsalis  a tabes dorsalis is a violent disorder little treated of by physicians though fully described by hippocrates tabes dorsalis ex spinali medulla oritur praecipue vero recentes sponsos and libidinosos corripit febris sunt expertes been comedunt and colliquantur quod sit ita affectum perconteris asseret sibi videri ex superioribus partibus a capite velut formicas in spinam demitti cumque urinam and stercus reddit semen genitale copiosum and liquidum ei prodit neque generatio fit and inter dormiandum cum uxore dormiat necne veneris iudibria patitur cumque alias tum praecipue per locum arduum iter facerit aut cucurrerit anhelosus and imbecilis evadit caput gravatur and aures sonant hic temporis progressu vehementibus febribus correptus perit ex lipyria febre burnet hippocrat contract p      the symptoms which presage this consumption i have for the most part observed to be these an hypochondriacal oppression melancholy and too much thoughtfulness pain in the back and often in the head an aching pain rolling and hanging down of the testicles a weakness of memory and sight and a decay of strenght there is a sense of weight and giddiness of the head and a ringing in the ears and as the disorder proceeds all the symptoms are increased the legs swell as in dropical cases in some ulcers arise on the loins some of which are healed whilst others rise in their stead at last a violent cataract arising the patient is rendered totally blind these are followed by some others as a thirst an hectical disposition an atrophy a wasting of the flesh etc etc till at last the body is brought to the highest degree of a consumption and that very often without any cough or any other remarkable sign of a consumption of the lungs  these are the most common disorders that ensue from the excessive use of venery and the preposterous practice of selfpollution for the cure of which i have two medicines which i shall recommend the first which answers the first intention of cure viz the stopping of the gonorrhaea is my strengthening electuary which braces up and strengthens the weakened and relaxed solids warms and invigorates the habit promotes digestion and thereby furnishes the dispirited and impoverished blood with laudable and benign chyle  the other medicine is my restorative nervous elixir which is perhaps the most stimulating restorative that medicine can produce and in the last decays of life will still supply the vital lamp with some recruits it is good in all languors weakness and decays of the constitution for it strengthens all parts of the body especially the stomach when relaxed and disordered with frequent debauches and by restoring the oscillation of the fibers quickens the various motions and gives fresh vigor to the animal functions it is an admirable remedy for those who have been in a manner wore out with venereal engagements especially if their pleasures have been purchased at the expense of a few salivations or a frequent use of mercurial medicines and it will revive any constitution that it not quite mouldered into rottenness but they best deserve such a restorative who by acute diseases such as malignant fevers the smallpox and the like have been so broke and shattered in their constitutions as hardly to be within a possibility of recovery for in such it will to admiration repair the impoverished juices and fill again the veins with a warm generous nutritive blood  it is excellent in diseases of the head arising from a consent with the stomach such as the vertigo headache sleepy diseases dread of an apoplexy weakness of the memory and sight and a noise or ringing in the ears in scrophulous habits also which are leaning toward consumptions it will be of the utmost service and when young persons are not so early happy in their conjugal embraces as many wish to be and it be suspected from a coldness and insufficiency upon that account on either side the use of this medicine cannot fail to render their intercourse prolific as it actually romoves the causes of impotency in one sex and of sterility or barrenness in the other but the use of it is varily to be indulged lest with it be kindled a heat that reasonable coition cannot assuage and let such as indulge themselves too lavishly in these enjoyments be careful how they spur nature and prompt with such helps lest they run off their life and strength too precipitately for the best constitutions in the world wear out and sink under the frequent repetition of such profusion as the frequent straining any elastic body whatsoever will weaken more and more it is spring till it is quite lost notwithstanding all the helps of art to preserve it  to conclude the omnipotent creator has given us passions for very wise and good ends which seem to be that thereby we may be urged with a kind of impetuosity to shun evil and embrace good wherefore the passions are not bad in themselves it is by their excess that they become vicious when they rise to so extravagant a pitch as not to be governed by the dictates of reason but we ought to use our best endeavors to keep them within proper bounds and the more difficult the conflict the more glorious will be the victory  we have all a natural propensity to pleasures but these are of two very different sorts the sensual and the mental sensual pleasures engross the greatest part of mankind while these few only quos equus amavit jupiter are taken with the beauties of the mental and the reason why so many run after pleasures of the first sort seems to be because they hardly ever allow themselves an opportunity of tasting the sweets of an upright conscience or of feeling that joy which arises to a good man from the moderation of his irregular desires and being entirely devoted to the gratification of their sensual appetites they never give attention to the real charms of virtue wherefore whosoever desires to enjoy this solid happiness ought to enure himself by degrees to the love of virtue and ever carefully to avoid adding fuel to the fire of his passions  apposite to these sentiments is that saying which cicero puts into the mouth of cato as by him received from the great archytas of terentum that nature never afflicted mankind with a more capital plague than bodily pleasure the eager desires of which spur on to enjoyment with ungovernable rashness de senectute cap xii   and the rest of what that great philosopher has written on this subject must delight the mind of every wise man in the perusal wherefore virtues exclamation in silius italicus is very just quippe nec ira deum tantum nec tela nec hosts quantum sola noces animis illapsa voluptas punicorum lib xv ver     pleasure by gliding on the minds of men more mischiefs have thou wrought than hostile arms than wrath of gods   but as the due government of the passions strengthens the mind so temperance in diet renders the body less exposed to these turbulent motions and this rule holds good not only in those who are naturally of a hot constitution but even in those who curb their appetites because it keeps them in a state of tranquillity and this is the way in general to resist these evils or at least to diminish their effects  as for those who would have us to be entirely devoid of passions and to suppress all the affections of the mind as if they were so many evils they certainly have a wrong notion of the wisdom and goodness of the almighty creator who has inserted and as it were interwoven them into our frame for excellent purposes for they are not only beneficial to individuals upon many occasions but even necessary for keeping up society and connexions between mankind  finis advertisement the medicines recommended in this treatise with full
