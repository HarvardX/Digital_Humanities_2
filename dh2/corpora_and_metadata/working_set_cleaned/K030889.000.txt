ancient and modern italy compared being the first part of liberty a poem  by mr thomson  london inted for a millar over against st clements church in the strand mdccxxxv price one shilling  to his royal highness frederick prince of wales sir when i reflect upon that ready condescension that preventing generosity with which your royal highness received the following poem under your protection i can alone ascribe it to the recommendation and influence of the subject in you the cause and concerns of liberty have so zealous a patron as entitles whatever may have the least tendency to promote them to the distinction of your favor and who can entertain this delightful reflection without feeling a pleasure far superior to that of the fondest author and of which all true lovers of their country must participate to behold the noblest dispositions of the prince and of the patriot united an overflowing benevolence generosity and candor of heart joined to an enlightened zeal for liberty an intimate persuasion that on it depends the happiness and glory both of kings and people to see these shining out in public virtues as they have hitherto smiled in all the social lights and private accomplishments of life is a prospect that cannot but inspire a general sentiment of satisfaction and gladness more easy to be felt than expressed  if the following attempt to trace liberty from the first ages down to her excellent establishment in great britain can at all merit your approbation and prove an entertainment to your royal highness if it can in any degree answer the dignity of the subject and of the name under which i presume to shelter it i have my best reward particularly as it affords me an opportunity of declaring that i am with the greatest zeal and respect  sir your royal highnesss most obedient and most devoted servant james thomson  liberty part i omy lamented talbot while with thee the muse gayrovd the glad hesperian round and drew the inspiring breath of ancient arts ah little thought she her returning verse should sing our darling subject to thy shade and does the mystic veil from mortal beam involve those eyes where every virtue smiled and all the fathers candid spirit shone the light of reason pure without a cloud full of the generous heart the mild regard unblemished honor uncorrupted faith and limpid truth that looks the very soul but to the death of mighty nations turned my strain be there absorbed the private tear musing i lay warm from the sacred walks where at each step imagination burns ten thousand wonders rolling in my thought as the great scene of deathless deeds i tread tread the blessed ground by more than mortals trod and see those skies that breathed the roman soul mean time widescatterd round awful and hoar lies a vast monument once glorious rome the tomb of empire ruins that efface whatever of finished modern pomp can boast of these ideas full reposing sense in slumber sunk and fancys magic hand led me anew over all the solemn scene still in the minds pure eye more solemn dressed when strait methought the fair majestic power of liberty appeared not as of old extended in her hand the cap and rod whose slaveinlarging touch gave double life but her bright temples bound with british oak and naval honors nodded on her brow sublime her port loose over her shoulder flowed her seagreen robe with constellations gay an island goddess now and her high care the queen of isles the mistress of the main my heart beat filial transport at the sight and as she moved to speak the awakened muse listened intense a while she looked around with mournful eye the wellknown ruins marked and then her sighs repressing thus began mine are these wonders all thou see is mine but ah how changed the falling poor remains of what exalted once the ausonian shore look back through time and from the gloom disclosed painting my words behold the scattered scene the great republic see that glowed sublime with the mixed freedom of a thousand states raised on the thrones of kings her curule chair and by her fasces awed the subject world see busy millions swarming all the land with cities thronged and teeming culture high for on her freeborn sons then nature smiled and poured the plenty that belongs to men behold the country chearing villas rise in lively prospect by the secret lapse of brooks now lost and streams renowned in song in umbrias closing vales or on the brow of her brown hills that breathe the scented gale on baias viny coast where peaceful seas fand by kind zephirs ever kiss the shore and suns unclouded shine and purest air or in the spacious neighborhood of rome farshining upwards to the sabine hills to anios roar and tiburs olive shade to where preneste lifts her airy brow or downwards spreading to the sunny shore waved from the main where alba draws the breeze see distant mountains leave their valleys dry and over the proud arcade their tribute pour to lave imperial rome for ages laid deep massy firm diverging every way from sea to sea her public roads behold by various nations trod and suppliant kings with legions flaming or with triumph green full in the center of these wondrous works while tombs of heroes consecrate the way the pride of earth rome in her glory see behold her demigods in senate met all head to counsel and all heart to act the commonweal inspiring every tongue with fervent eloquence unbribd and bold ere low corruption taught the servile herd to know a masters voice astonished mark her forum earnest popular and loud in trembling wonder hushed when the two l j brutus and virginius sires as they the private father greatly quelled stood up the public fathers of the state see justice judging there in human shape hark how with freedoms voice it thunders high or in soft murmurs sinks to tullys tongue her tribes her census see her generous troops whose pay was glory and whose best reward free for their country and for me to die ere mercenary murder grew a trade mark as the purple triumph waves along the highest pomp and lowest fall of life her festive games the school of heroes see her circus ardent with contending youth her streets her temples palaces and baths full of fair forms of beautys eldest born and of a race by plastic virtue marked while sculpture lives around and asian hills lend their best stores to heave the pillard dome all that to roman grandeur the soft touch of grecian art can join but language fails to paint this sun this center of mankind where every virtue glory treasure art attracted strong in heightened luster met need i the contrast mark unjoyous view a land in all in government and arts in virtue genius heaven and earth reversed who but these farfamd ruins to behold proofs of a people whose heroic aims soared far above the little selfish sphere of doubting modern life who but inflamed with classic zeal the consecrated scenes of men and deeds to trace the wonder theme and model of mankind unhappy land would trust thy wilds and cities loose of sway are these the vales that once exulting states in their warm bosom fed the mountains these on whose highblooming sides my sons of old i bred to glory these dejected towns sordid and mean where life can scarce subsist the scenes of ancient opulence and pomp come by whatever sacred name disguised oppression come and in thy works rejoice see natures richest plains to putrid fens turned by thy rage from their unchearful bounds see razed the enlivening village farm and seat first rural toil by thy rapacious hand robbed of his poor reward resigned the plow and now he dares not turn the noxious glebe it is thine entire the lonely swain himself who loves at large along the grassy downs his flocks to pasture thine abhorrent flies far as the sickening eye can sweep around it is all one desert desolate and gray grazed by the sullen bufalo alone and where the rank unventilated growth of rotting ages taints the passing gale beneath the baleful blast the city pines or sinks infeebld or infected burns beneath it mourns the solitary road rolled in rude mazes over the abandoned waste while ancient ways ingulphd are seen no more such thy dire plains thou selfdestroyer foe to humankind thy mountains too profuse where savage nature blooms seem their sad plaint to raise against thy desolating rod there on the breezy brow where thriving states and famous cities once to the pleased sun far other scenes of rising culture spread pale shine thy ragged towns neglected round each harvest pines the livid lean produce of heartless labor while thy hated joys not proper pleasure lift the lazy hand better to sink in sloth the woes of life than wake their rage with unavailing toil hence drooping art almost to nature leaves the rude unguided year thin wave the gifts of yellow ceres thin the radiant blush of orchard reddens in the warmest ray to weedy wildness run no rural wealth such as dictators fed the garden pours crude the wild olive flows and foul the vine nor juice coecubian nor falernian more streams life and joy save in the muses bowl unseconded by art the spinning race draw the bright thread in vain and idly toil in vain forlorn in wilds the citron blows and flowering plants perfume the desert gale through the vile hedge the tender myrtle twines inglorious droops the laurel dead to song and long a stranger to the heros brow nor half thy triumph this cast from brute fields into the haunts of men thy ruthless eye there buxom plenty never turns her horn the grace and virtue of exterior life no clean convenience reigns even sleep itself least delicate of powers reluctant there lays on the bed impure his heavy head thy horrid walk dead empty unadorned see streets whose echos never know the voice of cheerful hurry commerce manytongued and art mechanic at his various task fervent employed mark the desponding race of occupation void as void of hope hope the glad ray glanced from eternal good that life enlivens and exalts it is powers with views of fortune  madness all to them by thee relentless seized their better joys to the soft aid of cordial airs they fly a kind oblivion breathing over their woes and love and music melt their souls away from feeble justice see how rash revenge trembling the balance snatches and her sword fearful himself to venal ruffians gives see where gods altar nursing murder stands with the red touch of dark assassins stained but chief let rome the mighty city speak the fullexerted genius of thy reign behold her rise amid the lifeless waste expiring nature all corrupted round while the lone tyber through the desert shore winds his waste stores and sullen sweeps along patched from my fragments in unsolid pomp mark how the temple glares and artful dressed amusive draws the superstitious train mark how the palace lifts a lying front concealing often in magnific jail proud want a deep unanimated gloom and often joining to the drear abode of misery whose melancholy walls seem its voracious grandeur to reproach within the city bounds the desert see see the rank vine over subterranean roofs indecent spread beneath whose fretted gold it once exulting flowed the people mark matchless while fired by me to public good inexorably firm just generous brave afraid of nothing but unworthy life elate with glory an heroic soul known to the vulgar breast behold them now a thin despairing number all subdued the slaves of slaves by superstition fooled by vice unmanned and a licentious rule in guile ingenious and in murder brave such in one land beneath the same fair clime thy sons oppression are and such were mine even with thy labored state for whose vain show deluded thousands starve all agebegrimd torn robbed and scattered in unnumberd sacks and by the tempest of two thousand years continual shaken let my ruins vie these roads that yet the roman hand assert beyond the weak repair of modern toil these fracturd arches that the chiding stream no more delighted hear these rich remains of marbles now unknown where shines imbibed each parent ray these massy columns hewed from africks farthest shore one granite all these obelisks hightowering to the sky mysterious marked with dark egyptian lore these endless wonders that this via sacra sacred way illumine still and consecrate to fame these fountains vases urns and statues charged with the fine stores of artcompleating greece from these too drawn mine is thy every boast thy mangelo buonaroti palladio and raphael durbino the three great modern masters in sculpture architecture and painting buonarotis thy palladios mine and mine the fair designs that raphaels soul over the live canvass emanating breathed what would you say ye conquerors of earth ye romans could you raise the laureled head could you the country see with seas of blood and the dread toil of ages won so dear your pride your triumph your supreme delight for whose defense often in the doubtful hour you rushed with rapture down the gulf of fate of death ambitious till by awful deeds virtues and courage that amaze mankind the queen of nations rose possessed of all that nature art and glory could bestow what would you say deep in the last abyss of slavery vice and unambitious want thus to behold her sunk your crowded plains void of their cities unadorned your hills ungracd your lakes your ports to ships unknown your lawless floods and your abandoned streams these could you know these could you love again thy tibur horace could it now inspire content poetic ease and rural joy soon bursting into song while through the groves of headlong anio dashing to the vale in many a tortured stream you mused along tusculum is reckoned to have stood at a place now called grotta ferrata a convent of monks yon wild retreat where superstition dreams could tully you your tusculum believe and could you deem yon naked hills that form famed in old song the shipforsaken the bay of mola anciently formiae into which homer brings ulysses and his companions near formiae cicero had a villa bay your formian shore once the delight of earth where art and nature eversmiling joined on the gay land to lavish all their stores how changed how vacant virgil wide around would now your naples seem disasterd less by black vesuvius thundering over the coast his midnight earthquakes and his mining fires than by despotic rage that inward gnaws a native foe a foreign tears without first from your flattered caesars this begun till houseless spreads at last the campagna selice adjoining to capua siren plain that the dire soul of hannibal disarmed and wrapped in weeds the the coast of baia which was formerly adorned with the works mentioned in the following lines and where amidst many magnificent ruins those of a temple erected to venus are still to be seen shore of venus lies there baia sees no more the joyous throng her banks all beaming with the pride of rome no generous vines now bask along the hills where sport the breezes of the tyrrhene main with baths and temples mixed no villas rise nor artsustaind amid reluctant waves draw the cool murmurs of the breathing deep no spreading ports their sacred arms extend no mighty moles the big intrusive storm from the calm station roll resounding back an almost total desolation sits a dreary stillness sadning over the coast all along this coast the ancient romans had their winter retreats and several populous cities stood where when soft suns and tepid winters rose rejoicing crowds inhald the balm of peace where cityd hill to hill reflected blaze and where with ceres bacchus wont to hold a genial strife her youthful form robust even nature yields by fire and earthquake rent whole stately cities in the dark abrupt swallowed at once or vile in rubbish laid a nest for serpents from the red abyss new hills explosive thrown the lucrine lake a reedy pool and all to cumas point the sea recovering his usurped domain and poured triumphant over the buried dome hence britain learn my bestestablishd last and more than greece or rome my steady reign the land where king and people equal bound by guardian laws my fullest blessings flow and where my jealous unsubmitting soul the dread of tyrants burns in every breast learn hence if such the miserable fate of an heroic race the masters once of humankind what when deprived of me how grievous must be thine in spite of climes whose sunenlivend ether wakes the soul to higher powers in spite of happy soils that but by labors slightest aid impelled with treasures teem to thy cold clime unknown if there desponding fail the common arts and sustenance of life could life itself or heartconsumd a tyrants rotten pomp subsist with thee against depressing skies joined to fullspread oppressions cloudy brow how could thy spirits hold where vigor find forced fruits to tear from their unnative soil or every harvest storing in thy ports profuse of all to plow the dreadful wave here paused the goddess by the pause assured in trembling accents thus i moved my prayer oh first and most benevolent of powers come from eternal splendors here on earth against despotic pride and rage and lust to shield mankind to raise them to assert the native rights and honor of their race teach me thy lowest subject but in zeal yielding to none the progress of thy reign and with a strain from thee enrich the muse for thy proud slave alone her patron thou and great inspirer be then will she joy though narrow life her lot and private shade and when her venal voice she barters vile or to thy open or thy secret foes may never those sacred raptures touch her more by slavish hearts unfelt and may her song sink in oblivion with the nameless crew vermin of state to thy overflowing light that owe their being yet betray thy cause then condescending kind the heavenly power returned  what here suggested by the scene i slight unfold record and sing at home in that blessed isle where so we spirits move with one quick effort of my will i am there truth unlicensd walks even kings themselves invite her forth the monarchs of the free by that best glory pierced that godlike joy that gay security that pride of rule when men not slaves when allperforming love not sluggish hate and faithless fear obey fixed on my rock there an indulgent race over britons wield the scepter of the heart and mixing worth with worth the royal pair to steady justice yielding goodness join nor sets the prospect in this pleasing view while there to finish what his sires began a prince behold for me who burns sincere even with a subjects zeal he my great work will parentlike sustain and added give the touch the graces and the muses owe for britains glory swells his panting breast and ancient arts he emulous revolves his pride to let the smiling heart abroad through clouds of pomp that but conceal the man to please his pleasure bounty his delight and all the soul of titus dwells in him hail glorious theme but how alas shall verse from the crude stores of mortal language drawn how faint and tedious sing what piercing deep the goddess flashed at once upon my soul for clear precision all the tongue of gods is harmony itself to every ear familiar known like light to every eye mean time disclosing ages as she spoke in dread succession poured their empires forth scene after scene the human drama spread and still thembodyd picture rushed to sight oh thou to whom the muses owe their flame who bidst beneath the pole parnassus rise and hippocrene flow with thy bold ease the striking force the lightning of thy thought and thy strong phrase that rowls profound and clear oh gracious goddess reinspire my song while i to nobler than poetic fame aspiring thy commands
