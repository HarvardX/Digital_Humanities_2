displayed an elegance and variety of colors sufficient to arrest the admiration of ancient philosophers and furnish them with the happiest simile to abash human ostentation when croesus king of lydia was seated on his throne adorned with royal magnificence and all the barbarous pomp of eastern splendor he asked solon if he had ever beheld any thing so fine the greek philosopher no way moved by the objects before him or taking a pride in his native simplicity replied that after having seen the beautiful plumage of the pheasant he could be astonished at no other finery buffon   perhaps there are few tribes of birds in which nature has been more profuse of her amplest coloring than that of the pheasant the common species as we now consider it in this country notwithstanding its beauty is inferior in that respect to two others that are also found at large in some of our woods the ring and painted pheasants are far more richly decorated and these may probably be as abundant in future generations as the common pheasant is at present the variegated pheasant is beautiful and the scarcely exampled delicacy of the white kind renders it an interesting variety the beauty of all these varieties are however eclipsed by the argus pheasant and probably were we better acquainted with the phasianus superbus and some other gigantic chinese species colonel davies has a drawing of the tail feather of one of the chinese species of pheasants which is six feet in length  we might place them among the most brilliant of the feathered race  at what period of time the pheasant was introduced into this country it is impossible now to ascertain they have in all probability been long naturalized in this country some of our domestic fowls it is supposed were introduced more than two thousand years ago caesar noticing them whether this circumstance may assist conjecture concerning the introduction of the pheasant we dare not presume to determine pheasants were first brought into europe

female  they breed like the partridge on the ground lay from twelve to fifteen eggs smaller than those of the hen and of a paler color than those of the partridge the young follow the females like chickens  several authors have noticed a circumstance of this bird which surprising as it may appear is by no means peculiar to the pheasant only after the hen has done laying and setting the plumage of the female becomes like that of the male and she is then entirely neglected by him salerne edwards and others have mentioned this of the pheasant guinea hen rock manakin etc and mr j hunter had a paper in the philosophical transactions on that subject latham observes that it does not always require mature age to give the hen pheasant the appearance of the male   plate cii anas albifrons white

bernacle goose of which credulity has reported so much and we may think naturalists have said too little for it seems yet but doubtful with some ornithologists whether the opinion of linnaeus be wholly unfounded in truth or not though they have ventured to separate them into distinct species  as many kinds of the duck tribe inhabit the lakes and forests of lapland and other arctic regions during the breeding season it is difficult in some instances to distinguish the mere differences of sex or age from specific distinctions the bernacle of which the white fronted goose has been supposed the female were believed about two hundred years to be bred on the coast of scotland but those who asserted this declared also that they were generated out of decayed wood or were hatched in the shell of the lepas antifera a marine production very common in those parts it has several membranous branches or arms and at the end of each is situated a multivalve shell the feathered beard of

red and a crescent of the same color under the throat the wings are yellowish  goldfinches of the opposite extreme of color are not uncommon some are entirely black with a slight trace of red about the head in others even this trace is obliterated birds that are fed on hemp seed of which the goldfinch will eat freely often become entirely black buffon mentions one in which the head only was of

esteemed among us it is said that when alexander was in india he sound vast numbers on the banks of the hyarotis and was so delighted with their beauty that he appointed a punishment for those who should kill any of them  it is also found in africa  in our climate the peacock does not come to its full plumage till the third year the female lays five or six greyish eggs the size of those of a turkey the time of sitting is from twentyseven to thirty days the young are fed on barleymeal chopped leeks and curd the old ones on wheat barley etc  it is an italian proverb that the peacock has the

conclusion  the plumage of many birds differ considerably in colors and markings in the various stages of their growth and even in the adult state we frequently observe varieties which it is difficult to refer to their true species  from the general appearance of the bird before us it has been thought the young of the common tern and it stands for such in the leverian museum it cannot however be the young bird of that species in the contour it is obviously different and the form of the beak with other striking peculiarities must certainly remove it from that species  mr latham in describing the sandwich tern says the back and wings are a pale hoary lead color and in the young birds are much clouded with brown he says also the head is much dotted with white in some specimens but observes that all terns with black heads are liable to the same variation in the adult common tern the black of the head extends to the base of the bill in the sandwich tern the forehead is white  thus far our specimen may be considered as the sandwich tern but the color of the legs and claws of that bird is uniformly said to be black while in ours they are orange this is however accidental and by no means

trained bird entice them into its labyrinths the decoy nets are generally placed on a piece of water nearly surrounded with wood that the birds may not be frightened or disturbed they are so contrived that different pipes lead to it from several directions these pipes are so many avenues of network supported by hoops which become gradually narrower from the opening and lead up a ditch at the end of which the funnel net is placed along these pipes at proper intervals are screens of reeds behind which the decoy man conceals himself from the birds the ducks trained for decoys are fed on hemp seed which being light floats on the surface of the water when the evening sets in the decoy man throws some of the seeds from behind one of the screens to the trained bird this entices him into the pipe and the wild fowl follow when they arrive at a certain part of the avenue the decoy bird dives under the water and the rest pass on till they enter the purse net where they are taken  brit zool etc
