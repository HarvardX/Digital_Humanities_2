and its kinds   0 an history of birds continuation of part v of birds of the crane kind chap vi of the bittern or miredrum those who have walked in an evening by the sedgy sides of unfrequented rivers must remember a variety of notes from different waterfowl the loud scream of the wild goose the croaking of the mallard the whining of the lapwing and the tremulous neighing of the jacksnipe but of all those sounds there is none so dismally hollow as the booming of the bittern it is impossible for words to give those who have not heard this eveningcall an adequate idea of its solemnity it is like the interrupted bellowing of a bull but hollower and louder and is heard at a miles distance as if issuing from some formidable being that resided at the bottom of the waters  the bird however that produces this terrifying sound is not so big as an heron with a weaker bill and not above four inches long it differs from the heron chiefly in its color which is in general of a paleish yellow spotted and barred with black its windpipe is fitted to produce the sound for which it is remarkable the lower part of it dividing into the lungs is supplied with a thin loose membrane that can be filled with a large body of air and exploded at pleasure these bellowing explosions are chiefly heard from the beginning of spring to the end of autumn and however awful they may seem to us are the calls to courtship or of connubial felicity  from the loudness and solemnity of the note many have been led to suppose that the bird made use of external instruments to produce it and that so small a body could never eject such a quantity of tone the common people are of opinion that it thrusts its bill into a reed that serves as a pipe for swelling the note above its natural pitch while others and in this number we find thomson the poet imagine that the bittern puts its head under water and then violently blowing produces its boomings the fact is that the bird is sufficiently provided by nature for this call and it is often heard where there are neither reeds nor waters to assist its sonorous invitations  it hides in the sedges by day and begins its call in the evening booming six or eight times and then discontinuing for ten or twenty minutes to renew the same sound this is a call it never gives but when undisturbed and at liberty when its retreats among the sedges are invaded when it dreads or expects the approach of an enemy it is then perfectly silent this call it has never been heard to utter when taken or brought up in domestic captivity it continues under the control of man a mute forlorn bird equally incapable of attachment or instruction but though its boomings are always performed in solitude it has a scream which is generally heard upon the seizing its prey and which is sometimes extorted by fear  this bird though of the heronkind is yet neither so destructive nor so voracious it is a retired timorous animal concealing itself in the midst of reeds and marshy places and living upon frogs insects and vegetables and though so nearly resembling the heron in figure yet differing much in manners and appetites as the heron builds on the tops of the highest trees the bittern lays its nest in a sedgy margin or amidst a tuft of rushes the heron builds with sticks and wool the bittern composes its simpler habitation of sedges the leaves of waterplants and dry rushes the heron lays four eggs the bittern generally seven or eight of an ashgreen color the heron feeds its young for many days the bittern in three days leads its little ones to their food in short the heron is lean and cadaverous subsisting chiefly upon animal food the bittern is plump and fleshy as it feeds upon vegetables when more nourishing food is wanting  it cannot be therefore from its voracious appetites but its hollow boomb that the bittern is held in such detestation by the vulgar i remember in the place where i was a boy with what terror this birds note affected the whole village they considered it as the presage of some sad event and generally found or made one to succeed it i do not speak ludicrously but if any person in the neighborhood died they supposed it could not be otherwise for the nightraven had foretold it but if nobody happened to die the death of a cow or a sheep gave completion to the prophecy  whatever terror it may inspire among the simple its flesh is greatly in esteem among the luxurious for this reason it is as eagerly sought after by the fowler as it is shunned by the peasant and as it is a heavy rising slow winged bird it does not often escape him indeed it seldom rises but when almost trod upon and seems to seek protection rather from concealment than flight at the latter end of autumn however in the evening its wonted indolence appears to forsake it it is then seen rising in a spiral ascent till it is quite lost from the view making at the same time a singular noise very different from its former boomings thus the same animal is often seen to assume different desires and while the latins have given the bittern the name of the star reaching bird or the stellaris the greeks taking its character from its more constant habits have given it the title of the  or the lazy  chap vii of the spoonbill or shoveler as we proceed in our description of the crane kind birds of peculiar forms offer not entirely like the crane and yet not so far different as to rank more properly with any other class where the long neck and stiltlike legs of the crane are found they make too striking a resemblance not to admit such birds of the the number and though the bill or even the toes should entirely differ yet the outlines of the figure and the natural habits and dispositions being the same these are sufficient to mark their place in the general groupe of nature  the spoonbill is one of those birds which differs a good deal from the crane yet approaches this class more than any other the body is more bulky for its height and the bill is very differently formed from that of any other bird whatever yet still it is a comparatively tall bird it feeds among waters its toes are divided and it seems to possess the natural dispositions of the crane the european spoonbill is of about the bulk of a crane but depiction of the calao hornbill and the spoon bill   a species of the calao       the spoon bill  de seve del isc tailor sculp as the one is above four feet high the other is not more than three feet three inches the common color of those of europe is a dirty white but those of america are of a beautiful rose color or a delightful crimsom beauty of plumage seems to be the prerogative of all the birds of that continent and we here see the most splendid tints bestowed on a bird whose figure is sufficient to destroy the effects of its coloring for its bill is so odly fashioned and its eyes so stupidly staring that its fine feathers only tend to add splendor to deformity the bill which in this bird is so very particular is about seven inches long and running out broad at the end as its name justly serves to denote it is there about an inch and a half wide this strangely fashioned instrument in some is black in others of a light gray and in those of america it is of a red color like the rest of the body all round the upper chap there runs a kind of rim with which it covers that beneath and as for the rest its cheeks and its throat are without feathers and covered with a black skin  a bird so oddly fashioned might be expected to possess some very peculiar appetites but the spoonbill seems to lead a life entirely resembling all those of the crane kind and nature when she made the bill of this bird so very broad seems rather to have sported with its form than to aim at any final cause for which to adapt it in fact it is but a poor philosophy to ascribe every capricious variety in nature to some salutary purpose in such solutions we only impose upon each other and often wilfully contradict our own belief there must be imperfections in every being as well as capacities of enjoyment between both the animal leads a life of moderate felicity in part making use of its many natural advantages and in part necessarily conforming to the imperfections of its figure  the shoveler chiefly feeds upon frogs toads and serpents of which particularly at the cape of good hope they destroy great numbers the inhabitants of that country hold them in as much esteem as the ancient egyptians did their bird ibis the shoveler runs tamely about their houses and they are content with its society as a useful though an homely companion they are never killed and indeed they are good for nothing when they are dead for the flesh is unfit to be eaten  this bird breeds in europe in company with the heron in high trees and in a nest formed of the same materials willoughby tells us that in a certain grove at a village called seven huys near leyden they build and breed yearly in great numbers in this grove also the heron the bittern the cormorant and the shag have taken up their residence and annually bring forth their young together here the crane kind seem to have formed their general rendezvous and as the inhabitants say every sort of bird has its several quarter where none but their own tribe are permitted to reside of this grove the peasants of the country make good profit when the young ones are ripe those that farm the grove with a hook at the end of a long pole catch hold of the bough on which the nest is built and shake out the young ones but sometimes the nest and all tumble down together  the shoveler lays from three to five eggs white and powdered with a few sanguine or pale spots we sometimes see in the cabinets of the curious the bills of american shovelers twice as big and as long as those of the common kind among us but these birds have not yet made their way into europe  chap viii the flamingo the flamingo has the justest right to be placed among cranes and though it happens to be webfooted like birds of the goose kind yet its height figure and appetites entirely remove it from that grovelling class of animals with a longer neck and legs than any other of the crane kind it seeks its food by wading among waters and only differs from all of this tribe in the manner of seizing its prey for as the heron makes use of its claws the flamingo uses only its bill which is strong and thick for the purpose the claws being useless as they are feeble and webbed like those of waterfowl  the flamingo is the most remarkable of all the crane kind the tallest bulkiest and the most beautiful the body which is of a beautiful scarlet is no bigger than that of a swan but its legs and neck are of such an extraordinary length that when it stands erect it is six feet six inches high its wings extended are five feet six inches from tip to tip and it is four feet eight inches from tip to tail the depiction of the flamingo and the avosetta avocet   flamingo   avosetta  de seve del isc tailor sculp head is round and small with a large bill seven inches long partly red partly black and crooked like a bow the legs and thighs which are not much thicker than a mans finger are about two feet eight inches high and its neck near three feet long the feet are not furnished with sharp claws as in others of the crane kind but feeble and united by membranes as in those of the goose of what use these membranes are does not appear as the bird is never seen swimming its legs and thighs being sufficient for bearing it into those depths where it seeks for prey  this extraordinary bird is now chiefly found in america but was once known on all the coasts of europe its beauty its size and the peculiar delicacy of its flesh have been such temptations to destroy or take it that it has long since deserted the shores frequented by man and taken refuge in countries that are as yet but thinly peopled in those desert regions the flamingos live in a state of society and under a better polity than any other of the feathered creation  when the europeans first came to america and coasted down along the african shores they found the flamingos on several shores on either continent gentle and no way distrustful of mankind albins new history of birds  they had long been used to security in the extensive solitudes they had chosen and knew no enemies but those they could very well evade or oppose the negroes and the native americans were possessed but of few destructive arts for killing them at a distance and when the bird perceived the arrow it well knew how to avoid it but it was otherwise when the europeans first came among them the sailors not considering that the dread of firearms was totally unknown in that part of the world gave the flamingo the character of a foolish bird that suffered itself to be approached and shot at when the fowler had killed one the rest of the flock far from attempting to fly only regarded the fall of their companion in a kind of fixed astonishment another and another shot was discharged and thus the fowler often levelled the whole flock before one of them began to think of escaping  but at present it is very different in that part of the world and the flamingo is not only one of the scarcest but of the shyest birds in the world and the most difficult of approach they chiefly keep near the most deserted and inhospitable shores near salt water lakes and swampy islands they come down to the banks of rivers by day and often retire to the inland mountainous parts of the country at the approach of night when seen by mariners in the day they always appear drawn up in a long close line of two or three hundred together and as dampier tells us present at the distance of half a mile the exact representation of a long brick wall their rank however is broken when they seek for food but they always appoint one of the number as a watch whose only employment is to observe and give notice of danger while the rest are feeding as soon as this trusty sentinel perceives the remotest appearance of danger he gives a loud scream with a voice as shrill as a trumpet and instantly the whole cohort are upon the wing they feed in silence but upon this occasion all the flock are in one chorus and fill the air with intolerable screamings  from this it appears that the flamingos are very difficult to be approached at present and that they avoid mankind with the most cautious timidity however it is not from any antipathy to man that they shun his society for in some villages as we are assured by labat along the coast of africa the flamingos come in great numbers to make their residence among the natives there they assemble by thousands perched on the trees within and about the village and are so very clamorous that the sound is heard at near a mile distance the negroes are fond of their company and consider their society as a gift of heaven as a protection from accidental evils the french who are admitted to this part of the coast cannot without some degree of discontent see such a quantity of game untouched and rendered useless by the superstition of the natives they now and then privately shoot some of them when at a convenient distance from the village and hide them in the long grass if they perceive any of the negroes approaching for they would probably stand a chance of being ill treated if the blacks discovered their sacred birds were thus unmercifully treated  sometimes in their wild state they are shot by mariners and their young which run excessively fast are often taken labat has frequently taken them with nets properly extended round the places they breed in when their long legs are entangled in the meshes they are then unqualified to make their escape but they still continue to combat with their destroyer and the old ones though seized by the head will scratch with their claws and these though seemingly inoffensive very often do mischief when they are fairly disengaged from the net they nevertheless preserve their natural ferocity they refuse all nourishment they peck and combat with their claws at every opportunity the fowler is therefore under a necessity of destroying them when taken as they would only pine and die if left to themselves in captivity the flesh of the old ones is black and hard though dampier says well tasted that of the young ones is still better but of all other delicacies the flamingos tongue is the most celebrated a dish of flamingos tongues says our author is a feast for an emperor in fact the roman emperors considered them as the highest luxury and we have an account of one of them who procured fifteen hundred flamingos tongues to be served up in a single dish the tongue of this bird which is so much sought after is a good deal larger than that of any other bird whatever the bill of the flamingo is like a large black box of an irregular figure and filled with a tongue which is black and gristly but what peculiar flavor it may possess i leave to be determined by such as understand good eating better than i do it is probable that the beauty and scarcity of the bird might be the first inducements to studious gluttony to fix upon its tongue as meat for the table what dampier says of the goodness of its flesh cannot so well be relied on for dampier was often hungry and thought any thing good that could be eaten he avers indeed with labat that the flesh is black tough and fishy so that we can hardly give him credit when he asserts that its flesh can be formed into a luxurious entertainment  these birds as was said always go in flocks together and they move in rank in the manner of cranes they are sometimes seen at the break of day flying down in great numbers from the mountains and conducting each other with a trumpet cry that sounds like the word tococo from whence the savages of canada have given them the name in their flight they appear to great advantage for they then seem of as bright a red as a burning coal when they dispose themselves to feed their cry ceases and then they disperse over a whole marsh in silence and assiduity their manner of feeding is very singular the bird thrusts down its head so that the upper unequal side of the bill shall only touch the ground and in this position the animal appears as it were standing upon its head in this manner it paddles and moves the bill about and seizes whatever fish or insect happens to offer for this purpose the upper chap is notched at the edges so as to hold its prey with the greater security catesby however gives a different account of their feeding according to him they thus place the upper chap undermost and so work about in order to pick up a seed from the bottom of the water that resembles millet but as in picking up this they necessarily also suck in a great quantity of mud their bill is toothed at the edges in such a manner as to let out the mud while they swallow the grain  their time of breeding is according to the climate in which they reside in north america they breed in our summer on the other side the line they take the most favorable season of the year they build their nests in extensive marshes and where they are in no danger of a surprise the nest is not less curious than the animal that builds it it is raised from the surface of the pool about a foot and a half formed of mud scraped up together and hardened by the sun or the heat of the birds body it resembles a truncated cone or one of the pots which we see placed on chimnies on the top it is hollowed out to the shape of the bird and in that cavity the female lays her eggs without any lining but the well cemented mud that forms the sides of the building she always lays two eggs and no more and as her legs are immoderately long she straddles on the nest while her legs hang down one on each side into the water  the young ones are a long while before they are able to fly but they run with amazing swiftness they are sometimes caught and very different from the old ones suffer themselves to be carried home and are tamed very easily in five or six days they become familiar eat out of the hand and drink a surprising quantity of seawater but though they are easily rendered domestic they are not reared without the greatest difficulty for they generally pine away for want of their natural supplies and die in a short time while they are yet young their colors are very different from those lively tints they acquire with age in their first year they are covered with plumage of a white color mixed with gray in the second year the whole body is white with here and there a slight tint of scarlet and the great covert feathers of the wings are black the third year the bird acquires all its beauty the plumage of the whole body is scarlet except some of the feathers in the wings that still retain their sable hue of these beautiful plumes the savages make various ornaments and the bird is sometimes skinned by the europeans to make muffs but these have diminished in heir price since we have obtained the art of dying feathers of the brightest scarlet  chap ix of the avosetta or scooper and the corrira or runner the extraordinary shape of the avosettas bill might incline us to wish for its history and yet in that we are not able to indulge the reader natural historians have hitherto like ambitious monarchs shown a greater fondness for extending their dominions than cultivating what they possess while they have been laboring to add new varieties to their catalogues they have neglected to study the history of animals already known  the avosetta is chiefly found in italy and now and then comes over into england it is about the size of a pigeon is a pretty upright bird and has extremely long legs for its size but the most extraordinary part of its figure and that by which it may be distinguished from all others of the feathered tribe is the bill which turns up like a hook in an opposite direction to that of the hawk or the parrot this extraordinary bill is black flat sharp and flexible at the end and about three inches and an half long from its being bare a long way above the knee it appears that it lives and wades in the waters it has a chirping pert note as we are told but with its other habits we are entirely unacquainted i have placed it from its slender figure among the cranes although it is webfooted like the duck it is one of those birds of whose history we are yet in expectation  to this bird of the crane kind so little known i will add another still less known the corrira or runner of aldrovandus all we are told of it is that it has the longest legs of all webfooted fowls except the flamingo and avosetta that the bill is straight yellow and black at the ends that the pupils of the eyes are surrounded with two circles one of which is bay and the other white below near the belly it is whitish the tail with two white feathers black at the extremities and that the upper part of the body is of the color of rusty iron it is thus that we are obliged to substitute dry description for instructive history and employ words to express those shadings of color which the pencil alone can convey  chap x of small birds of the crane kind with the thighs partly bare of feathers as i have taken my distinctions rather from the general form and manners of birds than from their minuter though perhaps more precise discriminations it will not be expected that i should here enter into a particular history of a numerous tribe of birds whose manners and forms are so very much alike of many of them we have scarce any account in our historians but tedious descriptions of their dimensions and the color of their plumage and of the rest the history of one is so much that of all that it is but the same account repeated to a most disgusting reiteration i will therefore groupe them into one general draught in which the more eminent or the most whimsical will naturally stand forward on the canvas  in this groupe we find an extensive tribe of native birds with their varieties and affinities and we might add an hundred others of distant climates of which we know little more than the color and the name in this list is exhibited the curlew a bird of about the size of a duck with a bill four inches long the woodcock about the size of a pigeon with a bill three inches long the god wit of the same size the bill four inches the green shank longer legged the bill two inches and an half the red shank differing in the color of its feet from the former the snipe less by half with a bill three inches then with shorter bills  the ruff with a collar of feathers round the neck of the male the knot the sandpiper the sanderling the dunlin the purre and the stint to conclude with bills very short  the lapwing the green plover the gray plover the dottrel the turnstone and the sealark these with their affinities are properly natives or visitants of this country and are dispersed along our shores rivers and watery grounds taking in the birds of this kind belonging to other countries the list would be very widely extended and the whole of this class as described by brisson would amount to near an hundred  all these birds possess many marks in common though some have peculiarities that deserve regard all these birds are bare of feathers above the knee or above the heel as some naturalists choose to express it in fact that part which i call the knee if compared with the legs of mankind is analogous to the heel but as it is commonly conceived otherwise i have conformed to the general apprehension i say therefore that all these birds are bare of feathers above the knee and in some they are wanting half way up the thigh the nudity in that part is partly natural and partly produced by all birds of this kind habitually wading in water the older the bird the barer are its thighs yet even the young ones have not the same downy covering reaching so low as the birds of any other class such a covering there would rather be prejudical as being continually liable to get wet in the water  as these birds are usually employed rather in running than in flying and as their food lies entirely upon the ground and not on trees or in the air so they run with great swiftness for their size and the length of their legs assists their velocity but as in seeking their food they are often obliged to change their station so also are they equally swift of wing and traverse immense tracts of country without much fatigue  it has been thought by some that a part of this class lived upon an oily slime found in the bottoms of ditches and of weedy pools they were thence termed by willoughby mudsuckers but later discoveries have shown that in these places they hunt for the caterpillars and worms of insects from hence therefore we may generally assert that all birds of this class live upon animals of one kind or another the long billed birds suck up worms and insects from the bottom those furnished with shorter bills pick up such insects as lie nearer the surface of the meadow or among the sands on the seashore  thus the curlew the woodcock and the snipe are ever seen in plashy brakes and under covered hedges assiduously employed in seeking out insects in their worm state and it seems from their fatness that they find a plentiful supply nature indeed has furnished them with very convenient instruments for procuring their food their bills are made sufficiently long for searching but still more they are endowed with an exquisite sensibility at the point for feeling their provision they are furnished with no less than three pair of nerves equal almost to the optic nerves in thickness which pass from the roof of the mouth and run along the upper chap to the point  nor are those birds with shorter bills and destitute of such convenient instruments without a proper provision made for their subsistence the lapwing the sandpiper and the redshank run with surprising rapidity along the surface of the marsh or the seashore quarter their ground with great dexterity and leave nothing of the insect kind that happens to lie on the surface these however are neither so fat nor so delicate as the former as they are obliged to toil more for a subsistence they are easily satisfied with whatever offers and their flesh often contracts a relish from what has been their latest or their principal food  most of the birds formerly described have stated seasons for feeding and rest the eagle kind prowl by day and at evening repose the owl by night and keeps unseen in the daytime but these birds of the crane kind seem at all hours employed they are seldom at rest by day and during the whole night season every meadow and marsh resounds with their different calls to courtship or to food this seems to be the time when they least fear interruption from man and though they fly at all times yet at this season they appear more assiduously employed both in providing for their present support and continuing that of posterity this is usually the season when the insiduous fowler steals in upon their occupations and fills the whole meadow with terror and destruction  as all of this kind live entirely in waters and among watery places they seem provided by nature with a warmth of constitution to fit them for that cold element they reside by choice in the coldest climates and as other birds migrate here in our summer their migrations hither are mostly in the winter even those that reside among us the whole season retire in summer to the tops of our bleakest mountains where they breed and bring down their young when the cold weather sets in  most of them however migrate and retire to the polar regions as those that remain behind in the mountains and keep with us during summer bear no proportion to the quantity which in winter haunt our marshes and low grounds the snipe sometimes builds here and the nest of the curlew is sometimes found in the plashes of our hills but the number of these is very small and it is most probable that they are only some stragglers who not having strength or courage sufficient for the general voyage take up from necessity their habitation here  in general during summer this whole class either choose the coldest countries to retire to or the coldest and the moistest part of ours to breed in the curlew the woodcock the snipe the godwit the gray plover the green and the long legged plover the knot and the turnstone are rather the guests than the natives of this island they visit us in the beginning of winter and forsake us in the spring they then retire to the mountains of sweden poland prussia and lapland to breed our country during the summer season becomes uninhabitable to them the ground parched up by the heat the springs dried away and the vermicular insects already upon the wing they have no means of subsisting their weak and delicately pointed bills are unfit to dig into a resisting soil and their prey is departed though they were able to reach its retreats thus that season when nature is said to teem with life and to put on her gayest liveries is to them an interval of sterility and famine the coldest mountains of the north are then a preferable habitation the marshes there are never totally dried up and the insects are in such abundance that both above ground and underneath the country swarms with them in such retreats therefore these birds would continue always but that the frosts when they set in have the same effect upon the face of the landscape as the heats of summer every brook is stiffened into ice all the earth is congealed into one solid mass and the birds are obliged to forsake a region where they can no longer find subsistence  such are our visitants with regard to those which keep with us continually and breed here they are neither so delicate in their food nor perhaps so warm in their constitutions the lapwing the ruff the redshank the sandpiper the seapie the norfolk plover and the sealark breed in this country and for the most part reside here in summer they frequent such marshes as are not dried up in any part of the year the essex hundreds and the fens of lincolnshire there in solitudes formed by surrounding marshes they breed and bring up their young in winter they come down from their retreats rendered uninhabitable by the flooding of the waters and seek their food about our ditches and marshly meadowgrounds yet even of this class all are wanderers upon some occasions and take wing to the northern climates to breed and find subsistence this happens when our summers are peculiarly dry and when the fenny countries are not sufficiently watered to defend their retreats  but though this be the usual course of nature with respect to these birds they often break through the general habits of their kind and as the lapwing the ruff and the sandpiper are sometimes seen to alter their manners and to migrate from hence instead of continuing to breed here so we often find the woodcock the snipe and the curlew reside with us during the whole season and breed their young in different parts of the country in casewood about two miles from tunbridge as mr penant assures us some woodcocks are seen to breed annually the young have been shot there in the beginning of august and were as healthy and vigorous as they are with us in winter though not so well tasted on the alps and other high mountains says willoughby the woodcock continues all summer i myself have flushed them on the top of mount jura in june and july the eggs are long of a pale red color and stained with deeper spots and clouds the nests of the curlew and the snipe are frequently found and some of these perhaps never entirely leave this island  it is thus that the same habits are in some measure common to all but in nestling and bringing up their young one method takes place universally as they all run and feed upon the ground so they are all found to nestle there the number of eggs generally to be seen in every nest is from two to four never under and very seldom exceeding the nest is made without any art but the eggs are either laid in some little depression of the earth or on a few bents and long grass that scarcely preserve them from the moisture below yet such is the heat of the body of these birds that their time of incubation is shorter than with any others of the same size the magpie for instance takes twentyone days to hatch its young the lapwing takes but fourteen whether the animal oil with which these birds abound gives them this superior warmth i cannot tell but there is no doubt of their quick incubation  in their seasons of courtship they pair as other birds but not without violent contests between the males for the choice of the female the lapwing and the plover are often seen to fight among themselves but there is one little bird of this tribe called the ruff that has got the epithet of the fighter merely from its great perseverance and animosity on these occasions in the beginning of spring when these birds arrive among our marshes they are observed to engage with desperate fury against each other it is then that the fowlers seeing them intent on mutual destruction spread their nets over them and take them in great numbers yet even in captivity their animosity still continues the people that fat them up for sale are obliged to shut them up in close dark rooms for if they let ever so little light in among them the turbulent prisoners instantly fall to fighting with each other and never cease till each has killed its antagonist especially says willoughby if any body stands by a similar animosity though in a less degree prompts all this tribe but when they have paired and begun to lay their contentions are then over  the place these birds chiefly choose to breed in is in some island surrounded with sedgy moors where men seldom resort and in such situations i have often seen the ground so strewed with eggs and nests that one could scarce take a step without treading upon some of them as soon as a stranger intrudes upon these retreats the whole colony is up and an hundred different screams are heard from every quarter the arts of the lapwing to allure men or dogs from her nest are perfectly amusing when she perceives the enemy approaching she never waits till they arrive at her nest but boldly runs to meet them when she has come as near them as she dares to venture she then rises with a loud screaming before them seeming as if she were just flushed from hatching while she is then probably a hundred yards from the nest thus she flies with great clamor and anxiety whining and screaming round the invaders striking at them with her wings and fluttering as if she were wounded to add to the deceit she appears still more clamorous as more remote from the nest if she sees them very near she then seems to be quite unconcerned and her cries cease while her terrors are really augmenting if there be dogs she flies heavily at a little distance before them as if maimed still vociferous and still bold but never offering to move toward the quarter where her treasure is deposited the dog pursues in hopes every moment of seizing the parent and by this means actually loses the young for the cunning bird when she has thus drawn him off to a proper distance then puts forth her powers and leaves her astonished pursuer to gaze at the rapidity of her flight the eggs of all these birds are highly valued by the luxurious they are boiled hard and thus served up without any further preparation  as the young of this class are soon hatched so when excluded they quickly arrive at maturity they run about after the mother as soon as they leave the egg and being covered with a thick down want very little of that clutching which all birds of the poultry kind that follow the mother indispensably require they come to their adult state long before winter and then flock together till the breeding season returns which for a while dissolves their society  as the flesh of almost all these birds is in high estimation so many methods have been contrived for taking them that used in taking the ruff seems to be the most advantageous and it may not be amiss to describe it the ruff which is the name of the male the reeve that of the female is taken in nets about forty yards long and seven or eight feet high these birds are chiefly found in lincolnshire and the isle of ely where they come about the latter end of april and disappear about michaelmas the male of this bird which is known from all others of the kind by the great length of the feathers round his neck is yet so various in his plumage that it is said no two ruffs were ever seen totally of the same color the nets in which these are taken are supported by sticks at an angle of near fortyfive degrees and placed either on dry ground or in very shallow water not remote from reeds among these the fowler conceals himself till the birds enticed by a stale or stuffed bird come under the nets he then by pulling a string lets them fall and they are taken as are godwits knots and gray plover also in the same manner when these birds are brought from under the net they are not killed immediately but fattened for the table with bread and milk hemp seed and sometimes boiled wheat but if expedition be wanted sugar is added which will make them a lump of fat in a fortnights time they are kept as observed before in a dark room and judgment is required in taking the proper time for killing them when they are at the highest pitch of fatness for if that is neglected the birds are apt to fall away they are reckoned a very great delicacy they sell for two shillings or half a crown a piece and are served up to the table with the train like woodcocks where we will leave them  chap xi of the waterhen and the coot before we enter upon waterfowls properly so called two or three birds claim our attention which seem to form the shade between the webfooted tribe and those of the crane kind these partake rather of the form than the habits of the crane and though furnished with long legs and necks rather swim than wade they cannot properly be called webfooted nor yet are they entirely destitute of membranes which fringe their toes on each side and adapt them for swimming the birds in question are the waterhen and the bald coot  these birds have too near an affinity not to be ranked in the same description they are shaped entirely alike their legs are long and their thighs partly bare their necks are proportionable their wings short their bills short and weak their color black their foreheads bald and without feathers and their habits entirely the same these however naturalists have thought proper to range in different classes from very slight distinctions in their figure the waterhen weighs but fifteen ounces the coot twentyfour the bald part of the forehead in the coot is black in the waterhen it is of a beautiful pink color the toes of the waterhen are edged with a straight membrane those of the coot have it scolloped and broader  the differences in the figure are but slight and those in their manner of living still less the history of the one will serve for both as birds of the crane kind are furnished with long wings and easily change place the waterhen whose wings are short is obliged to reside entirely near those places where her food lies she cannot take those long journeys that most of the crane kind are seen to perform compelled by her natural imperfections as well perhaps as by inclination she never leaves the side of the pond or the river in which she seeks for provision where the stream is selvaged with sedges or the pond edged with shrubby trees the waterhen is generally a resident there she seeks her food along the grassy banks and often along the surface of the water with shakespeares edgar she drinks the green mantle of the standing pool or at least seems to prefer those places where it is seen whether she makes pondweed her food or hunts among it for waterinsects which are found there in great abundance is not certain i have seen them when pondweed was taken out of their stomach she builds her nest upon low trees and shrubs of sticks and fibers by the water side her eggs are sharp at one end white with a tincture of green spotted with red she lays twice or thrice in a summer her young ones swim the moment they leave the egg pursue their parent and imitate all her manners she rears in this manner two or three broods in a season and when the young are grown up she drives them off to shift for themselves  as the coot is a larger bird it is always seen in larger streams and more remote from mankind the waterhen seems to prefer inhabited situations she keeps near ponds motes and pools of water near gentlemens houses but the coot keeps in rivers and among rushy margined lakes it there makes a nest of such weeds as the stream supplies and lays them among the reeds floating on the surface and rising and falling with the water the reeds among which it is built keep it fast so that it is seldom washed into the middle of the stream but if this happens which is sometimes the case the bird sits in her nest like a mariner in his boat and steers with her legs her cargo into the nearest harbor there having attained her port she continues to sit in great tranquillity regardless of the impetuosity of the current and though the water penetrates her nest she hatches her eggs in that wet condition  the waterhen never wanders but the coot sometimes swims down the current till it even reaches the sea in this voyage these birds encounter a thousand dangers as they cannot fly far they are hunted by dogs and men as they never leave the stream they are attacked and destroyed by otters they are preyed upon by kites and falcons and they are taken in still greater numbers in weirs made for catching fish for these birds are led into the nets while pursuing small fish and insects which are their principal food thus animated nature affords a picture of universal invasion man destroys the otter the otter destroys the coot the coot feeds upon fish and fish are universally the tyrants of each other  to these birds with long legs and finny toes i will add one species more with short legs and finny toes i mean the grebe the entire resemblance of this birds appetites and manners to those of the webfooted class might justly induce me to rank it among them but as it resembles those above described in the peculiar form of its toes and bears some similitude in its manners also i will for once sacrifice method to brevity the grebe is much larger than either of the former and its plumage white and black it differs also entirely in the shortness of its legs which are made for swimming and not walking in fact they are from the knee upward hid in the belly of the bird and have consequently very little motion by this mark and by the scolloped fringe of the toes may this bird be easily distinguished from all others  as they are thus from the shortness of their wings ill formed for flying and from the uncommon shortness of their legs utterly unfitted for walking they seldom leave the water and chiefly frequent those broad shallow pools where their faculty of swimming can be turned to the greatest advantage in fishing and seeking their prey  they are chiefly in this country seen to frequent the meres of shropshire and cheshire where they breed among reeds and flags in a floating nest kept steady by the weeds of the margin the female is said to be a careful nurse of its young being observed to feed them most assiduously with small eels and when the little brood is tired the mother will carry them either on her back or under her wings this bird preys upon fish and is almost perpetually diving it does not show much more than the head above water and is very difficult to be shot as it darts down on the appearance of the least danger it is never seen on land and though disturbed ever so often will not leave that lake where alone by diving and swimming it can find food and security it is chiefly sought for the skin of its breast the plumage of which is of a most beautiful silvery white and as glossy as satin this part is made into tippets but the skins are out of season about february losing their bright color and in breedingtime their breasts are entirely bare  part vi of waterfowl chap i of waterfowl in general in settling the distinctions among the other classes of birds there was some difficulty one tribe encroached so nearly upon the nature and habitudes of another that it was not easy to draw the line which kept them asunder but in waterfowl nature has marked them for us by a variety of indelible characters so that it would be almost as unlikely to mistake a landfowl for one adapted for living and swimming among the waters as a fish for a bird  the first great distinction in this class appears in the toes which are webbed together for swimming those who have remarked the feet or toes of a duck will easily conceive how admirably they are formed for making way in the water when men swim they do not open the fingers so as to let the fluid pass through them but closing them together present one broad surface to beat back the water and thus push their bodies along what man performs by art nature has supplied to waterfowl and by broad skins has webbed their toes together so that they expand two broad oars to the water and thus moving them alternately with the greatest ease paddle along we must observe also that the toes are so contrived that as they strike backward their broadest hollow surface beats the water but as they gather them in again for a second blow their front surface contracts and does not impede the birds progressive motion  as their toes are webbed in the most convenient manner so are their legs also made most fitly for swift progession in the water the legs of all are short except the three birds described in a former chapter namely the flamingo the avosetta and the corrira all which for that reason i have thought proper to rank among the crane kind as they make little use of their toes in swimming except these all webfooted birds have very short legs and these strike while they swim with greater facility were the leg long it would act like a lever whose prop is placed to a disadvantage its motions would be slow and the labor of moving it considerable for this reason the very few birds whose webbed feet are long never make use of them in swimming the web at the bottom seems only of service as a broad base to prevent them from sinking while they walk in the mud but it otherwise rather retards than advances their motion  the shortness of the legs in the webfooted kinds renders them as unfit for walking on land as it qualifies them for swimming in their natural element their stay therefore upon land is but short and transitory and they seldom venture to breed far from the sides of those waters where they usually remain in their breeding seasons their young are brought up by the waterside and they are covered with a warm down to fit them for the coldness of their situation the old ones also have a closer warmer plumage than birds of any other class it is of their feathers that our beds are composed as they neither mat nor imbibe humidity but are furnished with an animaloil that glazes their furface and keeps each separate in some however this animaloil is in too great abundance and is as offensive from its smell as it is serviceable for the purposes of household economy the feathers therefore of all the penguin kind are totally useless for domestic purposes as neither boiling nor bleaching can divest them of their oily rancidity indeed the rancidity of all new feathers of whatever waterfowl they be is so disgusting that our upholsterers give near double the price for old feathers that they afford for new to be free from smell they must all be lain upon for some time and their usual method is to mix the new and the old together  this quantity of oil with which most waterfowl are supplied contributes also to their warmth in the moist element where they reside their skin is generally lined with fat so that with the warmth of the feathers externally and this natural lining more internally they are better defended against the changes or the inclemencies of the weather than any other class whatever  as among landbirds there are some found fitted entirely for depredation and others for an harmless method of subsisting upon vegetables so also among these birds there are tribes of plunderers that prey not only upon fish but sometimes upon waterfowl themselves there are likewise more inoffensive tribes that live upon insects and vegetables only some waterfowls subsist by making sudden stoops from above to seize whatever fish come near the surface others again not furnished with wings long enough to fit them for flight take their prey by diving after it to the bottom  from hence all waterfowl naturally fall into three distinctions those of the gull kind that with long legs and round bills fly along the surface to seize their prey those of the penguin kind that with round bills legs hid in the abdomen and short wings dive after their prey and thirdly those of the goose kind with flat broad bills that lead harmless lives and chiefly subsist upon insects and vegetables  these are not speculative distinctions made up for the arrangement of a system but they are strongly and evidently marked by nature the gull kind are active and rapacious constantly except when they breed keeping upon the wing fitted for a life of rapine with sharp straight bills for piercing or hooked at the end for holding their fishy prey in this class we may rank the albatross the cormorant the gannet or soland goose the shag the frigate bird the great brown gull and all the lesser tribe of gulls and seaswallows  the penguin kind with appetites as voracious bills as sharp and equally eager for prey are yet unqualified to obtain it by flight their wings are short and their bodies large and heavy so that they can neither run nor fly but they are formed for diving in a very peculiar manner their feet are placed so far backward and their legs so hid in the abdomen that the slightest stroke sends them head foremost to the bottom of the water to this class we may refer the penguin the auk the skout the seaturtle the bottlenose and the loon  the goose kind are easily distinguishable by their flat broad bills covered with a skin and their manner of feeding which is mostly upon vegetables in this class we may place the swan the goose the duck the teal the widgeon and all their numerous varieties  in describing the birds of these three classes i will put the most remarkable of each class at the beginning of their respective tribes and give their separate history then after having described the chiefs of the tribe the more ordinary sorts will naturally fall in a body and come under a general description behind their leaders but before i offer to pursue this methodical arrangement i must give the history of a bird that from the singularity of its conformation seems allied to no species and should therefore be separately described i mean the pelican  depiction of the grebe the culterneb coulterneb puffin and the pelican   grebe   culterneb   pelican  de seve del isc tailor sculp   chap ii of the pelican the pelican of africa is much larger in the body than a swan and somewhat of the same shape and color its four toes are all webbed together and its neck in some measure resembles that of a swan but that singularity in which it differs from all other birds is in the bill and the great pouch underneath which are wonderful and demand a distinct description this enormous bill is fifteen inches from the point to the opening of the mouth which is a good way back behind the eyes at the base the bill is somewhat greenish but varies toward the end being of a reddish blue it is very thick in the beginning but tapers off to the end where it hooks downwards the underchap is still more extraordinary for to the lower edges of it hang a bag reaching the whole length of the bill to the neck which is said to be capable of containing fifteen quarts of water this bag the bird has a power of wrinkling up into the hollow of the underchap but by opening the bill and putting ones hand down into the bag it may be distended at pleasure the skin of which it is formed will then be seen of a bluish ash color with many fibers and veins running over its surface it is not covered with feathers but a short downy substance as smooth and as soft as satin and is attached all along the under edges of the chap to be fixed backward to the neck of the bird by proper ligaments and reaches near half way down when this bag is empty it is not seen but when the bird has fished with success it is then incredible to what an extent it is often seen dilated for the first thing the pelican does in fishing is to fill up the bag and then it returns to digest its burden at leisure when the bill is opened to its widest extent a person may run his head into the birds mouth and conceal it in this monstrous pouch thus adapted for very singular purposes yet this is nothing to what ruysch assures us who avers that a man has been seen to hide his whole leg boot and all in the monstrous jaws of one of these animals at first appearance this would seem impossible as the sides of the under chap from which the bag depends are not above an inch asunder when the birds bill is first opened but then they are capable of great separation and it must necessarily be so as the bird preys upon the largest fishes and hides them by dozens in its pouch tertre affirms that it will hide as many fish as will serve sixty hungry men for a meal  such is the formation of this extraordinary bird which is a native of africa and america the pelican was once also known in europe particularly in russia but it seems to have deserted our coasts this is the bird of which so many fabulous accounts have been propagated such as its feeding its young with its own blood and its carrying a provision of water for them in its great reservoir in the desert but the absurdity of the first account answers itself and as for the latter the pelican uses its bag for very different purposes than that of filling it with water  its amazing pouch may be considered as analogous to the crop in other birds with this difference that as theirs lies at the bottom of the gullet so this is placed at the top thus as pigeons and other birds macerate their food for their young in their crops and then supply them so the pelican supplies its young by a more ready contrivance and macerates their food in its bill or stores it for its own particular sustenance  the ancients were particularly fond of giving this bird admirable qualities and parental affections struck perhaps with its extraordinary figure they were willing to supply it with as extraordinary appetites and having found it with a large reservoir they were pleased with turning it to the most tender and parental uses but the truth is the pelican is a very heavy sluggish voracious bird and very ill fitted to take those flights or to make those cautious provisions for a distant time which we have been told they do father labat who seems to have studied their manners with great exactness has given us a minute history of this bird as found in america and from him i will borrow mine  the pelican says labat has strong wings furnished with thick plumage of an ash color as are the rest of the feathers over the whole body its eyes are very small when compared to the size of its head there is a sadness in its countenance and its whole air is melancholy it is as dull and reluctant in its motions as the flamingo is sprightly and active it is slow of flight and when it rises to fly performs it with difficulty and labor nothing as it would seem but the spur of necessity could make these birds change their situation or induce them to ascend into the air but they must either starve or fly  they are torpid and inactive to the last degree so that nothing can exceed their indolence but their gluttony it is only from the stimulations of hunger that they are excited to labor for otherwise they would continue always in fixed repose when they have raised themselves about thirty or forty feet above the surface of the sea they turn their head with one eye downwards and continue to fly in that posture as soon as they perceive a fish sufficiently near the surface they dart down upon it with the swiftness of an arrow seize it with unerring certainty and store it up in their pouch they then rise again though not without great labor and continue hovering and fishing with their head on one side as before  this work they continue with great effort and industry till their bag is full and then they fly to land to devour and digest at leisure the fruits of their industry this however it would appear they are not long performing for toward night they have another hungry call and they again reluctantly go to labor at night when their fishing is over and the toil of the day crowned with success these lazy birds retire a little way from the shore and though with the webbed feet and clumsy figure of a goose they will be contented to perch no where but upon trees among the light and airy tenants of the forest there they take their repose for the night and often spend a great part of the day except such times as they are fishing sitting in dismal solemnity and as it would seem half asleep their attitude is with the head resting upon their great bag and that resting upon their breast there they remain without motion or once changing their situation till the calls of hunger break their repose and till they find it indispensibly necessary to fill their magazine for a fresh meal thus their life is spent between sleeping and eating and our author adds that they are as foul as they are voracious as they are every moment voiding excrements in heaps as large as ones fist  the same indolent habits seem to attend them even in preparing for incubation and defending their young when excluded the female makes no preparation for her nest nor seems to choose any place in preference to lay in but drops her eggs on the bare ground to the number of five or six and there continues to hatch them attached to the place without any desire of defending her eggs or her young she tamely sits and suffers them to be taken from under her now and then she just ventures to peck or to cry out when a person offers to beat her off  she feeds her young with fish macerated for some time in her bag and when they cry flies off for a new supply labat tells us that he took two of these when very young and tied them by the leg to a post stuck into the ground where he had the pleasure of seeing the old one for several days come to feed them remaining with them the greatest part of the day and spending the night on the branch of a tree that hung over them by these means they were all three become so familiar that they suffered themselves to be handled and the young ones very kindly accepted whatever fish he offered them these they always put first into their bag and then swallowed at their leisure  it seems however that they are but disagreeable and useless domestics their gluttony can scarcely be satisfied their flesh smells very rancid and tastes a thousand times worse than it smells the native americans kill vast numbers not to eat for they are not fit even for the banquet of a savage but to convert their large bags into purses and tobaccopouches they bestow no small pains in dressing the skin with salt and ashes rubbing it well with oil and then forming it to their purpose it thus becomes so soft and pliant that the spanish women sometimes adorn it with gold and embroidery to make workbags of  yet with all the seeming hebetude of this bird it is not entirely incapable of instruction in a domestic state father raymond assures us that he has seen one so tame and well educated among the native americans that it would go off in the morning at the word of command and return before night to its master with its great paunch distended with plunder a part of which the savages would make it disgorge and a part they would permit it to reserve for itself  the pelican as faber relates is not destitute of other qualifications one of those which was brought alive to the duke of bavarias court where it lived forty years seemed to be possessed of very uncommon sensations it was much delighted in the company and conversation of men and in music both vocal and instrumental for it would willingly stand says he by those that sung or sounded the trumpet and stretching out its head and turning its ear to the music listened very attentively to its harmony though its own voice was little pleasanter than the braying of an ass gesner tells us that the emperor maximilian had a tame pelican which lived for above eighty years and that always attended his army on their march it was one of the largest of the kind and had a daily allowance by the emperors orders as another proof of the great age to which the pelican lives aldrovandus makes mention of one of these birds that was kept several years at mechlin and was verily believed to be fifty years old  we often see these birds at our shows about town  chap iii of the albatross the first of the gull kind though this is one of the largest and most formidable birds of africa and america yet we have but few accounts to enlighten us in its history the figure of the bird is thus described by edwards the body is rather larger than that of the pelican and its wings when extended ten feet from tip to tip the bill which is six inches long is yellowish and terminates in a crooked point the top of the head is of a bright brown the back is of a dirty deep spotted brown and the belly and under the wings is white the toes which are webbed are of a flesh color  such are the principal traits in this birds figure but these lead us a very short way in its history and our naturalists have thought fit to say nothing more however i am apt to believe this bird to be the same with that described by wicquefort under the title of the alcatraz its size its colors and its prey incline me to think so he describes it as a kind of great gull as large in the body as a goose of a brown color with a long bill and living upon fish of which they kill great numbers  this bird is an inhabitant of the tropical climates and also beyond them as far as the streights of magellan in the south seas it is one of the most fierce and formidable of the aquatic tribe not only living upon fish but also such small waterfowl as it can take by surprise it preys as all the gullkind do upon the wing and chiefly pursues the flyingfish that are forced from the sea by the dolphins the ocean in that part of the world presents a very different appearance from the seas with which we are surrounded in our seas we see nothing but a dreary expanse ruffled by winds and seemingly forsaken by every class of animated nature but the tropical seas and the distant southern latitudes beyond them are all alive with birds and fishes pursuing and pursued every various species of the gullkind are there seen hovering on the wing at a thousand miles distance from the shore the flying fish are every moment rising to escape from their pursuers of the deep only to encounter equal dangers in the air just as they rise the dolphin is seen to dart after them but generally in vain the gull has more frequent success and often takes them at their rise while the albatross pursues the gull and obliges it to relinquish its prey so that the whole horizon presents but one living picture of rapacity and evasion  so much is certain but how far we are to credit wicquefort in what he adds concerning this bird the reader is left to determine as these birds except when they breed live entirely remote from land so they are often seen as it should seem sleeping in the air at night when they are pressed by slumber they rise into the clouds as high as they can there putting their head under one wing they beat the air with the other and seem to take their ease after a time however the weight of their bodies only thus half supported brings them down and they are seen descending with a pretty rapid motion to the surface of the sea upon this they again put forth their efforts to rise and thus alternately ascend and descend at their ease but it sometimes happens says my author that in these slumbering flights they are off their guard and fall upon deck where they are taken  what truth there may be in this account i will not take it upon me to determine but certain it is that few birds float upon the air with more ease than the albatross or support themselves a longer time in that element they seem never to feel the accesses of fatigue but night and day upon the wing are always prowling yet always emaciated and hungry  but though this bird be one of the most formidable tyrants of the deep there are some associations which even tyrants themselves form to which they are induced either by caprice or necessity the albatross seems to have a peculiar affection for the penguin and a pleasure in its society they are always seen to choose the same places for breeding some distant uninhabited island where the ground slants to the sea as the penguin is not formed either for flying or climbing in such places their nests are seen together as if they stood in need of mutual assistance and protection captain hunt who for some time commanded at our settlement upon falkland islands assures me that he was often amazed at the union preserved between these birds and the regularity with which they built together in that bleak and desolate spot where the birds had long continued undisturbed possessors and no way dreaded the encroachments of men they seemed to make their abode as comfortable as they expected it to be lasting they were seen to build with an amazing degree of uniformity their nests covering fields by thousands and resembling a regular plantation in the middle on high the albatross raised its nest on heath sticks and long grass about two feet above the surface round this the penguins made their lower settlements rather in holes in the ground and most usually eight penguins to one albatross nothing is a stronger proof of mr buffons fine observation that the presence of man not only destroys the society of meaner animals but their instincts also these nests are now i am told totally destroyed the society is broke up and albatross and penguin have gone to breed upon more desert shores in greater security  chap iv the cormorant the cormorant is about the size of a large muscovy duck and may be distinguished from all other birds of this kind by its four toes being united by membranes together and by the middle toe being toothed or notched like a saw to assist it in holding its fishy prey the head and neck of this bird are of a sooty blackness and the body thick and heavy more inclining in figure to that of the goose than the gull the bill is straight till near the end where the upper chap bends into a hook  but notwithstanding the seeming heaviness of its make there are few birds more powerfully predaceous as soon as the winter approaches they are seen dispersed along the seashore and ascending up the mouths of fresh water rivers carrying destruction to all the finny tribe they are most remarkably voracious and have a most sudden digestion their appetite is for ever craving and never satisfied this gnawing sensation may probably be increased by the great quantity of small worms that fill their intestines and which their unceasing gluttony contributes to engender  thus formed with the grossest appetites this unclean bird has the most rank and disagreeable smell and is more foetid than even carrion when in its most healthful state its form says an ingenious modern is disagreeable its voice is hoarse and croaking and all its qualities obscene no wonder then that milton should make satan personate this bird when he sent him upon the basest purposes to survey with pain the beauties of paradise and to sit devising death on the tree of life vide penants zoology p      it has been remarked however of our poet that the making a waterfowl perch on a tree implied no great acquaintance with the history of nature in vindication of milton aristotle expressly says that the cormorant is the only waterfowl that sits on trees we have already seen the pelican of this number and the cormorants toes seem as fit for perching upon trees as for swimming so that our epic bard seems to have been as deeply versed in natural history as in criticism  indeed this bird seems to be of a multiform nature and wherever fish are to be found watches their migrations it is seen as well by land as sea it fishes in fresh water lakes as well as in the depths of the ocean it builds in the cliffs of rocks as well as on trees and preys not only in the daytime but by night  its indefatigable nature and its great power in catching fish were probably the motives that induced some nations to breed this bird up tame for the purposes of fishing and willoughby assures us it was once used in england for that purpose the description of their manner of fishing is thus delivered by faber when they carry them out of the rooms where they are kept to the fishpools they hoodwink them that they may not be frighted by the way when they are come to the rivers they take off their hoods and having tied a leather thong round the lower part of their necks that they may not swallow down the fish they catch they throw them into the river they presently dive under water and there for a long time with wonderful swiftness pursue the fish and when they have caught them rise to the top of the water and pressing the fish lightly with their bills swallow them till each bird has after this manner devoured five or six fishes then their keepers call them to the fist to which they readily fly and one after another vomit up all their fish a little bruised with the first nip given in catching them when they have done fishing setting the birds on some high place they loose the string from their necks leaving the passage to the stomach free and open and for their reward they throw them part of their prey to each one or two fishes which they will catch most dexterously as they are falling in the air  at present the cormorant is trained up in every part of china for the same purpose where there are many lakes and canals to this end says le comte they are educated as men rear up spaniels or hawks and one man can easily manage an hundred the fisher carries them out into the lake perched on the gunnel of his boat where they continue tranquil and expecting his orders with patience when arrived at the proper place at the first signal given each flies a different way to fulfill the task assigned it it is very pleasant on this occasion to behold with what sagacity they portion out the lake or the canal where they are upon duty they hunt about they plunge they rise an hundred times to the surface until they have at last found their prey they then seize it with their beak by the middle and carry it without fail to their master when the fish is too large they then give each other mutual assistance one seizes it by the head the other by the tail and in this manner carry it to the boat together there the boatman stretches out one of his long oars on which they perch and being delivered of their burden they fly off to pursue their sport when they are wearied he lets them rest for a while but they are never fed till their work is over in this manner they supply a very plentiful table but still their natural gluttony cannot be reclaimed even by education they have always while they fish the same string fastened round their throats to prevent them from devouring their prey as otherwise they would at once satiate themselves and discontinue their pursuit the moment they had filled their bellies  as for the rest the cormorant is the best fisher of all birds and though fat and heavy with the quantity it devours is nevertheless generally upon the wing the great activity with which it pursues and from a vast height drops down to dive after its prey offers one of the most amusing spectacles to those who stand upon a cliff on the shore this large bird is seldom seen in the air but where there are fish below but then they must be near the surface before it will venture to souse upon them if they are at a depth beyond what the impetus of its flight makes the cormorant capable of diving to they certainly escape him for this bird cannot move so fast under water as the fish can swim it seldom however makes an unsuccessful dip and is often seen rising heavily with a fish larger than it can readily devour it sometimes also happens that the cormorant has caught the fish by the tail and consequently the fins prevent its being easily swallowed in that position in this case the bird is seen to toss its prey above its head and very deterously to catch it when descending by the proper end and so swallow it with ease  chap v of the gannet or soland goose the gannet is of the size of a tame goose but its wings much longer being six feet over the bill is six inches long straight almost to the point where it inclines down and the sides are irregularly jagged that it may hold its prey with greater security it differs from the cormorant in size being larger in its color which is chiefly white and by its having no nostrils but in their place a long furrow that reaches almost to the end of the bill from the corner of the mouth is a narrow slip of black bare skin that extends to the hind part of the head beneath the skin is another that like the pouch of the pelican is dilatable and of size sufficient to contain five or six entire herrings which in the breeding season it carries at once to its mate or its young  these birds which subsist entirely upon fish chiefly resort to those uninhabited islands where their food is found in plenty and men seldom come to disturb them the islands to the north of scotland the skelig islands of the coasts of kerry in ireland and those that lie in the north sea off norway abound with them but it is on the bass island in the firth of edinburgh where they are seen in the greatest abundance there is a small island says the celebrated harvey called the bass not more than a mile in circumference the surface is almost wholly covered during the months of may and june with their nests their eggs and young it is scarcely possible to walk without treading on them the flocks of birds upon the wing are so numerous as to darken the air like a cloud and their noise is such that one cannot without difficulty be heard by the person next to him when one looks down upon the sea from the precipice its whole surface seems covered with infinite numbers of birds of different kinds swimming and pursuing their prey if in sailing round the island one surveys its hanging cliffs in every crag or fissure of the broken rocks may be seen innumerable birds of various sorts and sizes more than the stars of heaven when viewed in a serene night if they are viewed at a distance either receding or in their approach to the island they seem like one vast swarm of bees  they are not less frequent upon the rocks of st kilda martin assures us that the inhabitants of that small island consume annually near twentythree thousand young birds of this species besides an amazing quantity of their eggs on these they principally subsist throughout the year and from the number of these visitants make an estimate of their plenty for the season they preserve both the eggs and fowls in small pyramidal stone buildings covering them with turfashes to prevent the evaporation of their moisture  the gannet is a bird of passage in winter it seeks the more southern coasts of cornwall hovering over the shoals of herrings and pilchards that then come down from the northern seas its first appearance in the northern islands is in the beginning of spring and it continues to breed till the end of summer but in general its motions are determined by the migrations of the immense shoals of herrings that come pouring down at that season through the british channel and supply all europe as well as this bird with their spoil the gannet assiduously attends the shoal in their passage keeps with them in their whole circuit round our island and shares with our fishermen this exhaustless banquet as it is strong of wing it never comes near the land but is constant to its prey wherever the gannet is seen it is sure to announce to the fishermen the arrival of the finny tribe they then prepare their nets and take the herrings by millions at a draught while the gannet who came to give the first information comes though an unbidden guest and often snatches its prey from the fisherman even in his boat while the fishing season continues the gannets are busily employed but when the pilchards disappear from our coasts the gannet takes its leave to keep them company  the cormorant has been remarked for the quickness of his sight yet in this the gannet seems to exceed him it is possessed of a transparent membrane under the eyelid with which it covers the whole eye at pleasure without obscuring the sight in the smallest degree this seems a necessary provision for the security of the eyes of so weighty a creature whose method of taking prey like that of the cormorant is by darting headlong down from an height of an hundred feet and more into the water to seize it these birds are sometimes taken at sea by fastening a pilchard to a board which they leave floating the gannet instantly pounces down from above upon the board and is killed or maimed by the shock of a body where it expected no resistance  these birds breed but once a year and lay but one egg which being taken away they lay another if that is also taken then a third but never more for that season their egg is white and rather less than that of the common goose and their nest large composed of such substances as are found floating on the surface of the sea the young birds during the first year differ greatly in color from the old ones being of a dusky hue speckled with numerous triangular white spots and at that time resembling the colors of the speckled diver  the bass island where they chiefly breed belongs to one proprietor so that care is taken never to fright away the birds when laying or to shoot them upon the wing by that means they are so confident as to alight and feed their young ones close beside you they feed only upon fish as was observed yet the young gannet is counted a great dainty by the scots and sold very dear so that the lord of the islet makes a considerable annual profit by the sale  chap vi of smaller gulls and petrels having described the manners of the great ones of this tribe those of the smaller kinds may be easily inferred they resemble the more powerful in their appetites for prey but have not such certain methods of obtaining it in general therefore the industry of this tribe and their audacity increase in proportion to their imbecility the great gulls live at the most remote distance from man the smaller are obliged to reside wherever they can take their prey and to come into the most populous places when solitude can no longer grant them a supply in this class we may place the gull properly so called of which there are above twenty different kinds the petrel of which there are three and the sea swallow of which there are as many the gulls may be distinguished by an angular knob on the lowerchap the petrels by their wanting this knob and the seaswallow by their bills which are straight slender and sharp pointed they all however agree in their appetites and their places of abode  the gull and all its varieties is very well known in every part of the kingdom it is seen with a slowsailing flight hovering over rivers to prey upon the smaller kinds of fish it is seen following the plowman in fallow fields to pick up insects and when living animal food does not offer it has even been known to eat carrion and whatever else of the kind that offers gulls are found in great plenty in every place but it is chiefly round our boldest rockiest shores that they are seen in the greatest abundance it is there that the gull breeds and brings up its young it is there that millions of them are heard screaming with discordant notes for months together  those who have been much upon our coasts know that there are two different kinds of shores that which slants down to the water with a gentle declivity and that which rises with a precipitate boldness and seems set as a bulwark to repel the force of the invading deeps it is to such shores as these that the whole tribe of the gullkind resort as the rocks offer them a retreat for their young and the sea a sufficient supply it is in the cavities of these rocks of which the shore is composed that the vast variety of seafowls retire to breed in fafety the waves beneath that continually beat at the base often wear the shore into an impending boldness so that it seems to jut out over the water while the raging of the sea makes the place inaccessible from below these are the situations to which seafowl chiefly resort and bring up their young in undisturbed security  those who have never observed our boldest coasts have no idea of their tremendous sublimity the boasted works of art the highest towers and the noblest domes are but anthills when put in comparison the single cavity of a rock often exhibits a coping higher than the cieling of a gothic cathedral the face of the shore offers to the view a wall of massive stone ten times higher than our tallest steeples what should we think of a precipice three quarters of a mile in height and yet the rocks of st kilda are still higher what must be our awe to approach the edge of that impending height and to look down on the unfathomable vacuity below to ponder on the terrors of falling to the bottom where the waves that swell like mountains are scarcely seen to curl on the surface and the roar of an ocean a thousand leagues broad appears softer than the murmur of a brook it is in these formidable mansions that myriads of seafowls are for ever seen sporting flying in security down the depth half a mile beneath the feet of the spectator the crow and the chough avoid those frightful precipices they choose smaller heights where they are less exposed to the tempest it is the cormorant the gannet the tarrock and the terne that venture to these dreadful retreats and claim an undisturbed possession to the spectator from above those birds though some of them are above the size of an eagle seem scarce as large as a swallow and their loudest screaming is scarce perceptible  but the generality of our shores are not so formidable though they may rise two hundred fathom above the surface yet it often happens that the water forsakes the shore at the departure of the tide and leaves a noble and delightful walk for curiosity on the beach not to mention the variety of shells with which the sand is strewed the lofty rocks that hang over the spectators head and that seem but just kept from falling produce in him no unpleasing gloom if to this be added the fluttering the screaming and the pursuits of myriads of waterbirds all either intent on the duties of incubation or rouzed at the presence of a stranger nothing can compose a scene of more peculiar solemnity to walk along the shore when the tide is departed or to sit in the hollow of a rock when it is come in attentive to the various sounds that gather on every side above and below may raise the mind to its highest and noblest exertions the solemn roar of the waves swelling into and subsiding from the vast caverns beneath the piercing note of the gull the frequent chatter of the guillemot the loud note of the auk the scream of the heron and the hoarse deep periodical croaking of the cormorant all unite to furnish out the grandeur of the scene and turn the mind to him who is the essence of all sublimity  yet it often happens that the contemplation of a seashore produces ideas of an humbler kind yet still not unpleasing the various arts of these birds to seize their prey and sometimes to elude their pursuers their society among each other and their tenderness and care of their young produce gentler sensations it is ridiculous also now and then to see their various ways of imposing upon each other it is common enough for instance with the arctic gull to pursue the lesser gulls so long that they drop their excrements through fear which the hungry hunter quickly gobbles up before it ever reaches the water in breeding too they have frequent contests one bird who has no nest of her own attempts to dispossess another and put herself in the place this often happens among all the gullkind and i have seen the poor bird thus displaced by her more powerful invader sit near the nest in pensive discontent while the other seemed quite comfortable in her new habitation yet this place of preeminence is not easily obtained for the instant the invader goes to snatch a momentary sustenance the other enters upon her own and always ventures another battle before she relinquishes the justness of her claim the contemplation of a cliff thus covered with hatchingbirds affords a very agreeable entertainment and as they sit upon the ledges of the rocks one above another with their white breasts forward the whole groupe has not unaptly been compared to an apothecarys shop  these birds like all others of the rapacious kind lay but few eggs and hence in many places their number is daily seen to diminish the lessening of so many rapacious birds may at first sight appear a benefit to mankind but when we consider how many of the natives of our islands are sustained by their flesh either fresh or salted we shall find no satisfaction in thinking that those poor people may in time lose their chief support the gull in general as was said builds on the ledges of rocks and lays from one egg to three in a nest formed of long grass and seaweed most of the kind are fishy tasted with black stringy flesh yet the young ones are better food and of these with several other birds of the penguin kind the poor inhabitants of our northern islands make their wretched banquets they have been long used to no other food and even salted gull can be relished by those who know no better almost all delicacy is a relative thing and the man who repines at the luxuries of a wellserved table starves not for want but from comparison the luxuries of the poor are indeed coarse to us yet still they are luxuries to those ignorant of better and it is probable enough that a kilda or a feroe man may be found to exist outdoing apicius himself in consulting the pleasures of the table indeed if it be true that such meat as is the most dangerously earned is the sweetest no men can dine so luxuriously as these as none venture so hardly in the pursuit of a dinner in jacobsons history of the feroe islands we have an account of the method in which those birds are taken and i will deliver it in his own simple manner  it cannot be expressed with what pains and danger they take these birds in those high steep cliffs whereof many are two hundred fathoms high but there are men apt by nature and fit for the work who take them usually in two manners they either climb from below into these high promontories that are as steep as a wall or they let themselves down with a rope from above when they climb from below they have a pole five or six else long with an iron hook at the end which they that are below in the boat or on the cliff fasten unto the mans girdle helping him up thus to the highest place where he can get footing afterward they also help up another man and thus several climb up as high as possibly they can and where they find difficulty they help each other up by thrusting one another up with their poles when the first has taken footing he draws the other up to him by the rope fastened to his waste and so they proceed till they come to the place where the birds build they there go about as well as they can in those dangerous places the one holding the rope at one end and fixing himself to the rock the other going at the other end from place to place if it should happen that he chances to fall the other that stands firm keeps him up and helps him up again but if he passes safe he likewise fastens himself till the other has passed the same dangerous place also thus they go about the cliffs after birds as they please it often happens however the more is the pity that when one does not stand fast enough or is not sufficiently strong to hold up the other in his fall that they both fall down and are killed in this manner some do perish every year  mr peter clanson in his description of norway writes that there was anciently a law in that country that whosoever climbed so on the cliffs that he fell down and died if the body was found before burial his next kinsman should go the same way but if he durst not or could not do it the dead body was not then to be buried in sanctified earth as the person was too full of temerity and his own destroyer  when the fowlers are come in the manner aforesaid to the birds within the cliffs where people seldom come the birds are so tame that they take them with their hands for they will not readily leave their young but when they are wild they cast a net with which they are provided over them and entangle them therein in the mean time there lies a boat beneath in the sea wherein they cast the birds killed and in this manner they can in a short time fill a boat with fowl when it is pretty fair weather and there is good fowling the fowlers stay in the cliffs seven or eight days together for there are here and there holes in the rocks where they can safely rest and they have meat let down to them with a line from the top of the mountain in the mean time some go every day to them to fetch home what they have taken some rocks are so difficult that they can in no manner get unto them from below wherefore they seek to come down thereunto from above for this purpose they have a rope eighty or a hundred fathoms long made of hemp and three fingers thick the fowler makes the end of this fast about his waist and between his legs so that he can sit thereon and is thus let down with the fowling staff in his hand six men hold by the rope and let him easily down laying a large piece of wood on the brink of the rock upon which the rope glideth that it may not be worn to pieces by the hard and rough edge of the stone they have besides another small line that is fastened to the fowlers body on which he pulls to give them notice how they should let down the great rope either lower or higher or to hold still that he may stay in the place whereunto he is come here the man is in great danger because of the stones that are loosened from the cliff by the swinging of the rope and he cannot avoid them to remedy this in some measure he has usually on his head a seamans thick and shaggy cap which defends him from the blows of the stones if they be not too big and then it costeth him his life nevertheless they continually put themselves in that danger for the wretched bodys foodsake hoping in gods mercy and protection unto which the greatest part of them do devoutly recommend themselves when they go to work otherwise they say there is no other great danger in it except that it is a toilsome and artificial labor for he that has not learned to be so let down and is not used thereto is turned about with the rope so that he soon grows giddy and can do nothing but he that has learned the art considers it as a sport swings himself on the rope sets his feet against the rock casts himself some fathoms from thence and shoots himself to what place he will he knows where the birds are he undestands how to sit on the line in the air and how to hold the fowlingstaff in his hand striking therewith the birds that come or fly away and when there are holes in the rocks and it stretches itself out making underneath as a cieling under which the birds are he knows how to shoot himself in among them and there take firm footing there when he is in these holes he makes himself loose of the rope which he fastens to a crag of the rock that it may not slip from him to the outside of the cliff he then goes about in the rock taking the fowl either with his hands or with the fowlingstaff thus when he has killed as many birds as he thinks fit he ties them in a bundle and fastens them to a little rope giving a sign by pulling that they should draw them up when he has wrought thus the whole day and desires to get up again he sits once more upon the great rope giving a new sign that they should pull him up or else he works himself up climbing along the rope with his girdle full of birds it is also usual where there are not folks enough to hold the great rope for the fowler to drive a post sloping into the earth and to make a rope fast thereto by which he lets himself down without any bodys help to work in the manner aforesaid some rocks are so formed that the person can go into their cavities by land  these manners are more terrible and dangerous to see than to describe especially if one considers the steepness and height of the rocks it seeming impossible for a man to approach them much less to climb or descend in some places the fowlers are seen climbing where they can only fasten the ends of their toes and fingers not shunning such places though there be an hundred fathom between them and the sea it is a dear meat for these poor people for which they must venture their lives and many after long venturing do at last perish therein  when the fowl is brought home a part thereof is eaten fresh another part when there is much taken being hung up for winter provision the feathers are gathered to make merchandise of for other expenses the inhabitants get a great many of these fowls as god gives his blessing and fit weather when it is dark and hazy they take most for then the birds stay in the rocks but in clear weather and hot sunshine they seek the sea when they prepare to depart for the season they keep themselves most there sitting on the clifts toward the seaside where people get at them sometimes with boats and take them with fowlingstaves    such is the account of this historian but we are not to suppose that all the birds caught in this manner are of the gull kind on the contrary numbers of them are of the penguin kind auks puffins and guillemots these all come once a season to breed in these recesses and retire in winter to fish in more southern climates  chap vii of the penguin kind and first of the great magellanic penguin the gulls are long winged swift flyers that hover over the most extensive seas and dart down upon such fish as approach too near the surface the penguin kind are but ill fitted for flight and still less for walking every body must have seen the awkward manner in which a duck either wild or tame attempts to change place they must recollect with what softness and ease a gull or a kite waves its pinions and with what a coil and flutter the duck attempts to move them how many strokes it is obliged to give in order to gather a little air and even when it is thus raised how soon it is fatigued with the force of its exertions and obliged to take rest again but the duck is not in its natural state half so unweildy an animal as the whole tribe of the penguin kind their wings are much shorter more scantily furnished with quills and the whole pinion placed too forward to be usefully employed for this reason the largest of the penguin kind that have a thick heavy body to raise cannot fly at all their wings serve them rather as paddles to help them forward when they attempt to move swiftly and in a manner walk along the surface of the water even the smaller kinds seldom fly by choice they flutter their wings with the swiftest efforts without making way and though they have but a small weight of body to sustain yet they seldom venture to quit the water where they are provided with food and protection  as the wings of the penguin tribe are unfitted for flight their legs are still more aukwardly adapted for walking this whole tribe have all above the knee hid within the belly and nothing appears but two short legs or feet as some would call them that seem stuck under the rump and upon which the animal is very aukwardly supported they seem when siting or attempting to walk like a dog that has been taught to sit up or to move a minuet their short legs drive the body in progression from side to side and were they not assisted by their wings they could scarcely move faster than a tortoise  this awkward position of the legs which so unqualifies them for living upon land adapts them admirably for a residence in water in that the legs placed behind the moving body pushes it forward with greater velocity and these birds like indian canoes are the swiftest in the water by having their paddles in the rear our sailors for this reason give these birds the very homely but expressive name of arsefeet  nor are they less qualified for diving than swimming by ever so little inclining their bodies forward they lose their center of gravity and every stroke from their feet only tends to sink them the faster in this manner they can either dive at once to the bottom or swim between two waters where they continue fishing for some minutes and then ascending catch an instantaneous breath to descend once more to renew their operations hence it is that these birds which are so defenseless and so easily taken by land are impregnable by water if they perceive themselves pursued in the least they instantly sink and show nothing more than their bills till the enemy is withdrawn their very internal conformation assists their power of keeping long under water their lungs are fitted with numerous vacuities by which they can take in a very large inspiration and this probably serves them for a length of time  as they never visit land except when they come to breed their feathers take a color from their situation that part of them which has been continually bathed in the water is white while their backs and wings are of different colors according to the different species they are also covered more warmly all over the body with feathers than any other birds whatever so that the sea seems entirely their element and but for the necessary duties of propagating the species we should scarcely have the smallest opportunity of seeing them and should be utterly unacquainted with their history  of all this tribe the magellanic penguin is the largest and the most remarkable in size it approaches near that of a tame goose it never flies as its wings are very short and covered with stiff hard feathers and are always seen expanded and hanging uselesly down by the birds sides the upper part of the head back and rump are covered with stiff black feathers while the belly and breast as is common with all of this kind are of a snowy whiteness except a line of black that is seen to cross the crop the bill which from the base to about half way is covered with wrinkles is black but marked crosswise with a stripe of yellow they walk erect with their heads on high their finlike wings hanging down like arms so that to see them at a distance they look like so many children with white aprons from hence they are said to unite in themselves the qualities of men fowls and fishes like men they are upright like fowls they are feathered and like fishes they have finlike instruments that beat the water before and serve for all the purposes of swimming rather than flying  they feed upon fish and seldom come ashore except in the breedingseason as the seas in that part of the world abound with a variety they seldom want food and their extreme fatness seems a proof of the plenty in which they live they dive with great rapidity and are voracious to a great degree one of them described by clusius though but very young would swallow an entire herring at a mouthful and often three successively before it was appeased in consequence of this gluttonous appetite their flesh is rank and fishy though our sailors say that it is pretty good eating in some the flesh is so tough and the feathers so thick that they stand the blow of a scymitar without injury  they are a bird of society and especially when they come on shore they are seen drawn up in rank and file upon the ledge of a rock standing together with the albatross as if in consulation this is previous to their laying which generally begins in that part of the world in the month of november their preparations for laying are attended with no great trouble as a small depression in the earth without any other nest serves for this purpose the warmth of their feathers and the heat of their bodies is such that the progress of incubation is carried on very rapidly  but there is a difference in the manner of this birds nestling in other countries which i can only ascribe to the frequent disturbances it has received from man or quadrupedes in its recesses in some places instead of contenting itself with a superficial depression in the ground the penguin is found to burrow two or three yards deep in other places it is seen to forsake the level and to clamber up the ledge of a rock where it lays its egg and hatches it in that bleak exposed situation these precautions may probably have been taken in consequence of dear bought experience in those countries where the bird fears for her own safety or that of her young she may providentially provide against danger by digging or even by climbing for both which she is but ill adapted by nature in those places however where the penguin has had but few visits from man her nest is made with the most confident security in the middle of some large plain where they are seen by thousands in that unguarded situation neither expecting nor fearing a powerful enemy they continue to sit brooding and even when man comes among them have at first no apprehension of their danger some of this tribe have been called by our seamen the booby from the total insensibility which they show when they are sought to their destruction but it is not considered that these birds have never been taught to know the dangers of an human enemy it is against the fox or the vulture that they have learned to defend themselves but they have no idea of injury from a being so very unlike their natural opposers the penguins therefore when our seamen first came among them tamely suffered themselves to be knocked on the head without even attempting an escape they have stood to be shot at in flocks without offering to move in silent wonder till every one of their number has been destroyed their attachment to their nests was still more powerful for the females tamely suffered the men to approach and take their eggs without any resistance but the expeperience of a few of those unfriendly visits has long since taught them to be more upon their guard in choosing their situations or to leave those retreats where they were so little able to oppose their invaders  the penguin lays but one egg and in frequented shores is found to burrow like a rabbit sometimes three or four take possession of one hole and hatch their young together in the holes of the rocks where nature has made them a retreat several of this tribe as linnaeus assures us are seen together there the females lay their single egg in a common nest and sit upon this their general possession by turns while one is placed as a sentinel to give warning of approaching danger the egg of the penguin as well as of all this tribe is very large for the size of the bird being generally found bigger than that of a goose but as there are many varieties of the penguin and as they differ in size from that of a muscovy duck to a swan the eggs differ in the same proportion  chap viii of the auk puffin and other birds of the penguin kind of a size far inferior to the penguin but with nearly the same form and exactly of the same appetites and manners there is a very numerous tribe these frequent our shores and like the penguin have their legs placed behind they have short wings which are not totally incapable of flight with round bills for seizing their prey which is fish they live upon the water in which they are continually seen diving and seldom venture upon land except for the purposes of continuing their kind  the first of this smaller tribe is the great northern diver which is nearly of the size of a goose it is beautifully variegated all over with many stripes and differs from the penguin in being much slenderer and more elegantly formed the gray speckled diver does not exceed the size of a muscovy duck and except in size greatly resembles the former the auk which breeds on the islands of st kilda and chiefly differs from the penguin in size and color it is smaller than a duck and the whole of the breast and belly as far as the middle of the throat is white the guillemot is about the same size it differs from the auk in having a longer a slenderer and a straighter bill the scarlet throated diver may be distinguished by its name and the puffin or coulterneb is one of the most remarkable birds we know  words cannot easily describe the form of the bill of the puffin which differs so greatly from that of any other bird those who have seen the coulter of a plough may form some idea of the beak of this oddlooking animal the bill is flat but very different from that of the duck its edge is upwards it is of a triangular figure and ending in a sharp point the upper chap bent a little downward where it is joined to the head and a certain callous substance encompassing its base as in parrots it is of two colors ashcolored near the base and red toward the point it has three furrows or groves impressed in it one in the livid part two in the red the eyes are fenced with a protuberant skin of a lividcolour and they are gray or ashcolored these are marks sufficient to distinguish this bird by but its value to those in whose vicinity it breeds renders it still more an object of curiosity  the puffin like all the rest of this kind has its legs thrown so far back that it can hardly move without tumbling this makes it rise with difficulty and subject to many falls before it gets upon the wing but as it is a small bird not much bigger than a pigeon when it once rises it can continue its flight with great celerity  both this and all the former build no nest but lay their eggs either in the crevices of rocks or in holes under ground near the shore they chiefly choose the latter situation for the puffin the auk the guillemot and the rest cannot easily rise to the nest when in a lofty situation many are the attempts these birds are seen to make to fly up to those nests which are so high above the surface in rendering them inaccessible to mankind they often render them almost inaccessible to themselves they are frequently obliged to make three or four efforts before they can come at the place of incubation for this reason the auk and guillemot when they have once laid their single egg which is extremely large for the size seldom forsake it until it is excluded the male who is better furnished for flight feeds the female during this interval and so bare is the place where she sits that the egg would often roll down from the rock did not the body of the bird support it  but the puffin seldom chooses these inaccessible and troublesome heights for its situation relying on its courage and the strength of its bill with which it bites most terribly it either makes or finds a hole in the ground where to lay and bring forth its young all the winter these birds like the rest are absent visiting regions too remote for discovery at the latter end of march or the beginning of april come over a troop of their spies or harbingers that stay two or three days as it were to view and search out for their former situations and see whether all be well this done they once more depart and about the beginning of may return again with the whole army of their companions but if the season happens to be stormy and tempestuous and the sea troubled the unfortunate voyagers undergo incredible hardships and they are found by hundreds cast away upon the shores lean and perished with famine willoughbys ornith p      it is most probable therefore that this voyage is performed more on the water than in the air and as they cannot fish in stormy weather their strength is exhausted before they can arrive at their wishedfor harbor  the puffin when it prepares for breeding which always happens a few days after its arrival begins to scrape up an hole in the ground not far from the shore and when it has some way penetrated the earth it then throws itself upon its back and with bill and claws thus burrows inward till it has dug a hole with several windings and turnings from eight to ten feet deep it particularly seeks to dig under a stone where it expects the greatest security in this fortified retreat it lays one egg which though the bird be not much bigger than a pigeon is of the size of a hen  when the young ones excluded the parents industry and courage is incredible few birds or beasts will venture to attack them in their retreats when the great searaven as jacobson informs us comes to take away their young the puffins boldly oppose him their meeting affords a most singular combat as soon as the raven approaches the puffin catches him under the throat with its beak and sticks its claws into his breast which makes the raven with a loud screaming attempt to get away but the little bird still holds fast to the invader nor lets him go till they both come to the sea where they drop down together and the raven is drowned yet the raven is but too often successful and invading the puffin at the bottom of its hole devours both the parent and its family  but were a punishment to be inflicted for immorality in irrational animals the puffin is justly a sufferer from invasion as it is often itself one of the most terrible invaders near the isle of anglesey in an islet called priesholm their flocks may be compared for multitude to swarms of bees in another islet called the calf of man a bird of this kind but of a different species is seen in great abundance in both places numbers of rabbits are found to breed but the puffin unwilling to be at the trouble of making a hole when there is one ready made dispossesses the rabbits and it is not unlikely destroys their young it is in these unjustly acquired retreats that the young puffins are found in great numbers and become a very valuable acquisition to the natives of the place the old ones i am now speaking of the manks puffin early in the morning at break of day leave their nests and young and even the island nor do they return till nightfall all this time they are diligently employed in fishing for their young so that their retreats on land which in the morning were loud and clamorous are now still and quiet with not a wing stirring till the approach of dusk when their screams once more announce their return whatever fish or other food they have procured in the day by night begins to suffer a kind of half digestion and is reduced to an oily matter which is ejected from the stomach of the old ones into the mouth of the young by this they are nourished and become fat to an amazing degree when they are arrived to their full growth they who are entrusted by the lord of the island draw them from their holes and that they may more readily keep an account of the number they take cut off one foot as a token their flesh is said to be excessively rank as they feed upon fish especially sprats and seaweed however when they are pickled and preserved with spices they are admired by those who are fond of high eating we are told that formerly their flesh was allowed by the church on lenten days they were at that time also taken by ferrets as we do rabbits at present they are either dug out or drawn out from their burrows with an hooked stick they bite extremely hard and keep such fast hold of whatsoever they seize upon as not to be easily disengaged their noise when taken is very disagreeable being like the efforts of a dumb person attempting to speak  the constant depredation which these birds annually suffer does not in the least seem to intimidate them or drive them away on the contrary as the people say the nest must be robbed or the old ones will breed there no longer all birds of this kind lay but one egg yet if that be taken away they will lay another and so on to a third which seems to imply that robbing their nests does not much intimidate them from laying again those however whose nests have been thus destroyed are often too late in bringing up their young who if they be not fledged and prepared for migration when all the rest depart are left at land to shift for themselves in august the whole tribe is seen to take leave of their summer residence nor are they observed any more till the return of the ensuing spring it is probable that they sail away to more southern regions as our mariners frequently see myriads of waterfowl upon their return and steering usually to the north indeed the coldest countries seem to be their most favored retreats and the number of waterfowl is much greater in those colder climates than in the warmer regions near the line the quantity of oil which abounds in their bodies serves as a defense against cold and preserves them in vigor against its severity but the same provision of oil is rather detrimental in warm countries as it turns rancid and many of them die of disorders which arise from its putrefaction in general however waterfowl can be properly said to be of no climate the element upon which they live being their proper residence they necessarily spend a few months of summer upon land to bring up their young but the rest of their time is probably consumed in their migrations or near some unknown coasts where their provision of fish is found in greatest abundance  before i go to the third general division of waterfowls it may not be improper to observe that there is one species of round billed waterfowl that does not properly lie within any of the former distributions this is the gooseander a bird with the body and wing shaped like those of the penguin kind but with legs not hid in the belly it may be distinguished from all others by its bill which is round hooked at the point and toothed both upper and under chap like a saw its colors are various and beautiful however its manners and appetites entirely resemble those of the diver it feeds upon fish for which it dives and is said to build its nest upon trees like the heron and the cormorant it seems to form the shade between the penguin and the goose kind having a round bill like the one and unembarrassed legs like the other in the shape of the head neck and body it resembles them both  chap ix of birds of the goose kind properly so called the swan the goose and the duck are leaders of a numerous useful and beautiful tribe of birds that we have reclaimed from a state of nature and have taught to live in dependence about us to describe any of these would be as superfluous as definitions usually are when given of things with which we are already well acquainted there are few that have not had opportunities of seeing them and whose ideas would not anticipate our description but though nothing be so easy as to distinguish these in general from each other yet the largest of the duckkind approach the goose so nearly that it may be proper to mark the distinctions  the marks of the goose are a bigger body large wings a longer neck a white ring about the rump a bill thicker at the base slenderer toward the tip with shorter legs placed more forward on the body they both have a wadling walk but the duck from the position of its legs has it in a greater degree by these marks these similar tribes may be known asunder and though the duck should be found to equal the goose in size which sometimes happens yet there are still other sufficient distinctions  but they all agree in many particulars and have a nearer affinity to each other than the neighboring kinds in any other department their having been tamed has produced alterations in each by which they differ as much from the wild ones of their respective kinds as they do among themselves there is nearly as much difference between the wild and the tame duck as between some sorts of the duck and the goose but still the characteristics of the kind are strongly marked and obvious and this tribe can never be mistaken  the bill is the first great obvious distinction of the goosekind from all of the feathered tribe in other birds it is round and wedgelike or crooked at the end in all the goose kind it is flat and broad made for the purposes of skimming ponds and lakes of the mantling weeds that stand on the surface the bills of other birds are made of an horny substance throughout these have their inoffensive bills sheathed with a skin which covers them all over the bill of every other bird seems in some measure formed for piercing or tearing theirs are only fitted for shoveling up their food which is chiefly of the vegetable kind  though these birds do not reject animal food when offered them yet they can contentedly subsist upon vegetables and seldom seek any other they are easily provided for wherever there is water there seems to be plenty all the other webfooted tribes are continually voracious continually preying these lead more harmless lives the weeds on the surface of the water or the insects at the bottom the grass by the bank or the fruits and corn in cultivated grounds are sufficient to satisfy their easy appetites yet these like every other animal will not reject flesh if properly prepared for them it is sufficient praise to them that they do not eagerly pursue it  as their food is chiefly vegetables so their fecundity is in proportion we have had frequent opportunities to observe that all the predatory tribes whether of birds or quadrupedes are barren and unfruitful we have seen the lion with its two cubs the eagle with the same number and the penguin with even but one nature that has supplied them with powers of destruction has denied them fertility but it is otherwise with these harmless animals i am describing they seem formed to fill up the chasms in animated nature caused by the voraciousness of others they breed in great abundance and lead their young to the pool the instant they are excluded  as their food is simple so their flesh is nourishing and wholesome the swan was considered as a high delicacy among the ancients the goose was abstained from as totally indigestible modern manners have inverted tastes the goose is now become the favorite and the swan is seldom brought to table unless for the purposes of ostentation but at all times the flesh of the duck was in high esteem the ancients thought even more highly of it than we do we are contented to eat it as a delicacy they also considered it as a medicine and plutarch assures us that cato kept his whole family in health by feeding them with duck whenever they threatened to be out of order  these qualities of great fecundity easy sustenance and wholesome nourishment have been found so considerable as to induce man to take these birds from a state of nature and render them domestic how long they have been thus dependants upon his pleasures is not known for from the earliest accounts they were considered as familiars about him the time must have been very remote for there have been many changes wrought in their colors their figures and even their internal parts by human cultivation the different kinds of these birds in a wild state are simple in their colorings when one has seen a wild goose or a wild duck a description of its plumage will to a feather exactly correspond with that of any other but in the tame kinds no two of any species are exactly alike different in their size their colors and frequently in their general form they seem the mere creatures of art and having been so long dependant upon man for support they seem to assume forms entirely suited to his pleasures or necessities  chap x of the swan tame and wild no bird makes a more indifferent figure upon land or a more beautiful one in the water than the swan when it ascends from its favorite element its motions are awkward and its neck is stretched forward with an air of stupidity but when it is seen smoothly sailing along the water commanding a thousand graceful attitudes moving at pleasure without the smallest effort when it proudly rows its state as milton has it with arched neck between its white wings mantling there is not a more beautiful figure in all nature in the exhibition of its form there are no broken or harsh lines no constrained or catching motions but the roundest contours and the easiest transitions the eye wanders over every part with insatiable pleasure and every part takes a new grace with new motion  this fine bird has long been rendered domestic and it is now a doubt whether there be any of the tame kind in a state of nature the wild swan though so strongly resembling this in color and form is yet a different bird for it is very differently formed within the wild swan is less than the tame by almost a fourth for as the one weighs twenty pounds the other only weighs sixteen pounds and three quarters the color of the tame swan is all over white that of the wild bird is along the back and the tips of the wings of an ash color but these are slight differences compared to what are found upon dissection in the tame swan the windpipe sinks down into the lungs in the ordinary manner but in the wild after a strange and wonderful contortion like what we have seen in the crane it enters through a hole formed in the breast bone and being reflected therein returns by the same aperture and being contracted into a narrow compass by a broad and bony cartilage it is divided into two branches which before they enter the lungs are dilated and as it were swolen out into two cavities  such is the extraordinary difference between these two animals which externally seem to be of one species whether it is in the power of long continued captivity and domestication to produce this strange variety between birds otherwise the same i will not take upon me to determine but certain it is that our tame swan is no where to be found at least in europe in a state of nature  as it is not easy to account for this difference of conformation so it is still more difficult to reconcile the accounts of the ancients with the experience of the moderns concerning the vocal powers of this bird the tame swan is one of the most silent of all birds and the wild one has a note extremely loud and disagreeable it is probable the convolutions of the windpipe may contribute to increase the clangor of it for such is the harshness of its voice that the bird from thence has been called the hooper in neither is there the smallest degree of melody nor have they for above this century been said to give specimens of the smallest musical abilities yet notwithstanding this it was the general opinion of antiquity that the swan was a most melodious bird and that even to its death its voice went on improving it would show no learning to produce what they have said upon the music of the swan it has already been collected by aldrovandus and still more professedly by the abbe gedoyn in the transactions of the academy of belles lettres from these accounts it appears that while plato aristotle and diodorus siculus believed the vocality of the swan pliny and virgil seem to doubt that received opinion in this equipoise of authority aldrovandus seems to have determined in favor of the greek philosophers and the form of the windpipe in the wild swan so much resembling a musical instrument inclined his belief still more strongly in aid of this also came the testimony of pendasius who affirmed that he had often heard swans sweetly singing in the lake of mantua as he was rowed up and down in a boat as also of olaus wormius who professed that many of his friends and scholars had heard them singing there was says he in my family a very honest young man john rostorph a student in divinity and a norwegian by nation this man did upon his credit and with the interposition of an oath solemnly affirm that once in the territory of dronten as he was standing on the sea shore early in the morning he heard an unusual and sweet murmur composed of most pleasant whistlings and sounds he knew not at first whence they came or how they were made for he saw no man near to produce them but looking round about him and climbing to the top of a certain promontory he there espied an infinite number of swans gathered together in a bay and making the most delightful harmony a sweeter in all his lifetime he had never heard these were accounts sufficient at least to keep opinion in suspense though in contradiction to our own experience but aldrovandus to put as he supposed the question past all doubt gives us the testimony of a countryman of our own from whom he had the relation this honest mans name was mr george braun who assured him that nothing was more common in england than to hear swans sing that they were bred in great numbers in the sea near london and that every fleet of ships that returned from their voyages from distant countries were met by swans that came joyfully out to welcome their return and salute them with a loud and cheerful singing it was in this manner that aldrovandus that great and good man was frequently imposed upon by the designing and the needy his unbounded curiosity drew round him people of every kind and his generosity was as ready to reward falsehood as truth  poor aldrovandus after having spent a vast fortune for the purposes of enlightening mankind after having collected more truth and more falseshood than any man ever did before him he little thought of being reduced at last to want bread to feel the ingratitude of his country and to die a beggar in a public hospital  thus it appears that our modern authorities in favor of the singing of swans are rather suspicious since they are reduced to this mr george braun and john rostorph the native of a country remarkable for ignorance and credulity it is probable the ancients had some mythological meaning in ascribing melody to the swan and as for the moderns they scarce deserve our regard the swan therefore must be content with that share of fame which it possesses on the score of its beauty since the melody of its voice without better testimony will scarcely be admitted by even the credulous  this beautiful bird is as delicate in its appetites as elegant in its form its chief food is corn bread herbs growing in the water and roots and seeds which are found near the margin it prepares a nest in some retired part of the bank and chiefly where there is an islet in the stream this is composed of waterplants long grass and sticks and the male and female assist in forming it with great assiduity the swan lays seven or eight eggs white much larger than those of a goose with a hard and sometimes a tuberous shell it sits near two months before its young are excluded which are ashcolored when they first leave the shell and for some months after it is not a little dangerous to approach the old ones when their little family are feeding round them their fears as well as their pride seems to take the alarm and they have sometimes been known to give a blow with their pinion that has broke a mans leg or arm  it is not till they are a twelvemonth old that the young swans change their color with their plumage all the stages of this birds approach to maturity are slow and seem to mark its longevity it is two months hatching a year in growing to its proper size and if according to plinys observation that those animals that are longest in the womb are the longest lived the swan is the longest in the shell of any bird we know and is said to be remarkable for its longevity some say that it lives three hundred years and willoughby who is in general diffident enough seems to believe the report a goose as he justly observes has been known to live an hundred and the swan from its superior size and from its harder firmer flesh may naturally be supposed to live still longer  swans were formerly held in such great esteem in england that by an act of edward the fourth none except the son of the king was permitted to keep a swan unless possessed of five marks a year by a subsequent act the punishment for taking their eggs was imprisonment for a year and a day and a fine at the kings will at present they are but little valued for the delicacy of their flesh but many are still preserved for their beauty we see multitudes on the thames and trent but no where greater numbers than on the salt water inlet of the sea near abbotsberry in dorsetshire  chap xi of the goose and its varieties the goose in its domestic state exhibits a variety of colors the wild goose always retains the same marks the whole upper part is ashcolored the breast and belly are of a dirty white the bill is narrow at the base and at the tip it is black the legs are of a saffron color and the claws black these marks are seldom found in the tame whose bill is entirely red and whose legs are entirely brown the wild goose is rather less than the tame but both invariably retain a white ring round their tail which shows that they are both descended from the same original  the wild goose is supposed to breed in the northern parts of europe and in the beginning of winter to descend into more temperate regions they are often seen flying at very great heights in flocks from fifty to an hundred and seldom resting by day their cry is frequently heard when they are at an imperceptible distance above us and this seems bandied from one to the other as among hounds in the pursuit whether this be the note of mutual encouragement or the necessary consequence of respiration is doubtful but they seldom exert it when they alight in these journies  upon their coming to the ground by day they range themselves in a line like cranes and seem rather to have descended for rest than for other refreshment when they have sat in this manner for an hour or two i have heard one of them with a loud long note sound a kind of charge to which the rest punctually attended and they pursued their journey with renewed alacrity their flight is very regularly arranged they either go in a line abreast or in two lines joining in an angle in the middle i doubt whether the form of their flight be thus arranged to cut the air with greater ease as is commonly believed i am more apt to think it is to present a smaller mark to fowlers from below a bullet might easily reach them if huddled together in a flock and the same discharge might destroy several at once but by their manner of flying no shot from below can affect above one of them and from the height at which they fly this is not easy to be hit  the barnacle differs in some respects from both these being less than either with a black bill much shorter than either of the preceding it is scarce necessary to combat the idle error of this birds being bred from a shell sticking to ships bottoms it is well known to be hatched from an egg in the ordinary manner and to differ in very few particulars from all the rest of its kind  the brent goose is still less than the former and not bigger than a muscovy duck except that the body is longer the head neck and upper part of the breast are black but about the middle of the neck on each side are two small spots or lines of white which together appear like a ring  these and many other varieties are found in this kind which agree in one common character of feeding upon vegetables and being remarkable for their fecundity of these however the tame goose is the most fruitful having less to fear from its enemies leading a securer and a more plentiful life its prolific powers increase in proportion to its ease and though the wild goose seldom lays above eight eggs the tame goose is often seen to lay above twenty the female hatches her eggs with great assiduity while the gander visits her twice or thrice a day and sometimes drives her off to take her place where he sits with great state and composure  but beyond that of all animals is his pride when the young are excluded he seems then to consider himself as a champion not only obliged to defend his young but also to keep off the suspicion of danger he pursues dogs and men that never attempt to molest him and though the most harmless thing alive is then the most petulant and provoking when in this manner he has pursued the calf or the mastiff to whose contempt alone he is indebted for safety he returns to his female and her brood in triumph clapping his wings screaming and showing all the marks of conscious superiority it is probable however these arts succeed in raising his importance among the tribe where they are displayed and it is probable there is not a more respectable animal on earth to a goose than a gander  a young goose is generally reckoned very good eating yet the feathers of this bird still farther increase its value i feel my obligations to this animal every word i write for however deficient a mans head may be his pen is nimble enough upon every occasion it is happy indeed for us that it requires no great effort to put it in motion but the feathers of this bird are still as valuable in another capacity as they make the softest and the warmest beds to sleep on  of goosefeathers most of our beds in europe are composed in the countries bordering on the levant and in all asia the use of them is utterly unknown they there use matrasses stuffed with wool or camels hair or cotton and the warmth of their climate may perhaps make them dispense with cushions of a softer kind but how it happens that the ancients had not the use of featherbeds is to me surprising pliny tell us indeed that they made bolsters of feathers to lay their heads on and this serves as a proof that they turned feathers to no other uses  as feathers are a very valuable commodity great numbers of geese are kept tame in the fens in lincolnshire which are plucked once or twice a year these make a considerable article of commerce the feathers of somersetshire are most in esteem those of ireland are reckoned the worst hudsons bay also furnishes very fine feathers supposed to be of the goose kind the down of the swan is brought from dantzic the same place also sends us great quantities of the feathers of the cock and hen but greenland iceland and norway furnish the best feathers of all and in this number we may reckon the eider down of which we shall take notice in its place the best method of curing feathers is to lay them in a room in an open exposure to the sun and when dried to put them into bags and beat them well with poles to get the dust off but after all nothing will prevent for a time the heavy smell which arises from the putrefaction of the oil contained in every feather no exposure will draw this off how long soever it be continued they must be lain upon which is the only remedy and for this reason old feathers are much more valuable than new  chap xii of the duck and its varieties the tame duck is the most easily reared of all our domestic animals the very instincts of the young ones direct them to their favorite element and though they are conducted by a hen yet they despise the admonitions of their leader  this serves as an incontestible proof that all birds have their manners rather from nature than education a falcon pursues the partridge not because it is taught by the old one but because its appetites make their importunate call for animal food the cuckoo follows a very different trade from that which its nurse endeavored to teach it and if we may credit pliny in time destroys its instructor animals of the duck kind also follow their appetites not their tutor and come to all their various perfections without any guide all the arts possessed by man are the result of accumulated experience all the arts of inferior animals are selftaught and scarce one acquired by imitation  it is usual with the good women to lay duckeggs under a hen because she hatches them better than the original parent would have done the duck seems to be an heedless inattentive mother she frequently leaves her eggs till they spoil and even seems to forget that she is entrusted with the charge she is equally regardless of them when excluded she leads them to the pond and thinks she has sufficiently provided for her offspring when she has shown them the water whatever advantages may be procured by coming near the house or attending in the yard she declines them all and often lets the vermin who haunt the waters destroy them rather than bring them to take shelter nearer home the hen is a nurse of a very opposite character she broods with the utmost assiduity and generally brings forth a young one from every egg committed to her charge she does not lead her younglings to the water indeed but she watchfully guards them when there by standing at the brink should the rat or the weazle attempt to seize them the hen can give them protection she leads them to the house when tired with padling and rears up the suppositious brood without ever suspecting that they belong to another  the wild duck differs in many respects from the tame and in them there is still greater variety than among the domestic kinds of the tame duck there are not less than ten different sorts and of the wild brisson reckons above twenty the most obvious distinction between wild and tame ducks is in the color of their feet those of the tame duck being black those of the wild duck yellow the difference between wild ducks among each other arises as well from their size as the nature of the place they feed in seaducks which feed in the saltwater and dive much have a broad bill bending upwards a large hind toe and a long blunt tail pondducks which feed in plashes have a straight and narrow bill a small hind toe and a sharp pointed train the former are called by our decoymen foreign ducks the latter are supposed to be natives of england it would be tedious to enter into the minute varieties of such a number of birds all agreeing in the same general figure the same habits and mode of living and differing in little more than their size and the colors of their plumage in this tribe we may rank as natives of our own european dominions the eider duck which is double the size of a common duck with a black bill the velvet duck not so large and with a yellow bill the scoter with a knob at the base of a yellow bill the tufted duck adorned with a thick crest the scaup duck less than the common duck with the bill of a greyish blue color the golden eye with a large white spot at the corners of the mouth resembling an eye the sheldrake with the bill of a bright red and swelling into a knob the mallard which is the stock from whence our tame breed has probably been produced the pintail with the two middle feathers of the tail three inches longer than the rest the pochard with the head and neck of a bright bay the widgeon with a leadcoloured bill and the plumage of the back marked with narrow black and white undulated lines but best known by its whistling sound lastly the teal which is the smallest of this kind with the bill black the head and upper part of the neck of a bright bay these are the most common birds of the duck kind among ourselves but who can describe the amazing variety of this tribe if he extends his view to the different quarters of the world the most noted of the foreign tribe are the muscovy duck or more properly speaking the musk duck so called from a supposed musky smell with naked skin round the eyes and which is a native of africa the brasilian duck that is of the size of a goose all over black except the tips of the wings the american wood duck with a variety of beautiful colors and a plume of feathers that falls from the back of the head like a friars cowl these and twenty others might be added were increasing the number of names the way to enlarge the sphere of our comprehension  all these live in the manner of our domestic ducks keeping together in flocks in the winter and flying in pairs in summer bringing up their young by the waterside and leading them to their food as soon as out of the shell their nests are usually built among heath or rushes not far from the water and they lay twelve fourteen or more eggs before they sit yet this is not always their method the dangers they continually encounter from their ground situation sometimes obliges them to change their manner of building and their awkward nests are often seen exalted on the tops of trees this must be a very great labor to perform as the ducks bill is but illformed for building a nest and giving the materials of which it is composed a sufficient stability to stand the weather the nest whether high or low is generally composed of singular materials the longest grass mixed with heath and lined within with the birds own feathers usually go to the composition however in proportion as the climate is colder the nest is more artificially made and more warmly lined in the artic regions nothing can exceed the great care all of this kind take to protect their eggs from the intenseness of the weather while the gull and the penguin kind seem to disregard the severest cold the duck in those regions forms itself a hole to lay in shelters the approach lines it with a layer of long grass and clay within that another of moss and lastly a warm coat of feathers or down the eider duck is particularly remarkable for the warmth of its nest this bird which as was said is above twice as large as the common duck and resides in the colder climates lays from six to eight eggs making her nest among the rocks or the plants along the seashore the external materials of the nest are such as are in common with the rest of the kind but the inside lining on which the eggs are immediately deposited is at once the softest warmest and the lightest substance with which we are acquainted this is no other than the inside down which covers the breast of the bird in the breedingseason this the female plucks off with her bill and furnishes the inside of her nest with a tapestry more valuable than the most skilful artists can produce the natives watch the place where she begins to build and suffering her to lay take away both the eggs and the nest the duck however not discouraged by the first disappointment builds and lays in the same place a second time and this they in the same manner take away the third time she builds but the drake must supply the down from his breast to line the nest with and if this be robbed they both forsake the place and breed there no more this down the natives take care to separate from the dirt and moss with which it is mixed and though no people stand in more need of a warm covering than themselves yet their necessities compel them to sell it to the more indolent and luxurious inhabitants of the south for brandy and tobacco  as they possess the faculties of flying and swimming so they are in general birds of passage and it is most probable perform their journies across the ocean as well on the water as in the air those that migrate to this country on the approach of winter are seldom found so well tasted or so fat as the fowls that continue with us the year round their flesh is often lean and still oftener fishy which flavor it has probably contracted in the journey as their food in the lakes of lapland from whence they descend is generally of the insect kind  as soon as they arrive among us they are generally seen flying in flocks to make a survey of those lakes where they intend to take up their residence for the winter in the choice of these they have two objects in view to be near their food and yet remote from interruption their chief aim is to choose some lake in the neighborhood of a marsh where there is at the same time a cover of woods and where insects are found in greatest abundance lakes therefore with a marsh on one side and a wood on the other are seldom without vast quantities of wild fowl and where a couple are seen at any time that is a sufficient inducement to bring hundreds of others the ducks flying in the air are often lured down from their heights by the loud voice of the mallard from below nature seems to have furnished this bird with very particular faculties for calling the wind pipe where it begins to enter the lungs opens into a kind of bony cavity where the sound is reflected as in a musical instrument and is heard a great way off to this call all the stragglers resort and in a week or a fortnights time a lake that before was quite naked is black with waterfowl that have left their lapland retreats to keep company with our ducks who never stirred from home  they generally choose that part of the lake where they are inaccessible to the approach of the fowler in which they all appear huddled together extremely busy and very loud what it is can employ them all the day is not easy to guess there is no food for them at the place where they sit and cabal thus as they choose the middle of the lake and as for courtship the season for that is not yet come so that it is wonderful what can so busily keep them occupied not one of them seems a moment at rest now pursuing one another now screaming then all up at once then down again the whole seems one strange scene of bustle with nothing to do  they frequently go off in a more private manner by night to feed in the adjacent meadows and ditches which they dare not venture to approach by day in these nocturnal adventures they are often taken for though a timorous bird yet they are easily deceived and every spring seems to succeed in taking them but the greatest quantities are taken in decoys which though well known near london are yet untried in the remoter parts of the country the manner of making and managing a decoy is as follows  a place is to be chosen for this purpose far remote from the common highway and all noise of people a decoy is best where there is a large pond surrounded by a wood and beyond that a marshy and uncultivated country when the place is chosen the pool if possible is to be planted round with willows unless a wood answers the purpose of shading it on every side on the south and north side of this pool are two three or four ditches or channels made broad toward the pool and growing narrower till they end in a point these channels are to be covered over with nets supported by hooped sticks bending from one side to the other so that they form a vault or arch growing narrower and narrower to the point where it is terminated by a tunnelnet like that in which fish are caught in weirs along the banks of these channels so netted over which are called pipes many hedges are made of reeds slanting to the edge of the channel the acute angles to the side next the pool the whole apparatus also is to be hidden from the pool by a hedge of reeds along the margin behind which the fowler manages his operations the place being fitted in this manner the fowler is to provide himself with a number of wild ducks made tame which are called decoys these are always to be fed at the mouth or entrance of the pipe and to be accustomed to come at a whistle  as soon as the evening is set in the decoy rises as they term it and the wild fowl feed during the night if the evening be still the noise of their wings during their flight is heard at a very great distance and produces no unpleasing sensation the fowler when he finds a fit opportunity and sees his decoy covered with fowl walks about the pool and observes into what pipe the birds gathered in the pool may be enticed or driven then casting hemp seed or some such seed as will float on the suface of the water at the entrance and up along the pipe he whistles to his decoyducks who instantly obey the summons and come to the entrance of the pipe in hopes of being fed as usual thither also they are followed by a whole flock of wild ones who little suspect the danger preparing against them their sense of smelling however is very exquisite and they would soon discover their enemy but that the fowler always keeps a piece of turf burning at his nose against which he breathes and this prevents the effluvia of his person from reaching their exquisite senses the wild ducks therefore pursuing the decoyducks are led into the broad mouth of the channel or pipe nor have the least suspicion of the man who keeps hidden behind one of the hedges when they have got up the pipe however finding it grow more and more narrow they begin to suspect danger and would return back but they are now prevented by the man who shows himself at the broad end below thither therefore they dare not return and rise they may not as they are kept by the net above from ascending the only way left them therefore is the narrow funnelled net at the bottom into this they fly and there they are taken  it often happens however that the wildfowl are in such a state of sleepiness or dozing that they will not follow the decoy ducks use is then generally made of a dog who is taught his lesson he passes backward and forward between the reedhedges in which there are little holes both for the decoyman to see and for the little dog to pass through this attracts the eye of the wild fowl who prompted by curiosity advance toward this little animal while he all the time keeps playing among the reeds nearer and nearer the funnel till they follow him too far to recede sometimes the dog will not attract their attention till a red handkerchief or something very singular be put about him the decoyducks never enter the funnelnet with the rest being taught to dive under water as soon as the rest are driven in  the general season for catching fowl in decoys is from the latter end of october till february the taking them earlier is prohibited by an act of george the second which imposes a penalty of five shillings for every bird destroyed at any other season  the lincolnshire decoys are commonly let at a certain annual rent from five pounds to twenty pounds a year and some even amount to thirty these principally contribute to supply the markets of london with wildfowl the number of ducks wigeon and teal that are sent thither is amazing above thirty thousand have been sent up in one season from ten decoys in the neighborhood of wainfleet this quantity makes them so cheap on the spot that it is asserted the several decoymen would be glad to contract for years to deliver their ducks at the next town for tenpence the couple  to this manner of taking wildfowl in england i will subjoin another still more extraordinary frequently practiced in china whenever the fowler sees a number of ducks settled in any particular plash of water he sends off two or three gourds to float among them these gourds resemble our pompions but being made hollow they swim on the surface of the water and on one pool there may sometimes be seen twenty or thirty of these gourds floating together the fowl at first are a little shy of coming near them but by degrees they come nearer and as all birds at last grow familiar with a scarecrow the ducks gather about these and amuse themselves by whetting their bills against them when the birds are as familiar with the gourds as the fowler could wish he then prepares to deceive them in good earnest he hollows out one of these gourds large enough to put his head in and making holes to breathe and see through he claps it on his head thus accoutred he wades slowly into the water keeping his body under and nothing but his head in the gourd above the surface and in that manner moves imperceptibly toward the fowls who suspect no danger at last however he fairly gets in among them while they having been long used to see gourds take not the least fright while the enemy is in the very midst of them and an insiduous enemy he is for ever as he approaches a fowl he seizes it by the legs and draws it in a jerk under water there he fastens it under his girdle and goes to the next till he has thus loaded himself with as many as he can carry away when he has got his quantity without ever attempting to disturb the rest of the fowls on the pool he slowly moves offagain and in this manner pays the flock three or four visits in a day of all the various artifices for catching fowl this seems likely to be attended with the greatest success as it is the most practiced in china  chap xiii of the kingfisher i will conclude this history of birds with one that seems to unite in itself somewhat of every class preceding it seems at once possessed of appetites for prey like the rapacious kinds with an attachment to water like the birds of that element it exhibits in its form the beautiful plumage of the peacock the shadings of the hummingbird the bill of the crane and the short legs of the swallow the bird i mean is the kingfisher of which many extraordinary falsehoods have been propagated and yet of which many extraordinary things remain to be said that are actually true  the kingfisher is not much larger than a swallow its shape is clumsy the legs disproportionably small and the bill disproportionably long it is two inches from the base to the tip the upper chap black and the lower yellow but the colors of this bird atone for its inelegant form the crown of the head and the coverts of the wings are of a deep blackish green spotted with bright azure the back and tail are of the most resplendent azure the whole underside of the body is orangecoloured a broad mark of the same passes from the bill beyond the eyes beyond that is a large white spot the tail is short and consists of twelve feathers of a rich deep blue the feet are of a reddish yellow and the three joints of the outmost toe adhere to the middle toe while the inner toe adheres only by one  from the diminutive size the slender short legs and the beautiful colors of this bird no person would be led to suppose it one of the most rapacious little animals that skims the deep yet it is for ever on the wing and feeds on fish which it takes in surprising quantities when we consider its size and figure it chiefly frequents the banks of rivers and takes its prey after the manner of the osprey balancing itself at a certain distance above the water for a considerable space then darting into the deep and seizing the fish with inevitable certainty while it remains suspended in the air in a bright day the plumage exhibits a beautiful variety of the most dazzling and brilliant colors it might have been this extraordinary beauty that has given rise to fable for wherever there is any thing uncommon fancy is always willing to increase the wonder  of this bird it has been said that she built her nest on the water and thus in a few days hatched and produced her young but to be uninterrupted in this task she was said to be possessed of a charm to allay the fury of the waves and during this period the mariner might sail with the greatest security the ancient poets are full of these fables their historians are not exempt from them cicero has written a long poem in praise of the halcyon of which there remains but two lines even the emperor gordian has written a poem on this subject of which we have nothing remaining these fables have been adopted each by one of the earliest fathers of the church behold says st ambrose the little bird which in the midst of the winter lays her eggs on the sand by the shore from that moment the winds are hushed the sea becomes smooth and the calm continues for fourteen days this is the time she requires seven days to hatch and seven days to foster her young their creator has taught these little animals to make their nest in the midst of the most stormy season only to manifest his kindness by granting them a lasting calm the seamen are not ignorant of this blessing they call this interval of fair weather their halcyon days and they are particularly careful to seize the opportunity as then they need fear no interruption this and an hundred other instances might be given of the credulity of mankind with respect to this bird they entered into speculations concerning the manner of her calming the deep the formation of her nest and her peculiar sagacity at present we do not speculate because we know with respect to our kingfisher that most of the facts are false it may be alleged indeed with some show of reason that the halcyon of the ancients was a different bird from our kingfisher it may be urged that many birds especially on the indian ocean build a floating nest upon the sea but still the history of the ancient halcyon is clogged with endless fable and it is but an indifferent method to vindicate falsehood by showing that a part of the story is true  the kingfisher with which we are acquainted at present has none of those powers of allaying the storm or building upon the waves it is contented to make its nest on the banks of rivers in such situations as not to be affected by the rising of the stream when it has found a place for its purpose it hollows out with its bill a hole about a yard deep or if it finds the deserted hole of a rat or one caused by the root of a tree decaying it takes quiet possession this hole it enlarges at the bottom to a good size and lining it with the down of the willow lays its eggs there without any farther preparation  its nest or rather hole is very different from that described by the ancients by whom it is said to be made in the shape of a long necked gourd of the bones of the seaneedle the bones indeed are found there in great quantities as well as the scales of fishes but these are the remains of the birds food and by no means brought there for the purposes of warmth or convenience the kingfisher as bellonius says feeds upon fish but is incapable of digesting the bones and scales which he throws up again as eagles and owls are seen to do a part of their prey these fill the birds nest of course and although they seem as if designedly placed there are only a kind of nuisance  in these holes which from the remains of fish brought there are very foetid the kingfisher is often found with from five eggs to nine there the female continues to hatch even though disturbed and though the nest be robbed she will again return and lay there i have had one of those females brought me says reaumur which was taken from her nest about three leagues from my house after admiring the beauty of her colors i let her fly again when the fond creature was instantly seen to return back to the nest where she had just before been made a captive there joining the male she again began to lay though it was for the third time and though the season was very far advanced at each time she had seven eggs the older the nest is the greater quantity of fishbones and scales does it contain these are disposed without any order and sometimes take up a good deal of room  the female begins to lay early in the season and excludes her first brood about the beginning of april the male whose fidelity exceeds even that of the turtle brings her large provisions of fish while she is thus employed and she contrary to most other birds is found plump and fat at that season the male that used to twitter before this now enters the nest as quietly and as privately as possible the young ones are hatched at the expiration of twenty days but are seen to differ as well in their size as in their beauty  as the ancients have had their fables concerning this bird so have the modern vulgar it is an opinion generally received among them that the flesh of the kingfisher will not corrupt and that it will even banish all vermin this has no better foundation than that which is said of its always pointing when hung up dead with its breast to the north the only truth which can be affirmed of this bird when killed is that its flesh is utterly unfit to be eaten while its beautiful plumage preserves its luster longer than that of any other bird we know  having thus given a short history of birds i own i cannot take leave of this most beautiful part of the creation without reluctance these splendid inhabitants of air possess all those qualities that can sooth the heart and cheer the fancy the brightest colors the roundest forms the most active manners and the sweetest music in sending the imagination in pursuit of these in following them to the chirruping grove the screaming precipice or the glassy deep the mind naturally lost the sense of its own situation and attentive to their little sports almost forgot the task of describing them innocently to amuse the imagination in this dream of life is wisdom and nothing is useless that by furnishing mental employment keeps us for a while in oblivion of those stronger appetites that lead to evil but every rank and state of mankind may find something to imitate in those delightful songsters and we may not only employ the time but mend our lives by the contemplation from their courage in defense of their young and their assiduity in incubation the coward may learn to be brave and the rash to be patient the inviolable attachment of some to their companions may give lessons of fidelity and the connubial tenderness of others be a monitor to the incontinent even those that are tyrants by nature never spread capricious destruction and unlike man never inflict a pain but when urged by necessity  the natural history of fishes part i the cetaceous kind an history of fishes chap i of fishes in general the ocean is the great receptacle of fishes it has been thought by some that all fish are naturally of that salt element and that they have mounted up into fresh water by some accidental migration a few still swim up rivers to deposit their spawn but of the great body of fishes of which the size is enormous and the shoals are endless those all keep to the sea and would quickly expire in fresh water in that extensive and undiscovered abode millions reside whose manners are a secret to us and whose very form is unknown the curiosity of mankind indeed has drawn some from their depths and his wants many more with the figure of these at least he is acquainted but for their pursuits migrations societies antipathies pleasures times of gestation and manner of bringing forth these all are hidden in the turbulent element that protects them  the number of fish to which we have given names and of the figure at least of which we know something according to linnaeus are above four hundred thus to appearance indeed the history of fish is tolerably copious but when we come to examine it will be found that of the greatest part of these we know very little those qualities singularities or advantages that render animals worth naming still remain to be discovered the history of fishes therefore has little in it entertaining for our philosophers hitherto instead of studying their nature have been employed in increasing their catalogues and the reader instead of observations or facts is presented with a long list of names that disgust him with their barren superfluity it must displease him to see the language of a science increasing while the science itself has nothing to repay the increasing tax laid upon his memory  most fish offer us the same external form sharp at either end and swelling in the middle by which they are enabled to traverse the fluid which they inhabit with greater celerity and ease that peculiar shape which nature has granted to most fishes we endeavor to imitate in such vessels as are designed to sail with the greatest swiftness however the progress of a machine moved forward in the water by human contrivance is nothing to the rapidity of an animal destined by nature to reside there any of the large fish overtake a ship in full sail with great ease play round it without effort and outstrip it at pleasure every part of the body seems exerted in this dispatch the fins the tail and the motion of the whole backbone assist progression and it is to that flexibility of body at which art cannot arrive that fishes owe their great velocity  the chief instruments in a fishs motion are the fins which in some fish are much more numerous than in others a fish completely fitted for sailing is furnished with not less than two pair also three single fins two above and one below thus equipped it migrates with the utmost rapidity and takes voyages of a thousand leagues in a season but it does not always happen that such fish as have the greatest number of fins have the swiftest motion the shark is thought to be one of the swiftest swimmers yet it wants the ventral or belly fins the haddock does not move so swift yet it is completely fitted for motion  but the fins serve not only to assist the animal in progression but in rising or sinking in turning or even leaping out of the water to answer these purposes the pectoral fins serve like oars to push the animal forward they are placed at some little distance behind the opening of the gills they are generally large and strong and answer the same purposes to the fish in the water as wings do to a bird in the air with the help of these and by their continued motion the flyingfish is sometimes seen to rise out of the water and to fly above an hundred yards till fatigued with its exertions it is obliged to sink down again these also serve to balance the fishs head when it is too large for the body and keep it from tumbling prone to the bottom as is seen in large headed fishes when the pectoral fins are cut off next these are seen the ventral fins placed toward the lower part of the body under the belly these are always seen to lie flat on the water in whatever situation the fish may be and they serve rather to raise or depress the fish in its element than to assist progressive motion the dorsal fin is situated along the ridge of the back and serves to keep it in equilibrio as also to assist its progressive motion in many fishes this is wanting but in all flat fishes it is very large as the pectoral fins are proportionably small the anal fin occupies that part of the fish which lies between the anus and the tail and this serves to keep the fish in its upright or vertical situation lastly the tail which in some fishes is flat and upright in others seems the grand instrument of motion the fins are but all subservient to it and give direction to its great impetus by which the fish seems to dart forward with so much velocity to explain all this by experiment a carp is taken and put into a large vessel the fish in a state of repose spreads all its fins and seems to rest upon its pectoral and ventral fins near the bottom if the fish folds up for it has the power of folding either of its pectoral fins it inclines to the same side folding the right pectoral fin the fish inclines to the right side folding the left fin it inclines to that side in turn when the fish desires to have a retrogade motion striking with the pectoral fins in a contrary direction effectually produces it if the fish desires to turn a blow from the tail sends it about but if the tail strikes both ways then the motion is progressive in pursuance of these observations if the dorsal and ventral fins be cut off the fish reels to the right and left and endeavors to supply its loss by keeping the rest of its fins in constant employment if the right pectoral fin be cut off the fish leans to that side if the ventral fin on the same side be cut away then it loses its equilibrium entirely when the tail is cut off the fish loses all motion and gives itself up to where the water impels it  from hence it appears that each of these instruments has a peculiar use assigned it but at the same time that they all conspire to assist each others motions some fish are possessed of all whose motions are yet not the swiftest others have but a part and yet dart in the water with great rapidity the number the size and the situation of the fins therefore seem rather calculated to correspond with the animals figure than solely to answer the purposes of promoting its speed where the head is large and heavy there the pectoral fins are large and placed forward to keep it from oversetting where the head is small or produced out into a long beak and therefore not too heavy for the tail the pectoral fins are small and the ventral fins totally wanting  as most animals that live upon land are furnished with a covering to keep off the injuries of the weather so all that live in the water are covered with a slimy glutinous matter that like a sheath defends their bodies from the immediate contact of the surrounding fluid this substance may be considered as a secretion from the pores of the animals body and serving not only to defend but to assist the fishs easy progress through the water beneath this in many kinds is found a strong covering of scales that like a coat of mail defend it still more powerfully and under that before we come to the muscular parts of the body an oily substance which supplies the requisite warmth and vigor  the fish thus protected and fitted for motion in its natural element seems as well furnished with the means of happiness as quadrupedes or birds but if we come to examine its faculties more nearly we shall find it very much their inferior the sense of touching which beasts and birds have in a small degree the fish covered up in its own coat of mail can have but little acquaintance with  the sense of smelling which in beasts is so exquisite and among birds is not wholly unknown seems given to fishes in a very moderate proportion it is true that all fishes have one or more nostrils and even those that have not the holes perceptible without yet have the proper formation of the bones for smelling within but as air is the only medium we know for the distribution of odours it cannot be supposed that these animals residing in water can be possessed of any power of being affected by them if they have any perception of smells it must be in the same manner as we distinguish by our taste and it is probable the olfactory membrane in fish serves them instead of a distinguishing palate by this they judge of substances that first tincturing the water with their vapors are thus sent to the nostrils of the fish and no doubt produce some kind of sensation this most probably must be the use of that organ in those animals as otherwise there would be the instruments of a sense provided for them without any power in them of enjoyment  as to tasting they seem to make very little distinction the palate of most fish is hard and bony and consequently incapable of the powers of relishing different substances this sense among quadrupedes who possess it in some degree arises from the soft pliancy of the organ and the delicacy of the skin which covers the instruments of tasting it may be considered in them as a more perfect and delicate kind of feeling in the bony palate of fish therefore all powers of distinguishing are utterly taken away and we have accordingly often seen these voracious animals swallow the fishermans plummet instead of the bait  hearing in fishes is found still more imperfect if it be found at all certain it is that anatomists have not been able to discover except in the whale kind the smallest traces of an organ either within or without the head of fishes it is true that in the center of the brain of some fishes are found now and then some little bones the number and situation of which are entirely accidental these bones mr klein has supposed to constitute the organ of hearing but if we consider their entire dissimilitude to the bones that serve for hearing in other animals we shall be of another opinion the greatest number of fishes are deprived of these bones entirely some fish have them in small numbers and others in abundance yet neither testify any excellence or defect in hearing indeed of what advantage would this sense be to animals that are incapable of making themselves heard they have no voice to communicate with each other and consequently have no need of an organ for hearing mr gouan who kept some gold fishes in a vase informs us that whatever noise he made he could neither disturb nor terrify them he hallowed as loud as he could putting a piece of paper between his mouth and the water to prevent the vibrations from affecting the surface and the fishes still seemed insensible but when the paper was removed and the sound had its full play upon the water the fishes seemed instantly to feel the change and shrunk to the bottom from this we may learn that fishes are as deaf as they are mute and that when they seem to hear the call of a whistle or a bell at the edge of a pond it is rather the vibrations of the sound that affect the water by which they are excited than any sounds that they hear  seeing seems to be the sense fishes are possessed of in the greatest degree and yet even this seems obscure if we compare it to that of other animals the eye in almost all fish is covered with the same transparent skin that covers the rest of the head and which probably serves to defend it in the water as they are without eyelids the globe is more depressed anteriorly and is furnished behind with a muscle which serves to lengthen or flatten it according to the necessities of the animal the chrystaline humor which in quadrupedes is flat and of the shape of a button mould in fishes is as round as a pea or sometimes oblong like an egg from all this it appears that fish are extremely nearsighted and that even in the water they can see objects at a very small distance this distance might very easily be ascertained by comparing the refraction of bodies in the water with that formed by a lens that is spherical those unskilled in mathematical calculations will have a general idea of this from the glasses used by nearsighted people those whose chrystaline humor is too unequal or in other words too round are always very nearsighted and obliged to use concave glasses to correct the imperfections of nature the chrystaline humor of fish is so round that it is not in the power of any glasses much less of water to correct their vision this chrystaline humor in fishes all must have seen being that little hard pealike substance which is found in their eyes after boiling in the natural state it is transparent and not much harder than a jelly  from all this it appears how far fish fall behind terrestrial animals in their sensations and consequently in their enjoyments even their brain which is by some supposed to be of a size with every animals understanding shows that fish are inferior even to birds in this particular it is divided into three parts surrounded with a whitish froth and gives off nerves as well to the sense of sight as of smelling in some fish it is gray in others white in some it is flatted in others round but in all extremely small compared to the bulk of the animal  thus nature seems to have fitted these animals with appetites and powers of an inferior kind and formed them for a sort of passive existence in the obscure and heavy element to which they are consigned to preserve their own existence and to continue it to their posterity fill up the whole circle of their pursuits and enjoyments to these they are impelled rather by necessity than choice and seem mechanically excited to every fruition their senses are incapable of making any distinctions but they drive forward in pursuit of whatever they can swallow conquer or enjoy  a ceaseless desire of food seems to give the ruling impulse to all their motions this appetite impels them to encounter every danger and indeed their rapacity seems insatiable even when taken out of the water and almost expireing they greedily swallow the very bait by which they were allured to destruction  the maw is in general placed next the mouth and though possessed of no sensible heat is however endued with a surprising faculty of digestion its digestive power seems in some measure to increase with the quantity of food it is supplied with a single pike having been known to devour an hundred roaches in three days its faculties also are as extraordinary for it digests not only fish but much harder substances prawns crabs and lobsters shells and all these the cod or the sturgeon will not only devour but dissolve down though their shells are so much harder than the sides of the stomach which contains them this amazing faculty in the cold maw of fishes has justly excited the curiosity of philosophers and has effectually overturned the system of those who supposed that the heat of the stomach was alone a sufficient instrument for digestion the truth seems to be and some experiments of the skilful dr hunter seem to evince that there is a power of animal assimilation lodged in the stomach of all creatures which we can neither describe nor define converting the substances they swallow into a fluid fitted for their own peculiar support this is done neither by trituration nor by warmth nor by motion nor by a dissolving fluid nor by their united efforts but by some principle in the stomach yet unknown which acts in a different manner from all kinds of artificial maceration the meat taken into the stomach or maw is often seen though very near being digested still to retain its original form and ready for a total dissolution while it appears to the eye as yet untouched by the force of the stomach this animal power is lodged in the maw of fishes in a greater degree than in any other creatures their digestive powers are quick and their appetites ever are craving  yet though fish are thus hungry and forever prowling no animals can suffer the want of food for so long a time the gold and silver fish we keep in vases seem never to want any nourishment at all whether it be that they feed on the waterinsects too minute for our observation or that water alone is a sufficient supply is not evident but they are often seen for months without apparent sustenance even the pike the most voracious of fishes will live in a pond where there is none but himself and what is more extraordinary will be often found to thrive there  still however fish are of all other animals the most voracious and insatiable whatever any of them is able to swallow possessed of life seems to be considered as the most desirable food some that have very small mouths feed upon worms and the spawn of other fish others whose mouths are larger seek larger prey it matters not of what kind whether of another or their own those with the largest mouths pursue almost every thing that has life and often meet each other in fierce opposition when the fish with the largest swallow comes off with the victory and devours its antagonist  thus are they irritated by the continual desire of satisfying their hunger and the life of a fish from the smallest to the greatest is but one scene of hostility violence and evasion but the smaller fry stand no chance in the unequal combat and their usual way of escaping is by swimming into those shallows where the greater are unable or too heavy to pursue there they become invaders in turn and live upon the spawn of larger fish which they find floating upon the surface of the water yet there are dangers attending them in every place even in the shallows the muscle the oyster and the scallop lie in ambush at the bottom with their shells open and whatever little fish inadvertently approaches into contact they at once close their shells upon him and devour the imprisoned prey at their leisure  nor is the pursuit of fishes like that of terrestrial animals confined to a single region or to one effort shoals of one species follow those of another through vasts tracts of ocean from the vicinity of the pole even down to the equator thus the cod from the banks of newfoundland pursues the whiting which flies before it even to the southern shores of spain the cachalot is said in the same manner to pursue a shoal of herrings and to swallow thousands at a gulp  this may be one cause of the annual migration of fishes from one part of the ocean to the other but there are other motives which come in aid of this also fishes may be induced to change the place of their residence for one more suited to their constitutions or more adapted to depositing their spawn it is remarkable that no fish are fond of very cold waters and generally frequent those places where it is warmest thus in summer they are seen in great numbers in the shallows near the shore where the sun has power to warm the water to the bottom on the contrary in winter they are found toward the bottom in the deep sea for the cold of the atmosphere is not sufficiently penetrating to reach them at those great depths cold produces the same effect upon fresh water fishes and when they are often seen dead after severe frosts it is most probable that they have been killed by the severity of the cold as well as by their being excluded by the ice from air  all fish live in the water yet they all stand in need of air for their support those of the whale kind indeed breathe the air in the same manner as we do and come to the surface every two or three minutes to take a fresh inspiration but those which continue entirely under water are yet under a necessity of being supplied with air or they will expire in a very few minutes we sometimes see all the fish of a pond killed when the ice every where covers the surface of the water and thus keeps off the air from the subjacent fluid if a hole be made in the ice the fish will be seen to come all to that part in order to take the benefit of a fresh supply should a carp in a large vase of water be placed under an airpump and then be deprived of its air during the operation a number of bubbles will be seen standing upon the surface of the fishs body soon after the animal will appear to breathe swifter and with greater difficulty it will then be seen to rise toward the surface to get more air the bubbles on its surface begin to disappear the belly that was before swolen will then fall of a sudden and the animal sinks expiring and convulsed at the bottom  so very necessary is air to all animals but particularly to fish that as was said they can live but a few minutes without it yet nothing is more difficult to be accounted for than the manner in which they obtain this necessary supply those who have seen a fish in the water must remember the motion of its lips and its gills or at least of the bones on each side that cover them this motion in the animal is without doubt analogous to our breathing but it is not air but water that the fish actually sucks in and spouts out through the gills at every motion the manner of its breathing is thus the fish first takes a quantity of water by the mouth which is driven to the gills these close and keep the water so swallowed from returning by the mouth while the bony covering of the gills prevents it from going through them until the animal has drawn the proper quantity of air from the body of water thus imprisoned then the bony covers open and give it a free passage by which means also the gills again are opened and admit a fresh quantity of water should the fish be prevented from the free play of its gills or should the bony covers be kept from moving by a string tied round them the animal would soon fall into convulsions and die in a few minutes  but though this be the general method of explaining respiration in fishes the difficulty remains to know what is done with this air which the fish in this manner separates from the water there seems no receptacle for containing it the stomach being the chief cavity within the body is too much filled with aliment for that purpose there is indeed a cavity and that a pretty large one i mean the airbladder or swim which may serve to contain it for vital purposes but that our philosophers have long destined to a very different use the use universally assigned to the airbladder is the enabling the fish to rise or sink in the water at pleasure as that is dilated or compressed the use assigned by the ancients for it was to come in aid of the lungs and to remain as a kind of storehouse of air to supply the animal in its necessities i own my attachment to this last opinion but let us exhibit both with their proper share of evidence and the reader must be left to determine  the airbladder is described as a bag filled with air sometimes composed of one sometimes of two and sometimes of three divisions situated toward the back of the fish and opening into the maw or the gullet those who contend that this bag is designed for raising or depressing the fish in the water build upon the following experiment a carp being put into the airpump and the air exhausted the bladder is said to expand itself to such a degree that the fish swells in an extraordinary manner till the bladder bursts and then the fish sinks and ever after continues to crawl at the bottom on another occasion the airbladder was pricked and wounded which let out its air upon which the fish funk to the bottom and was not seen to rise after from thence it is inferred that the use of the airbladder must be by swelling at the will of the animal thus to increase the surface of the fishs body and thence diminishing its specific gravity to enable it to rise to the top of the water and keep there at pleasure on the contrary when the fish wants to descend it is say they but to exhaust this bladder of its air and the fish being thus rendered slimmer and heavier consequently sinks to the bottom  such is the account given of the use of the airbladder no part of which seems to me well supported in the first place though nothing is more certain than that a carp put into the airpump will swell yet so will a mouse or a frog and these we know to have no airbladders a carp will rise to the surface but so will all fish that want air whether they have an airbladder or not the airbladder is said to burst in the experiment but that i deny the airbladder is indeed found empty but it has suffered no laceration and may be distended by being blown into like any other bladder that is sound the fish after the experiment i grant continues to creep at the bottom and so will all fish that are sick and wounded which must be the case with this after such an operation thus these facts prove nothing but that when the fish is killed in an airpump the airbladder is found exhausted and that it will naturally and necessarily be for the drain of air by which the fish is supplied in the natural way will necessarily oblige it to make use of all its hidden stores and as there is a communication between the gullet and the airbladder the air which the latter contains will thus be obviously drawn away but still farther how comes the airbladder according to their hypothesis to swell under the experiment of the airpump what is it that closes the aperture of that organ in such a manner as at last to burst it or what necessity has the fish for dilating it to that violent degree at most it only wants to rise to the surface and that the fish can easily do without so great a distention of the airbladder indeed it should rather seem that the more the air was wanted without the less necessity there was for its being uselessly accumulated within and to make the modern system consistent the fish under the airpump instead of permitting its bladder to be burst would readily give up its contents which upon their supposition all can do at pleasure  but the truth is the fish can neither increase nor diminish the quantity of air in its airbladder at will no more than we can that which is contained in our stomachs the animal has no one muscle much less pair of muscles for contracting or dilating this organ its aperture is from the gullet and what air is put into it must remain there till the necessities and not the will of the animal call it forth as a supply  but to put the matter past a doubt many fish are furnished with an airbladder that continually crawl at the bottom such as the eel and the flounder and many more are entirely without any bladder that swim at ease in every depth such as the anchovy and fresh water gudgeon redi  indeed the number of fish that want this organ is alone a sufficient proof that it is not so necessary for the purposes of swimming and as the ventral fins which in all fish lie flat upon the water seem fully sufficient to keep them at all depths i see no great occasion for this internal philosophical apparatus for raising and depressing them upon the whole the airbladder seems adapted for different purposes than that of keeping the fish at different depths in the water but whether it be to supply them with air when it is wanted from without or for what other purpose i will not take upon me to determine  hitherto we have seen fish in every respect inferior to land animals in the simplicity of their conformation in their senses and their enjoyments but of that humble existence which they have been granted by nature they have a longer term than any other class of animated nature most of the disorders incident to mankind says bacon arise from the changes and alterations of the atmosphere but fishes reside in an element little subject to change theirs is an uniform existence their movements are without effort and their life without labor their bones also which are united by cartilages admit of indefinite extension and the different sizes of animals of the same kind among fishes is very various they still keep growing their bodies instead of suffering the rigidity of age which is the cause of natural decay in land animals still continue increasing with fresh supplies and as the body grows the conduits of life furnish their stores in greater abundance how long a fish that seems to have scarce any bounds put to its growth continues to live is not ascertained perhaps the life of a man would not be long enough to measure that of the smallest  there have been two methods devised for determining the age of fishes which are more ingenious than certain the one is by the circles of the scales the other by the transverse section of the backbone the first method is this when a fishs scale is examined through a microscope it will be found to consist of a number of circles one circle within another in some measure resembling those which appear upon the transverse section of a tree and supposed to offer the same information for as in trees we can tell their age by the number of their circles so in fishes we can tell theirs by the number of circles in every scale reckoning one ring for every year of the animals existence by this method mr buffon found a carp whose scales he examined to be not less than a hundred years old a thing almost incredible had we not several accounts in other authors which tend to confirm the discovery gesner brings us an instance of one of the same age and albertus of one more than double that period  the age of the skate and the ray that want scales may be known by the other method which is by separating the joints of the backbone and then minutely observing the number of rings which the surface where it was joined exhibits by this the fishs age is said to be known and perhaps with as much certainty as in the former instance  but how unsatisfactory soever these marks may be we have no reason to doubt the great age of some fishes those that have ponds often know the oldest by their superior size but the longevity of these animals is nothing when compared to their fecundity all sorts a few of the larger ones excepted multiply their kind some by hundreds and some by millions there are some that bring forth their young alive and some that only produce eggs the former are rather the least fruitful yet even these are seen to produce in great abundance the viviparous blenny for instance brings forth two or three hundred at a time all alive and playing round the parent together those who exclude their progeny in a more imperfect state and produce eggs which they are obliged to leave to chance either on the bottom at the edge of the water or floating on the surface where it is deeper are all much more prolific and seem to proportion their stock to the danger there is of its consumption of these eggs thus deposited scarce one in an hundred brings forth an animal they are devoured by all the lesser fry that frequent the shores by aquatic birds near the margin and by the larger fish in deep water still however there are enough for supplying the deep with inhabitants and notwithstanding their own rapacity and that of the fowls of various tribes the numbers that escape are sufficient to relieve the wants of a very considerable part of mankind indeed when we consider the numbers that a single fish is capable of producing the amount will seem astonishing if for instance we should be told of a being so very prolific that in a single season it could bring forth as many of its kind as there are inhabitants in england it would strike us with surprise yet a single cod produces full that number the cod spawns in one season as lewenhoeck assures us above nine million of eggs or peace contained in one single roe the flounder is commonly known to produce above one million and the mackarel above five hundred thousand such an amazing increase if permitted to come to maturity would overstock nature and even the ocean itself would not be able to contain much less to provide for the half of its inhabitants but two wise purposes are answered by this amazing increase it preserves the species in the midst of numberless enemies and serves to furnish the rest with a sustenance adapted to their nature  fishes seem all except the whalekind entirely divested of those parental solicitudes which so strongly mark the manners of the more perfect terrestrial animals how far they copulate remains as yet a doubt for though they seem to join yet the male is not furnished with any external instrument of generation it is said by some that his only end in that action is to emit his impregnating milt upon the eggs that at that time fall from the female he is said to be seen pursuing them as they float down the stream and carefully impregnating them one after another on some occasions also the females dig holes in the bottom of rivers and ponds and there deposit their spawn which is impregnated by the male in the same manner all this however is very doubtful what we know with certainty of the matter and that not discovered till very lately is that the male has two organs of generation that open into the bladder of urine and that these organs do not open into the rectum as in birds but have a particular aperture of their own vide gaman de generatione piscium  these organs of generation in the male are empty at some seasons of the year but before the time of spawing they are turgid with what is called the milt and emit the fluid proper for impregnation  fish have different seasons for depositing their spawn some that live in the depths of the ocean are said to choose the winter months but in general those with which we are acquainted choose the hottest months in summer and prefer such water as is somewhat tepefied by the beams of the sun they then leave the deepest parts of the ocean which are the coldest and shoal round the coasts or swim up the fresh water rivers which are warm as they are comparatively shallow when they have deposited their burdens they then return to their old stations and leave their nascent progeny to shift for themselves  the spawn continues in its eggstate in some fish longer than in others and this in proportion to the animals size in the salmon for instance the young animal continues in the egg from the beginning of december till the beginning of april the carp continues in the egg not above three weeks the little gold fish from china is produced still quicker these all when excluded at first escape by their minuteness and agility they rise sink and turn much readier than grown fish and they can escape into very shallow waters when pursued but with all their advantages scarce one in a thousand survives the numerous perils of its youth the very male and female that have given them birth are equally dangerous and formidable with the rest forgetting all relation at their departure  such is the general picture of these heedless and hungry creatures but there are some in this class living in the waters that are possessed of finer organs and higher sensations that have all the tenderness of birds or quadrupedes for their young that nurse them with constant care and protect them from every injury of this class are the cetaceous tribe or the fishes of the whalekind there are others though not capable of nursing their young yet that bring them alive into the world and defend them with courage and activity these are the cartilaginous kinds or those who have gristles instead of bones but the fierce unmindful tribe we have been describing that leave their spawn without any protection are called the spinous or bony kinds from their bones resembling the sharpness of thorns  thus there are three grand divisions in the fishkind the cetaceous the cartilaginous and the spinous all differing from each other in their conformation their appetites in their bringing forth and in the education of their young these three great distinctions are not the capricious differences formed by a maker of systems but are strongly and firmly marked in nature these are the distinctions of aristotle and they have been adopted by mankind ever since his time it will be necessary therefore to give the history of each of these in particular and then to range under each head those fishes whose history is the most remarkable or more properly speaking those of which we have any history for we shall find when we come to any of the species in particular how little can be said of their habits their stations or method of propagation  much indeed can be said of them if considered relatively to man and large books have been written of the manner of taking fish or of dressing them apicius is noted for having first taught mankind to suffocate fish in carthaginian pickle and quin for giving a sauce to the johndory mrs glass is famous for her eel pie and mr tull for his invention of spaying carp to give it a finer flavor in this manner our cooks handle the subject on the other hand our physicians assure us that the flesh of fishes yields little nourishment and soon corrupts that it abounds in a gross sort of oil and water and has but few volatile particles which renders it less fit to be converted into the substance of our bodies they are cold and moist and must needs say they produce juices of the same kind and consequently are improper to strengthen the body in this diversity of opinion it is the wisest way to eat our fish in the ordinary manner and pay no great attention to cooks or doctors  i cannot conclude this chapter without putting a question to the learned which i confess i am not able to resolve how comes it that fish which are bred in a salt element have yet no salt to the taste or that is capable of being extracted from it  chap ii of cetaceous fishes in general as on land there are some orders of animals that seem formed to command the rest with greater powers and more various instincts so in the ocean there are fishes which seem formed upon a nobler plan than others and that to their fishy form join the appetites and the conformation of quadrupedes these all are of the cetaceous kind and so much raised above their fellows of the deep in their appetites and instincts that almost all our modern naturalists have fairly excluded them from the finny tribes and will have them called not fishes but great beasts of the ocean with them it would be as improper to say men go to greenland fishing for whale as it would be to say that a sportsman goes to blackwall a fowling for mackarel  yet notwithstanding philosophers mankind will always have their own way of talking and for my own part i think them here in the right a different formation of the lungs stomach and intestines a different manner of breathing or propagating are not sufficient to counterbalance the great obvious analogy which these animals bear to the whole finny tribe they are shaped as other fishes they swim with fins they are entirely naked without hair they live in the water though they come up to breathe they are only seen in the depths of the ocean and never come upon shore but when forced thither these sure are sufficient to plead in favor of the general denomination and acquit mankind of error in ranking them with their lower companions of the deep  but still they are as many degrees raised above other fishes in their nature as they are in general in their size this tribe is composed of the whale and its varieties of the cachalot the dolphin the grampus and the porpess all these resemble quadrupedes in their internal structure and in some of their appetites and affections like quadrupedes they have lungs a midriff a stomach intestines liver spleen bladder and parts of generation their heart also resembles that of quadrupedes with its partitions closed up as in them and driving red and warm blood in circulation through the body in short every internal part bears a most striking similitude and to keep these parts warm the whole kind are also covered between the skin and the muscles with a thick coat of fat or blubber which like the baconfat of an hog keeps out the cold renders their muscles glib and pliant and probably makes them lighter in swimming  as these animals breathe the air it is obvious that they cannot bear to be any long time under water they are constrained therefore every two or three minutes to come up to the surface to take breath as well as to spout out through their nostril for they have but one that water which they sucked in while gaping for their prey this conduit by which they breathe and also throw out the water is placed in the head a little before the brain though externally the hole is but single it is internally divided by a bony partition which is closed by a sphincter muscle on the inside that like the mouth of a purse shuts it up at the pleasure of the animal there is also another muscle or valve which prevents the water from going down the gullet when therefore the animal takes in a certain quantity of water which is necessary to be discharged and separated from its food it shuts the mouth closes the valve of the stomach opens the sphincter that kept the nostril closed and then breathing strongly from the lungs pushes the water out by the effort as we see it rise by the pressure of air in a fireengine  the senses of these animals seem also superior to those of other fishes the eyes of other fishes we have observed are covered only with that transparent skin that covers the rest of the head but in all the cetaceous kinds it is covered by eyelids as in man this no doubt keeps that organ in a more perfect state by giving it intervals of relaxation in which all vision is suspended the other fishes that are for ever staring must see if for no other reason more feebly as their organs of sight are always exerted  as for hearing these also are furnished with the internal instruments of the ear although the external orifice no where appears it is most probable that this orifice may open by some canal resembling the eustachian tube into the mouth but this has not as yet been discovered  yet nature sure has not thus formed a complete apparatus for hearing and denied the animal the use of it when formed it is most likely that all animals of the cetaceous kind can hear as they certainly utter sounds and bellow to each other this vocal power would be as needless to animals naturally deaf as glasses to a man that was blind  but it is in the circumstances in which they continue their kind that these animals show an eminent superiority other fish deposit their spawn and leave the success to accident these never produce above one young or two at the most and this the female suckles entirely in the manner of quadrupedes her breasts being placed as in the human kind above the navel we have read many fabulous accounts of the nursing of the demigods of antiquity of their feeding on the marrow of lions and their being suckled by wolves one might imagine a still more heroic system of nutrition if we supposed that the young hero was suckled and grew strong upon the breastmilk of a shewhale  the whale or the grampus are terrible at any time but are fierce and desperate in the defense of their young in wallers beautiful poem of the summer islands we have a story founded upon fact which shows the maternal tenderness of these animals for their offspring a whale and her cub had got into an arm of the sea where by the desertion of the tide they were enclosed on every side the people from shore soon saw their situation and drove down upon them in boats with such weapons as the urgent occasion offered the two animals were soon wounded in several places and the whole sea round was tinctured with their blood the whales made several attempts to escape and at last the old one by its superior strength forced over the shallow into the depths of the ocean but though in safety herself she could not bear the danger that awaited her young one she therefore rushed in once more where the smaller animal was imprisoned and resolved when she could not protect at least to share his danger  the story ends with poetical justice for the tide coming in brought off both in safety from their enemies though not without sustaining an infinite number of wounds in every part  as to the rest the distinctive marks of this tribe are that the number of their fins never exceeds three namely two pectoral fins and one back fin but in some sorts the last is wanting these fins differ very much from those of other fishes which are formed of straight spines the fins of the cetaceous tribe are made up of bones and muscles and the skeleton of one of their fins very much resembles the skeleton of a mans hand their tails also are different from those of all other fish they are placed so as to lie flat on the surface of the water while the other kinds have them as we every day see upright or edgeways this flat position of the tail in cetaceous animals enables them to force themselves suddenly to the surface of the water to breathe which they are continually constrained to do  of these enormous animals some are without teeth and properly called whales others have the teeth only in the lower jaw and are called by the french cachalots the narwhal has teeth only in the upper jaw the dolphins teeth as well as those of the porpess and grampus are both above and below these are the marks that serve to distinguish the kinds of this enormous tribe from each other and these shall serve to guide us in giving their history  chap iii of the whale properly so called and its varieties if we compare land animals in respect to magnitude with those of the deep they will appear contemptible in the competition it is probable indeed that quadrupedes once existed much larger than we find them at present from the skeletons of some that have been dug up at different times it is evident that there must have been terrestrial animals twice as large as the elephant but creatures of such an immense bulk required a proportionable extent of ground for subsistence and by being rivals with men for large territory they must have been destroyed in the contest  but it is not only upon land that man has exerted his power of destroying the larger tribes of animated nature he has extended his efforts even into the midst of the ocean and has cut off numbers of those enormous animals that had perhaps existed for ages we now no longer hear of whales two hundred and two hundred and fifty feet long which we are certain were often seen about two centuries ago they have all been destroyed by the skill of mankind and the species is now dwindled into a race of diminutive animals from thirty to about eighty feet long  the northern seas were once the region to which the greatest of these animals resorted but so great has been the slaughter of whales for more than two ages that they begin to grow thinner every day and those that are found there seem from their size not come to their full dimensions the greatest whales resort to places where they have the least disturbance to those seas that are on the opposite side of the globe near the south pole in that part of the world there are still to be seen whales that are above an hundred and sixty feet long and perhaps even longer might be found in those latitudes near the south pole to which we have not as yet ventured  taking the whale however at the ordinary size of eighty feet long and twenty feet high what an enormous animated mass must it appear to the spectator with what amazement must it strike him to behold so great a creature gambolling in the deep with the ease and agility of the smallest animal and making its way with incredible swiftness this is a sight which is very common to those who frequent the northern or southern ocean yet though this be wonderful perhaps still greater wonders are concealed in the deep which we have not had opportunities of exploring these large animals are obliged to show themselves in order to take breath but who knows the size of those that are fitted to remain for ever under water and that have been increasing in magnitude for centuries to believe all that has been said of the seaserpent or the kraken would be credulity to reject the possibility of their existence would be presumption  the whale is the largest animal of which we have any certain information and the various purposes to which when taken its different parts are converted have brought us tolerably acquainted with its history of the whale properly so called there are no less than seven different kinds all distinguished from each other by their external figure or internal conformation the great greenland whale without a backfin and black on the back the iceland whale without a backfin and whitish on the back the new england whale with a hump on the back the whale with six humps on the back the finfish with a fin on the back near the tail the pikeheaded whale and the roundlipped whale all these differ from each other in figure as their names obviously imply they differ also somewhat in their manner of living the finfish having a larger swallow than the rest being more active slender and fierce and living chiefly upon herrings however they are none of them very voracious and if compared to the cachalot that enormous tyrant of the deep they appear harmless and gentle the history of the rest therefore may be comprised under that of the great common greenland whale with which we are best acquainted  the great greenland whale is the fish for taking which there are such preparations made in different parts of europe it is a large heavy animal and the head alone makes a third of its bulk it is usually found from sixty to seventy feet long the fins on each side are from five to eight feet composed of bones and muscles and sufficiently strong to give the great mass of body which they move speed and activity the tail which lies flat on the water is about twentyfour feet broad and when the fish lies on one side its blow is tremendous the skin is smooth and black and in some places marbled with white and yellow which running over the surface has a very beautiful effect this marbling is particularly observable in the fins and the tail in the figures which are thus drawn by nature fancy often forms the pictures of trees landscapes and houses in the tail of one that was thus marbled ray tells us that the number     was figured very evenly and exact as if done with a pencil  the whale makes use only of the tail to advance itself forward in the water this serves as a great oar to push its mass along and it is surprising to see with what force and celerity its enormous bulk cuts through the ocean the fins are only made use of for turning in the water and giving a direction to the velocity impressed by the tail the female also makes use of them when pursued to bear off her young clapping them on her back and supporting them by the fins on each side from falling  the outward or scarf skin of the whale is no thicker than parchment but this removed the real skin appears of about an inch thick and covering the fat or blubber that lies beneath this is from eight to twelve inches in thickness and is when the fish is in health of a beautiful yellow the muscles lie beneath and these like the flesh of quadrupedes are very red and tough  the cleft of the mouth is above twenty feet long which is near one third of the animals whole length and the upper jaw is furnished with barbs that lie like the pipes of an organ the greatest in the middle and the smallest to the sides these compose the whalebone the longest spars of which are found to be not less than eighteen feet the shortest being of no value are thrown away the tongue is almost immovably fixed to the lower jaw seeming one great lump of fat and in fact it fills several hogsheads with blubber the eyes are not larger than those of an ox and when the chrystaline humor is dried it does not appear larger than a pea they are placed toward the back of the head being the most convenient situation for enabling them to see both before and behind as also to see over them where their food is principally found they are guarded by eyelids and eyelashes as in quadrupedes and they seem to be very sharpsighted  nor is their sense of hearing in less perfection for they are warned at great distances of any danger preparing against them it would seem as if nature had designedly given them these advantages as they multiply little in order to continue their kind it is true indeed that the external organ of hearing is not perceptible for this might only embarrass them in their natural element but as soon as the thin scarf skin abovementioned is removed a black spot is discovered behind the eye and under that is the auditory canal that leads to a regular apparatus for hearing in short the animal hears the smallest sounds at very great distances and at all times except when it is spouting water which is the time that the fishers approach to strike it  these spoutholes or nostrils in all the cetaceous tribe have been already described in this whale they are two one on each side the head before the eyes and crooked somewhat like the holes on the belly of a violin from these holes this animal blows the water very fiercely and with such a noise that it roars like a hollow wind and may be heard at three miles distance when wounded it then blows more fiercely than ever so that it sounds like the roaring of the sea in a great storm  we have already observed that the substance called whalebone is taken from the upper jaw of the animal and is very different from the real bones of the whale the real bones are hard like those of great land animals are very porous and filled with marrow two great strong bones sustain the under lip lying against each other in the shape of an half moon some of these are twenty feet long they are seen in several gardens set up against each other and are usually mistaken for the ribs of this animal  such is the general conformation and figure of this great inhabitant of the deep the precise anatomy of which has not been yet ascertained in those places where they are caught in greatest abundance the sailors are not very curious as to the structure of the viscera and few anatomists care to undertake a task where the operator instead of separating with a lancet must cut his way with an ax it is as yet doubted therefore whether the whale that in most points internally resembles a quadrupede may not have one great bowel fitted entirely for the reception of air to supply it when constrained to keep longer than usual at the bottom the sailors universally affirm that it has and philosophers have nothing but the analogy of its parts to oppose to their general assertions  as these animals resemble quadrupedes in conformation so they bear a strong resemblance in some of their appetites and manners the female joins with the male as is asserted more humano and once in two years feels the accesses of desire  their fidelity to each other exceeds whatever we are told of even the constancy of birds some fishers as anderson informs us having struck one of two whales a male and a female that were in company together the wounded fish made a long and terrible resistance it struck down a boat with three men in it with a single blow of the tail by which all went to the bottom the other still attended its companion and lent it every assistance till at last the fish that was struck sunk under the number of its wounds while its faithful associate disdaining to survive the loss with great bellowing stretched itself upon the dead fish and shared his fate  the whale goes with young nine or ten months and is then fatter than usual particularly when near the time of bringing forth it is said that the embryo when first perceptible is about seventeen inches long and white but the cub when excluded is black and about ten feet long she generally produces one young one and never above two when she suckles her young she throws herself on one side on the surface of the sea and the young one attaches itself to the tate the breasts are two generally hid within the belly but she can produce them at pleasure so as to stand forward a foot and an half or two feet and the tates are like those of a cow in some the breasts are white in others speckled in all filled with a large quantity of milk resembling that of land animals  nothing can exceed the tenderness of the female for her offspring she carries it with her wherever she goes and when hardest pursued keeps it supported between her fins even when wounded she still clasps her young one and when she plunges to avoid danger takes it to the bottom but rises sooner than usual to give it breath again  the young ones continue at the breast for a year during which time they are called by the sailors shortheads they are then extremely fat and yield above fifty barrels of blubber the mother at the same time is equally lean and emaciated at the age of two years they are called stunts as they do not thrive much immediately after quitting the breast they then yield scarce above twenty or twentyfour barrels of blubber from that time forward they are called skullfish and their age is wholly unknown  every species of whale propagates only with those of its own kind and does not at all mingle with the rest however they are generally seen in shoals of different kinds together and make their migrations in large companies from one ocean to another they are a gregarious animal which implies their want of mutual defense against the invasions of smaller but more powerful fishes it seems astonishing therefore how a shoal of these enormous animals find subsistence together when it would seem that the supplying even one with food would require greater plenty than the ocean could furnish to increase our wonder we not only see them herding together but usually find them fatter than any other animals of whatsoever element we likewise know that they cannot swallow large fishes as their throat is so narrow that an animal larger than an herring could not enter how then do they subsist and grow so fat a small insect which is seen floating in those seas and which linnaeus terms the medusa is sufficient for this supply these insects are black and of the size of a small bean and are sometimes seen floating in clusters on the surface of the water they are of a round form like snails in a box but they have wings which are so tender that it is scarce possible to touch them without breaking these serve rather for swimming than flying and the little animal is called by the icelanders the walfischoas which signifies the whales provender they have the taste of raw muscles and have the smell of burnt sugar these are the food of the whale which it is seen to draw up in great numbers with its huge jaws and to bruise between its barbs which are always found with several of these sticking among them  this is the simple food of the great greenland whale it pursues no other animal leads an inoffensive life in its element and is harmless in proportion to its strength to do mischief there seems to be an analogy between its manners and those of the elephant they are both the strongest and the largest animals in their respective elements neither offer injury but are terrible when provoked to resentment the finfish indeed in some measure differs from the great whale in this particular as it subsists chiefly upon herrings great shoals of which it is often seen driving before it yet even the swallow of this fish is not very large if compared to the cachalot tribe and its ravages are but sports in comparison the stomach and intestines of all these animals when opened seldom have any thing in them except a soft unctuous substance of a brownish color and their excrements are of a shining red  as the whale is an inoffensive animal it is not to be wondered that it has many enemies willing to take advantage of its disposition and inaptitude for combat there is a small animal of the shellfish kind called the whalelouse that sticks to its body as we see shells sticking to the foul bottom of a ship this insinuates itself chiefly under the fins and whatever efforts the great animal makes it still keeps its hold and lives upon the fat which it is provided with instruments to arrive at  the swordfish however is the whales most terrible enemy at the sight of this little animal says anderson the whale seems agitated in an extraordinary manner leaping from the water as if with affright wherever it appears the whale perceives it at a distance and flies from it in the opposite direction i have been myself continues he a spectator of their terrible encounter the whale has no instrument of defense except the tail with that it endeavors to strike the enemy and a single blow taking place would effectually destroy its adversary but the swordfish is as active as the other is strong and easily avoids the stroke then bounding into the air it falls upon its great subjacent enemy and endeavors not to pierce with its pointed beak but to cut with its toothed edges the sea all about is seen dyed with blood proceeding from the wounds of the whale while the enormous animal vainly endeavors to reach its invader and strikes with its tail against the surface of the water making a report at each blow louder than the noise of a cannon  there is still another and more powerful enemy called by the fishermen of new england the killer this is itself a cetaceous animal armed with strong and powerful teeth a number of these are said to surround a whale in the same manner as dogs get round a bull some attack it with their teeth behind others attempt it before until at last the great animal is torn down and its tongue is said to be the only part they devour when they have made it their prey they are said to be of such great strength that one of them alone was known to stop a dead whale that several boats were towing along and drag it from among them to the bottom  but of all the enemies of these enormous fishes man is the greatest he alone destroys more in a year than the rest in an age and actually has thinned their numbers in that part of the world where they are chiefly sought the great resort of these animals was found to be on the inhospitable shores of spitzbergen where the distance of the voyage the coldness of the climate the terrors of the icy sea and still more their own formidable bulk might have been expected to protect them from human injury but all these were but slight barriers against mans arts his courage and his necessities the european ships soon after the improvement of navigation found the way into those seas and as early as the beginning of the fourteenth century the biscayneers were in possession of a very considerable trade to the coasts of greenland the dutch and the english followed them thither and soon took that branch of commerce out of their hands the english commenced the business about the beginning of the seventeenth century and the town of hull had the honor of first attempting that profitable branch of trade but at present it seems upon the decline as the quantity of fish are so greatly reduced by the constant capture for such a vast length of time it is now said that the fishers from a defect of whales apply themselves to the sealfishery yet as these animals are extremely timorous they will soon be induced to quit those shores where they meet such frequent disturbance and danger the poor natives of greenland themselves who used to feed upon the whale are diminishing in proportion as their sustenance is removed and it is probable that the revolution of a few years will see that extensive coast totally deserted by its inhabitants as it is already nearly deserted by the whales  the art of taking whales like most others is much improved by time and differs in many respects from that practiced by the biscayneers when they first frequented the icy sea but as the description of their methods is the least complicated and consequently the easiest understood it will be best suited to our purpose  for this navigation the biscayneers in favorable seasons fitted out thirty ships of two hundred and fifty tons each with fifty choice men apiece and a few boys these were stored with six months provision and each ship had its boats which were to be serviceable when come to the place of duty when arrived at the part where the whales are expected to pass to the southward they always keep their fails set and a sailor is placed at the mast head to give information when he spies a whale as soon as he discovers one the whole crew are instantly in employment they fit out their boats and row away to where the whale was seen the harpooner who is to strike the fish stands at the prow of the boat with an harpoon or javelin in his hand five or six feet long pointed with steel like the barb of an arrow of a triangular shape as this persons place is that of the greatest dexterity so also it is of the greatest danger the whale sometimes overturns the boat with a blow of its tail and sometimes drives against it with fury in general however the animal seems to sleep on the surface of the water while the boat approaching the harpooner stands aloft and with his harpoon tied to a cord of several hundred fathom length darts it into the animal and then rows as fast as possible away it is for some time before the whale seems to feel the blow the instrument has usually pierced no deeper than the fat and that being insensible the animal continues for a while motionless but soon rouzed from its seeming lethargy as the shaft continues to pierce deeper and deeper into the muscular flesh it flies off with amazing rapidity in the mean time the harpoon sticks in its side while the rope which is coiled up in the boat and runs upon a swivel lengthens as the whale recedes but still shows the part of the deep to which it has retreated the cord is coiled up with great care for such is the rapidity with which it runs off that if it was but the least checked as it yields with the animals retreat it would infallibly overset the boat and the crew would go to the bottom it sometimes happens also that the rapidity with which it runs over the swivel at the edge of the boat heats it and it would infallibly take fire did not a man stand continually with a wet mop in his hand to cool the swivel as the cord runs the whale having dived to a considerable depth remains at the bottom sometimes for near half an hour with the harpoon in its body and then rises to take breath expecting the danger over but the instant it appears they are all with their boats ready to receive it and fling their harpoons into its body the animal again dives and again rises while they repeat their blows the ship follows in full sail like all the rest never losing sight of the boats and ready to lend them assistance the whole ocean seems dyed in blood thus they renew their attacks till the whale begins to be quite enfeebled and spent when they plunge their longer spears into various parts of its body and the enormous animal expires when it is dead to prevent it from sinking they tie it with a strong iron chain to the side of the boat and either cut it up in pieces and carry it home in that manner or extract the oil from the blubber on shipboard  such is the manner in which these fish were taken in the beginning but succeeding arts have improved the method and the harpoon is now thrown by a machine being used which inflicts a deeper wound and strikes the animal with much greater certainty there are better methods for extracting the oil and properer machines for cutting the animal up than were used in the early fisheries but as an account of this belongs to the history of art and not of nature we must be contented with observing that several parts of this animal and all but the intestines and the bones are turned to very good account not only the oil but the greaves from which it is separated the barbs also were an article of great profit but have sunk in their price since women no longer use them to swell out their petticoats with whalebone the flesh of this animal is also a dainty to some nations and even the french seamen are now and then found to dress and use it as their ordinary diet at sea it is said by the english and dutch sailors to be hard and illtasted but the french assert the contrary and the savages of greenland as well as those near the south pole are fond of it to distraction they eat the flesh and drink the oil which is a first rate delicacy the finding a dead whale is an adventure considered among the fortunate circumstances of their wretched lives they make their abode beside it and seldom remove till they have left nothing but the bones  jacobson whom we quoted before in the history of birds where he describes his countrymen of the island of feroe as living a part of the year upon salted gulls tells us also that they are very fond of salted whales flesh the fat of the head they season with bay salt and then hang it up to dry in the chimney he thinks it tastes as well as fat bacon and the lean which they boil is in his opinion not inferior to beef i fancy poor jacobson would make but an indifferent taster at one of our city feasts  chap iv of the narwhal from whales that entirely want teeth we come to such as have them in the upper jaw only and in this class there is found but one the narwhal or seaunicorn this fish is not so large as the whale not being above sixty feet long its body is slenderer than that of the whale and its fat not in so great abundance but this great animal is sufficiently distinguished from all others of the deep by its tooth or teeth which stand pointing directly forward from the upper jaw and are from nine to fourteen feet long in all the variety of weapons with which nature has armed her various tribes there is not one so large or so formidable as this this terrible weapon is generally found single and some are of opinion that the animal is furnished but with one by nature but there is at present the skull of a narwhal at the stadthouse at amsterdam with two teeth which plainly proves that in some animals at least this instrument is double it is even a doubt whether it may not be so in all and that the narwhals wanting a tooth is only an accident which it has met with in the encounters it is obliged daily to be engaged in yet it must be owned of these that are taken only with one tooth there seems no socket nor no remains of any other upon the opposite side of the jaw but all is plain and even however this be the tooth or as some are pleased to call it the horn of the narwhal is the most terrible of all natural instruments of destruction it is as straight as an arrow about the thickness of the small of a mans leg wreathed in the manner we sometimes see twisted bars of iron it tapers to a sharp point and is whiter heavier and harder than ivory it is generally seen to spring from the left side of the head directly forward in a straight line with the body and its root enters into the socket above a foot and an half in a skull to be seen at hamburgh there are two teeth which are each above seven feet long and are eight inches in circumference when the animal possessed of these formidable weapons is urged to employ them it drives directly forward against the enemy with its teeth that like portended spears pierce whatever stands before them  the extreme length of these instruments have induced some to consider them rather as horns than teeth but they in every respect resemble the tusks of the boar and the elephant they grow as in them from sockets in the upper jaw they have the solidity of the hardest bone and far surpass ivory in all its qualities the same error has led others to suppose that as among quadrupedes the female was often found without horns so these instruments of defense were only to be found in the male but this has been more than once refuted by actual experience both sexes are found armed in this manner the horn is sometimes found wreathed and sometimes smooth sometimes a little bent and sometimes straight but always strong deeply fixed and sharply pointed  yet notwithstanding all these appointments for combat these long and pointed tusks amazing strength and unmatchable celerity the narwhal is one of the most harmless and peaceful inhabitants of the ocean it is seen constantly and inoffensively sporting among the other great monsters of the deep no way attempting to injure them but pleased in their company the greenlanders call the narwhal the forerunner of the whale for wherever it is seen the whale is shortly after sure to follow this may arise as well from the natural passion for society in these animals as from both living upon the same food which are the insects described in the preceding chapter these powerful fishes make war upon no other living creature and though furnished with instruments to spread general destruction are as innocent and as peaceful as a drove of oxen nay so regardless are they of their own weapons and so utterly unmindful to keep them in repair for engagement that they are constantly seen covered over with weeds slough and all the filth of the sea they seem rather considered as an impediment than a defense  the manners and appetites both of the narwhal and the great whale are entirely similar they both alike want teeth for chewing and are obliged to live upon insects they both are peaceable and harmless and always rather fly than seek the combat the narwhal however has a much narrower gape than the great whale and therefore does not want the use of barbs to keep in its food when once sucked into the mouth it is also much swifter and would never be taken by the fisherman but for those very tusks which at first appear to be its principal defense these animals as was said being fond of living together are always seen in herds of several at a time and whenever they are attacked they crowd together in such a manner that they are mutually embarassed by their tusks by these they are often locked together and are prevented from sinking to the bottom it seldom happens therefore but the fishermen make sure of one or two of the hindmost which very well reward their trouble  it is from the extraordinary circumstance of the teeth therefore that this fish demands a distinct history and such has been the curiosity of mankind and their desire to procure them that a century ago they were considered as the greatest rarity in the world at that time the art of catching whales was not known and mankind saw few except such as were stranded on the coasts by accident the tooth of the narwhal therefore was ascribed to a very different animal from that which really bore it among other fossil substances they were sometimes dug up and the narwhal being utterly unknown naturalists soon found a terrestrial owner they were thought to be the horns of unicorns an animal described by pliny as resembling an horse and with one straight horn darting forward from the middle of its forehead these teeth were therefore considered as a strong testimony in favor of that historians veracity and were shown among the most precious remains of antiquity even for some time after the narwhal was known the deceit was continued as those who were possessed of a tooth sold it to great advantage but at present they are too well known to deceive any and are only shown for what they really are their curiosity increasing in proportion to their weight and their size  chap v of the cachalot and its varieties the cachalot which has generally gone under the name of the spermaceti whale till mr penant very properly made the distinction by borrowing its name from the french has several teeth in the underjaw but none in the upper as there are no less than seven distinctions among whales so also there are the same number of distinctions in the tribe we are describing the cachalot with two fins and a black back the cachalot with two fins and a whitish back that with a spout in the neck that with the spout in the snout that with three fins and sharp pointed teeth that with three fins and sharp edged teeth and lastly the cachalot with three fins and flatted teeth  this tribe is not of such enormous size as the whale properly so called not being above sixty feet long and sixteen feet high in consequence of their being more slender they are much more active than the common whale they remain a longer time at the bottom and afford a smaller quantity of oil as in the common whale the head was seen to make a third part of its bulk so in this species the head is so large as to make one half of the whole the tongue of this animal is small but the throat is very formidable and with very great ease it could swallow an ox in the stomach of the whale scarce any thing is to be found but in that of the cachalot there are loads of fish of different kinds some whole some half digested some small and others eight or nine feet long the cachalot is therefore as destructive among lesser fishes as the whale is harmless and can at one gulp swallow a shoal of fishes down its enormous gullet linnaeus tells us that this fish pursues and terrifies the dolphins and porpoises so much as often to drive them on shore  but how formidable soever this fish may be to its fellows of the deep it is by far the most valuable and the most sought after by man as it contains two very precious drugs spermaceti and ambergrease the use of these either for the purposes of luxury or medicine is so universal that the capture of this animal that alone supplies them turns out to very great advantage particularly since the art has been found out of converting all the oil of this animal as well as the brain into that substance called spermaceti  this substance as it is naturally formed is found in the head of the animal and is no other than the brain the outward skin of the head being taken off a covering of fat offers about three inches thick and under that instead of a bony skull the animal has only another thick skin that serves for a covering and defense of the brain the first cavity or chamber of the brain is filled with that spermaceti which is supposed of the greatest purity and highest value from this cavity there is generally drawn about seven barrels of the clearest spermaceti that thrown upon water coagulates like cheese below this there is another chamber just over the gullet which is about seven feet high and this also contains the drug but of less value it is distributed in this cavity like honey in a hive in small cells separated from each other by a membrane like the inner skin of an egg in proportion as the oily substance is drawn away from this part it fills anew from every part of the body and from this is generally obtained about nine barrels of oil besides this the spinal marrow which is about as thick as a mans thigh and reaches all along the backbone to the tail where it is not thicker than ones finger affords no inconsiderable quantity  this substance which is used in the composition of many medicines rather to give them consistence than efficacy was at first sold at a very high price both from the many virtues ascribed to it and the small quantity that the cachalot was capable of supplying at present the price is greatly fallen first because its efficacy in medicine is found to be very small and again because the whole oil of the fish is very easily convertible into spermaceti this is performed by boiling it with a lea of potash and hardening it in the manner of soap candles are now made of it which are substituted for wax and sold much cheaper so that we need not fear having our spermaceti adulterated in the manner some medical books caution us to beware of for they carefully guard us against having our spermaceti adulterated with virgins wax  as to the amber grease which is sometimes found in this whale it was long considered as a substance found floating on the surface of the sea but time that reveals the secrets of the mercenary has discovered that it chiefly belongs to this animal the name which has been improperly given to the former substance seems more justly to belong to this for the amber grease is found in the place where the seminal vessels are usually situated in other animals it is found in a bag of three or four feet long in round lumps from one to twenty pounds weight floating in a fluid rather thinner than oil and of a yellowish color there are never seen more than four at a time in one of these bags and that which weighed twenty pounds and which was the largest ever seen was found single these balls of amber grease are not found in all fishes of this kind but chiefly in the oldest and strongest the uses of this medicine for the purposes of luxury and as a perfume are well known though upon some subjects ignorance is preferable to information  chap vi of the dolphin the grampus and the porpus with their varieties all these fish have teeth both in the upper and the lower jaw and are much less than the whale the grampus which is the largest never exceeds twenty feet it may also be distinguished by the flatness of its head which resembles a boat turned upside down the porpus resembles the grampus in most things except the snout which is not above eight feet long its snout also more resembles that of an hog the dolphin has a strong resemblance to the porpus except that its snout is longer and more pointed they have all fins on the back they all have heads very large like the rest of of the whalekind and resemble each other in their appetites their mannners and conformations being equally voracious active and roving  the great agility of these animals prevents their often being taken they seldom remain a moment above water sometimes indeed their too eager pursuits expose them to danger and a shoal of herrings often allures them out of their depth in such a case the hungry animal continues to flounder in the shallows till knocked on the head or till the retiring tide seasonably comes to its relief but all this tribe and the dolphin in particular are not less swift than destructive no fish could escape them but from the awkward position of the mouth which is placed in a manner under the head yet even with these disadvantages their depredations are so great that they have been justly styled the plunderers of the deep  what could induce the ancients to a predilection in favor of these animals particularly the dolphin it is not easy to account for historians and philosophers seem to have contended who should invent the greatest number of fables concerning them the dolphin was celebrated in the earliest time for its fondness to the human race and was distinguished by the epithets of the boyloving and philanthropist scarce an accident could happen at sea but the dolphin offered himself to convey the unfortunate to shore the musician flung into the sea by pirates the boy taking an airing into the midst of the sea and returning again in safety were obliged to the dolphin for its services it is not easy i say to assign a cause why the ancients should thus have invented so many fables in their favor the figure of these animals is far from prejudicing us in their interests their extreme rapacity tends still less to endear them i know nothing that can reconcile them to man and excite his prejudices except that when taken they sometimes have a plaintiff moan with which they continue to express their pain till they expire this at first might have excited human pity and that might have produced affection at present these fishes are regarded even by the vulgar in a very different light their appearance is far from being esteemed a favorable omen by the seamen and from their boundings springs and frolics in the water experience has taught the mariners to prepare for a storm  but it is not to one circumstance only that the ancients have confined their fabulous reports concerning these animals as from their leaps out of their element they assume a temporary curvature which is by no means their natural figure in the water the old painters and sculptors have universally drawn them wrong a dolphin is scarce ever exhibited by the ancients in a straight shape but curved in the position which they sometimes appear in when exerting their force and the poets too have adopted the general error even pliny the best naturalist has asserted that they instantly die when taken out of the water but rondelet on the contrary assures us that he has seen a dolphin carried alive from montpellier to lions  the moderns have more just notions of these animals and have got over the many fables which every days experience contradicts indeed their numbers are so great and though shy they are so often taken that such peculiarities if they were possessed of any would have been long since ascertained they are found the porpess especially in such vast numbers in all parts of the sea that surrounds this kingdom that they are sometimes noxious to seamen when they sail in small vessels in some places they almost darken the water as they rise to take breath and particularly before bad weather are much agitated swimming against the wind and tumbling about with unusual violence  whether these motions be the gambols of pleasure or the agitations of terror is not well known it is most probable that they dread those seasons of turbulence when the lesser fishes shrink to the bottom and their prey no longer offers in sufficient abundance in times of fairer weather they are seen herding together and pursuing shoals of various fish with great impetuosity their method of hunting their game if it may be so called is to follow in a pack and thus give each other mutual assistance at that season when the mackarel the herring the salmon and other fish of passage begin to make their appearance the cetaceous tribes are seen fierce in the pursuit urging their prey from one creek or bay to another deterring them from the shallows driving them toward each others ambush and using a greater variety of arts than hounds are seen to exert in pursuing the hare however the porpess not only seeks for prey near the surface but often descends to the bottom in search of sandeels and seaworms which it roots out of the sand with its nose in the manner hogs harrow up the fields for food for this purpose the nose projects a little is shorter and stronger than that of the dolphin and the neck is furnished with very strong muscles which enable it the readier to turn up the sand  but it sometimes happens that the impetuosity or the hunger of these animals in their usual pursuits urges them beyond the limits of safety the fishermen who extend their long nets for pilchards on the coasts of cornwall have sometimes an unwelcome capture in one of these their feeble nets which are calculated only for taking smaller prey suffer an universal laceration from the efforts of this strong animal to escape and if it be not knocked on the head before it has had time to flounder the nets are destroyed and the fishery interrupted there is nothing therefore they so much dread as the entangling a porpess and they do every thing to intimidate the animal from approaching  indeed these creatures are so violent in the pursuit of their prey that they sometimes follow a shoal of small fishes up a fresh water river from whence they find no small difficulty to return we have often seen them taken in the thames at london both above the bridges and below them it is curious enough to observe with what activity they avoid their pursuers and what little time they require to fetch breath above the water the manner of killing them is for four or five boats to spread over the part of the river in which they are seen and with firearms to shoot at them the instant they rise above the water the fish being thus for some time kept in agitation requires to come to the surface at quicker intervals and thus affords the marksmen more frequent opportunities  when the porpess is taken it becomes no inconsiderable capture as it yields a very large quantity of oil and the lean of some particularly if the animal be young is said to be as well tasted as veal the inhabitants of norway prepare from the eggs found in the body of this fish a kind of caviar which is said to be very delicate sauce or good when even eaten with bread there is a fishery for porpess along the western isles of scotland during the summer season when they abound on that shore and this branch of industry turns to good advantage  as for the rest we are told that these animals go with young ten months that like the whale they seldom bring forth above one at a time and that in the midst of summer that they live to a considerable age though some say not above twenty five or thirty years and they sleep with the snout above water they seem to possess in a degree proportioned to their bulk the manners of whales and the history of one species of cetaceous animals will in a great measure serve for all the rest  part ii of cartilaginous fishes chap i of cartilaginous fishes in general we have seen that fishes of the cetaceous kind bear a strong resemblance to quadrupedes in their conformation those of the cartilaginous kinds are one remove separated from them they form the shade that completes the imperceptible gradations of nature  the first great distinction they exhibit is in having cartilages or gristles instead of bones the cetaceous tribes have their bones entirely resembling those of quadrupedes thick white and filled with marrow those of the spinous kind on the contrary have small slender bones with points resembling thorns and generally solid throughout fishes of the cartilaginous kinds have their bones always soft and yielding and age that hardens the bones of other animals rather contributes still more to soften theirs the size of all fishes increases with age but from the pliancy of the bones in this tribe they seem to have no bounds placed to their dimensions and it is supposed that they grow larger every day till they die  they have other differences more obviously discernible we have observed that the cetaceous tribes had lungs like quadrupedes an heart with its partition in the same manner and an apparatus for hearing on the other hand we mentioned that the spinous kinds had no organs of hearing no lungs to breathe through and no partition in the heart but that their cold red blood was circulated by the means of the impulse made upon their gills by the water cartilaginous fishes unite both these systems in their conformation like the cetaceous tribes they have organs of hearing and lungs like the spinous kinds they have gills and an heart without a partition thus possessed of a twofold power of breathing sometimes by means of their lungs sometimes by that of their gills they seem to unite all the advantages of which their situation is capable and drawing from both elements every aid to their necessities or their enjoyments  this double capacity of breathing in these animals is one of the most remarkable features in the history of nature the apertures by which they breathe are somewhere placed about the head either beneath as in flat fish on the sides as in sharks or on the top of the head as in pipefish to these apertures are the gills affixed but without any bone to open and shut them as in spinous fishes from which by this mark they may be easily distinguished though otherwise very much alike in appearance from these are bending cylindrical ducts that run to the lungs and are supposed to convey the air that gives the organs their proper play the heart however has but one valve so that their blood wants that double circulation which obtains in the cetaceous kinds and the lungs seem to me rather as an internal assistant to the gills than fitted for supplying the same offices as in quadrupedes for they want the pulmonary vein and artery  from this structure however the animal is enabled to live a longer time out of water than those whose gills are more simple the cartilaginous shark or ray live some hours after they are taken while the spinous herring or mackarel expire a few minutes after they are brought on shore from hence this tribe seems possessed of powers that other fishes are wholly deprived of they can remain continually under water without ever taking breath while they can venture their heads above the deep and continue for hours out of their native element  we observed in a former chapter that spinous fishes have not or at least appear not to have externally any instruments of generation it is very different with those of the cartilaginous kind for the male always has these instruments double the fish of this tribe are not unfrequently seen to copulate and their manner is belly to belly such as may naturally be expected from animals whose parts of generation are placed forward they in general choose colder seasons and situations than other fish for propagating their kind and many of them bring forth in the midst of winter  the same duplicity of character which marks their general conformation obtains also with regard to their manner of bringing forth some bring forth their young alive and some bring forth eggs which are afterward brought to maturity in all however the manner of gestation is nearly the same for upon dissection it is ever found that the young while in the body continue in the egg till a very little time before they are excluded these eggs they may properly be said to hatch within their body and as soon as their young quit the shell they begin to quit the womb also unlike to quadrupedes or the cetaceous tribes that quit the egg state a few days after their first conception and continue in the womb several months after these continue in the body of the female in their egg state for weeks together and the eggs are found linked together by a membrane from which when the faetus gets free it continues but a very short time till it delivers itself from its confinement in the womb the eggs themselves consist of a white and a yolk and have a substance instead of shell that aptly may be compared to softened horn these as i observed are sometimes hatched in the womb as in the shark and ray kinds and they are sometimes excluded as in the sturgeon before the animal comes to its time of disengaging thus we see that there seems very little difference between the viviparous and the oviparous kinds in this class of fishes the one hatch their eggs in the womb and the young continue no long time there the others exclude their eggs before hatching and leave it to time and accident to bring their young to maturity  such are the peculiar marks of the cartilaginous class of fishes of which there are many kinds to give a distinct description of every fish is as little my intention as perhaps it is the wish of the reader but the peculiarities of each kind deserve notice and the most striking of these it would be unpardonable to omit  cartilaginous fish may be divided first into those of the shark kind with a body growing less toward the tail a rough skin with the mouth placed far beneath the end of the nose five apertures on the sides of the neck for breathing and the upper part of the tail longer than the lower this class chiefly comprehends the great white shark the balance fish the hound fish the monk fish the dog fish the basking shark the zygaena the tope the cat fish the blue shark the sea fox the smooth hound fish and the porbeagle these are all of the same nature and differ more in size than in figure or conformation  the next division is that of flat fish and these their broad flat thin shape is sufficiently capable of distinguishing from all others of this kind they may be easily distinguished also from spinous flat fish by the holes through which they breathe which are uncovered by a bone and which in this kind are five on each side in this tribe we may place the torpedo the skate the sharpnosed ray the rough ray the thornback and the fire flare  the third division is that of the slender snakeshaped kind such as the lamprey the pride and the pipe fish  the fourth division is of the sturgeon and its variety the isingglass fish  the last division may comprize fish of different figures and natures that do not rank under the former divisions these are the sun fish the tetrodon the lump fish the sea snail the chimaera and the fishing frog each of these has somewhat peculiar in its powers or its form that deserves to be remarked the description of the figures of these at least may compensate for our general ignorance of the rest of their history  chap ii of cartilaginous fishes of the shark kind of all the inhabitants of the deep those of the shark kind are the fiercest and the most voracious the smallest of this tribe is not less dreaded by greater fish than many that to appearance seem more powerful nor do any of them seem fearful of attacking animals far above their size but the great white shark which is the largest of the kind joins to the most amazing rapidity the strongest appetites for mischief as he approaches nearly in size to the whale he far surpasses him in strength and celerity in the formidable arrangement of his teeth and his insatiable desire of plunder  the white shark is sometimes seen to rank even among whales for magnitude and is found from twenty to thirty feet long some assert that they have seen them of four thousand pound weight and we are told particularly of one that had a human corpse in his belly the head is large and somewhat flatted the snout long and the eyes large the mouth is enormously wide as is the throat and capable of swallowing a man with great ease but its furniture of teeth is still more terrible of these there are six rows extremely hard sharppointed and of a wedgelike figure it is asserted that there are seventytwo in each jaw which make one hundred and fortyfour in the whole yet others think that their number is uncertain and that in proportion as the animal grows older these terrible instruments of destruction are found to increase with these the jaws both above and below appear planted all over but the animal has a power of erecting or depressing them at pleasure when the shark is at rest they lie quite flat in his mouth but when he prepares to seize his prey he erects all this dreadful apparatus by the help of a set of muscles that join them to the jaw and the animal he seizes dies pierced with an hundred wounds in a moment  nor is this fish less terrible to behold as to the rest of his form his fins are larger in proportion he is furnished with great goggle eyes that he turns with ease on every side so as to see his prey behind him as well as before and his whole aspect is marked with a character of malignity his skin also is rough hard and prickly being that substance which covers instrument cases called shagreen  as the shark is thus formidable in his appearance so is he also dreadful from his courage and activity no fish can swim so fast as he none so constantly employed in swimming he outstrips the swiftest ships plays round them darts out before them returns seems to gaze at the passengers and all the while does not seem to exhibit the smallest symptom of an effort to proceed such amazing powers with such great appetites for destruction would quickly unpeople even the ocean but providentially the sharks upper jaw projects so far above the lower that he is obliged to turn on one side not on his back as is generally supposed to seize his prey as this takes some small time to perform the animal pursued seizes that opportunity to make its escape  still however the depredations he commits are frequent and formidable the shark is the dread of sailors in all hot climates where like a greedy robber he attends the ships in expectation of what may drop over board a man who unfortunately falls into the sea at such a time is sure to perish without mercy a sailor that was bathing in the mediterranean near antibes in the year      while he was swimming about fifty yards from the ship perceived a monstrous fish making toward him and surveying him on every side as fish are often seen to look round a bait the poor man struck with terror at its approach cried out to his companions in the vessel to take him on board they accordingly threw him a rope with the utmost expedition and were drawing him up by the ships side when the shark darted after him from the deep and snapped off his leg  mr penant tells us that the master of a guineaship finding a rage for suicide prevail among his slaves from a notion the unhappy creatures had that after death they should be restored again to their families friends and country to convince them at least that some disgrace should attend them here he ordered one of their dead bodies to be tied by the heels to a rope and so let down into the sea and though it was drawn up again with great swiftness yet in that short space the sharks had bit off all but the feet whether this story is prior to an accident of the same kind which happened at belfast in ireland about twenty years ago i will not take upon me to determine but certain it is there are some circumstances alike in both though more terrible in that i am going to relate a guinea captain was by stress of weather driven into the harbor of belfast with a lading of very sickly slaves who in the manner abovementioned took every opportunity to throw themselves over board when brought up upon deck as is usual for the benefit of the fresh air the captain perceiving among others a woman slave attempting to drown herself pitched upon her as a proper example to the rest as he supposed that they did not know the terrors attending death he ordered the woman to be tied with a rope under the armpits and so let her down into the water when the poor creature was thus plunged in and about half way down she was heard to give a terrible shriek which at first was ascribed to her fears of drowning but soon after the water appearing red all round her she was drawn up and it was found that a shark which had followed the ship had bit her off from the middle  such is the frightful rapacity of this animal nothing that has life is rejected but it seems to have a peculiar enmity to man when once it has tasted human flesh it never desists from haunting those places where it expects the return of its prey it is even asserted that along the coasts of africa where these animals are found in great abundance numbers of the negroes who are obliged to frequent the waters are seized and devoured by them every year the people of these coasts are firmly of opinion that the shark loves the black mans flesh in preference to the white and that when men of different colors are in the water together it always makes choice of the former  however this be men of all colors are equally afraid of this animal and have contrived different methods to destroy him in general they derive their success from the sharks own rapacity the usual method of our sailors to take him is by baiting a great hook with a piece of beef or pork which is thrown out into the sea by a strong cord strengthened near the hook with an iron chain without this precaution the shark would quickly bite the cord in two and thus set himself free it is no unpleasant amusement to observe this voracious animal coming up to survey the bait particularly when not pressed by hunger he approaches it examines it swims round it seems for a while to neglect it perhaps apprehensive of the cord and the chain he quits it for a little but his appetite pressing he returns again appears preparing to devour it but quits it once more when the sailors have sufficiently diverted themselves with his different evolutions they then make a pretense by drawing the rope as if intending to take the bait away it is then that the gluttons hunger excites him he darts at the bait and swallows it hook and all sometimes however he does not so entirely gorge the whole but that he once more gets free yet even then though wounded and bleeding with the hook he will again pursue the bait until he is taken when he finds the hook lodged in his maw his utmost efforts are then excited but in vain to get free he tries with his teeth to cut the chain he pulls with all his force to break the line he almost seems to turn his stomach inside out to disgorge the hook in this manner he continues his formidable though fruitless efforts till quite spent he suffers his head to be drawn above water and the sailors confining his tail by a nooze in this manner draw him on ship board and dispatch him this is done by beating him on the head till he dies yet even that is not effected without difficulty and danger the enormous creature terrible even in the agonies of death still struggles with his destroyers nor is there an animal in the world that is harder to be killed even when cut in pieces the muscles still preserve their motion and vibrate for some minutes after being separated from the body another method of taking him is by striking a barbed instrument called a fizgig into his body as he brushes along by the side of the ship as soon as he is taken up to prevent his flouncing they cut off the tail with an ax with the utmost expedition  this is the manner in which europeans destroy the shark but some of the negroes along the african coast take a bolder and more dangerous method to combat their terrible enemy armed with nothing more than a knife the negroe plunges into the water where he sees the shark watching for his prey and boldly swims forward to meet him though the great animal does not come to provoke the combat he does not avoid it and suffers the man to approach him but just as he turns upon his side to seize the aggressor the negroe watches the opportunity plunges his knife in the fishs belly and pursues his blows with such success that he lays the ravenous tyrant dead at the bottom he soon however returns fixes the fishs head in a nooze and drags him to shore where he makes a noble feast for the adjacent villages  nor is man alone the only enemy this fish has to fear the remora or sucking fish is probably a still greater and follows the shark every where this fish has got a power of adhering to whatever it sticks against in the same manner as a cuppingglass sticks to the human body it is by such an apparatus that this animal sticks to the shark and drains away its moisture the seamen however are of opinion that it is seen to attend on the shark for more friendly purposes to point him to his prey and to apprize him of his danger for this reason it has been called the sharks pilot  the shark so much resembles the whale in size that some have injudiciously ranked it in the class of cetaceous fishes but its real rank is in the place here assigned it among those of the cartilaginous kind it breathes with gills and lungs its bones are gristly and it brings forth several living young belonius assures us that he saw a female shark produce eleven live young ones at a time but i will not take upon me to vouch for the veracity of rondeletius who when talking of the blue shark says that the female will permit her small brood when in danger to swim down her mouth and take shelter in her belly mr penant indeed seems to give credit to the story and thinks that this fish like the oppossum may have a place fitted by nature for the reception of her young to his opinion much deference is due and is sufficient at least to make us suspend our assent for nothing is so contemptible as that affectation of wisdom which some display by universal incredulity  upon the whole a shark when living is a very formidable animal and when dead is of very little value the flesh is hardly digestible by any but the negroes who are fond of it to distraction the liver affords three or four quarts of oil some imaginary virtues have been ascribed to the brain and its skin is by great labor polished into that substance called shagreen mr penant is of opinion that the female is larger than the male in all this tribe which would if confirmed by experience make a striking agreement between them and birds of prey it were to be wished that succeeding historians would examine into this observation which is offered only as a conjecture  chap iii of cartilaginous flatfish or the ray kind the same rapacity which impels the shark along the surface of the water actuates the flat fish at the bottom less active and less formidable they creep in security along the bottom seize every thing that comes in their way neither the hardest shells nor the sharpest spines give protection to the animals that bear them their insatiable hunger is such that they devour all and the force of their stomach is so great that it easily digests them  the whole of this kind resemble each other very strongly in their figure nor is it easy without experience to distinguish one from another the stranger to this dangerous tribe may imagine he is only handling a skate when he is instantly struck numb by the torpedo he may suppose he has caught a thornback till he is stung by the fireflare it will be proper therefore after describing the general figure of these animals to mark their differences  all fish of the ray kind are broad cartilaginous swimming flat on the water and having spines on different parts of their body or at depiction of the ray and the torpedo electric ray the ray v   p       the torpedo v   p      e martin sc  the tail they all have their eyes and mouth placed quite under the body with apertures for breathing either about or near them they all have teeth or a rough bone which answers the same purpose their bowels are very wide toward the mouth and go on diminishing to the tail the tail is very differently shaped from that of other fishes and at first sight more resembling that of a quadrupede being narrow and ending either in a bunch or a point but what they are chiefly distinguished by is their spines or prickles which the different species have on different parts of their body some are armed with spines both above and below others have them on the upper part only some have their spines at the tail some have three rows of them and others but one these prickles in some are comparatively soft and feeble those of others strong and piercing the smallest of these spines are usually inclining toward the tail the larger toward the head  it is by the spines that these animals are distinguished from each other the skate has the middle of the back rough and a single row of spines on the tail the sharp nosed ray has ten spines that are situated toward the middle of the back the rough ray has its spines spread indiscriminately over the the whole back the thornback has its spines disposed in three rows upon the back the fire flare has but one spine but that indeed a terrible one this dangerous weapon is placed on the tail about four iches from the body and is not less than five inches long it is of a flinty hardness the sides thin sharp pointed and closely and sharply bearded the whole way the last of this tribe that i shall mention is the torpedo and this animal has no spines that can wound but in the place of them it is possessed of one of the most potent and extraordinary faculties in nature  such are the principal differences that may enable us to distinguish animals some of which are of very great use to mankind from others that are terrible and noxious with respect to their uses indeed as we shall soon see they differ much but the similitude among them as to their nature appetites and conformation is perfect and entire they are all as voracious as they are plenty and as dangerous to a stranger as useful to him who can distinguish their differences  of all the larger fish of the sea these are the most numerous and they owe their numbers to their size except the white shark and cachalot alone there is no other fish that has a swallow large enough to take them in and their spines make them a still more dangerous morsel yet the size of some is such that even the shark himself is unable to devour them we have seen some of them in england weigh above two hundred pounds but that is nothing to their enormous bulk in other parts of the world labat tells us of a prodigious ray that was speared by the negroes at guadaloupe which was thirteen feet eight inches broad and above ten feet from the snout to the insertion of the tail the tail itself was in proportion for it was no less than fifteen feet long twenty inches broad at its insertion and tapering to a point the body was two feet in depth the skin as thick as leather and marked with spots which spots in all of this kind are only glands that supply a mucous to lubricate and soften the skin this enormous fish was utterly unfit to be eaten by the europeans but the negroes chose out some of the nicest bits and carefully salted them up as a most favorite provision  yet large as this may seem it is very probable that we have seen only the smallest of the kind as they generally keep at the bottom the largest of the kind are seldom seen and as they may probably have been growing for ages the extent of their magnitude is unknown it is generally supposed however that they are the largest inhabitants of the deep and were we to credit the norway bishop there are some above a mile over but to suppose an animal of such magnitude is absurd yet the overstretching the supposition does not destroy the probability that animals of this tribe grow to an enormous size  the ray generally chooses for its retreat such parts of the sea as have a black muddy bottom the large ones keep at greater depths but the smaller approach the shores and feed upon whatever living animals they can surprise or whatever putrid substances they meet with as they are ravenous they easily take the bait yet will not touch it if it be taken up and kept a day or two out of water almost all fish appear much more delicate with regard to a baited hook than their ordinary food they appear by their manner to perceive the line and to dread it but the impulse of their hunger is too great for their caution and even though they perceive the danger if thoroughly hungry they devour the destruction  these fish generate in march and april at which time only they are seen swimming near the surface of the water several of the males pursuing one female they adhere so fast together in coition that the fishermen frequently draw up both together though only one has been hooked the females are prolific to an extreme degree there having been no less than three hundred eggs taken out of the body of a single ray these eggs are covered with a tough horny substance which they acquire in the womb for before they descend into that they are attached to the ovary pretty much in the same manner as in the body of a pullet from this ovary or eggbag as it is vulgarly called the fishs eggs drop one by one into the womb and there receive a shell by the concretion of the fluids of that organ when come to the proper maturity they are excluded but never above one or two at a time and often at intervals of three or four hours these eggs or purses as the fishermen call them are usually cast about the beginning of may and they continue casting during the whole summer in october when their breeding ceases they are exceedingly poor and thin but in november they begin to improve and grow gradually better till may when they are in the highest perfection  it is chiefly during the winter season that our fishermen take them but the dutch who are indefatigable begin their operations earlier and fish with better success than we the method practiced by the fishermen of scarborough is thought to be the best among the english and as mr penant has given a very succinct account of it i will take leave to present it to the reader  when they go out to fish each person is provided with three lines each mans lines are fairly coiled upon a flat oblong piece of wicker work the hooks being baited and placed very regularly in the center of the coil each line is furnished with two hundred and eighty hooks at the distance of six feet two inches from each other the hooks are fastened to lines of twisted horsehair twentyseven inches in length when fishing there are always three men in each coble and consequently nine of these lines are fastened together and used as one line extending in length near three miles and furnished with above two thousand five hundred hooks an anchor and a buoy are fixed at the first end of the line and one more at each end of each mans lines in all four anchors and four buoys made of leather or cork the line is always laid across the current the tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon our coast and when undisturbed by winds run each way about six hours they are so rapid that the fishermen can only shoot and haul their lines at the turn of the tide and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about six hours the same rapidity of tide prevents their using hand lines and therefore two of the people commonly wrap themselves in the sail and sleep while the other keeps a strict lookout for fear of being run down by ships and to observe the weather for storms often rise so suddenly that it is sometimes with extreme difficulty they escape to the shore though they leave lines behind them  the coble is twenty feet six inches long and five feet extreme breadth it is about one ton burden rowed with three pair of oars and admirably constructed for the purpose of encountering a mountainous sea they hoist sail when the wind suits  the fivemenboat is forty feet long fifteen broad and twentyfive tons burden it is so called though navigated by six men and a boy because one of the men is hired to cook and does not share in the profits with the other five all our able fishermen go in these boats to the herringfishery at yarmouth the latter end of september and return about the middle of november the boats are then laid up until the beginning of lent at which time they go off in them to the edge of the dogger and other places to fish for turbot cod ling skates etc they always take two cobles on board and when they come upon their ground anchor the boat throw out the cobles and fish in the same manner as those do who go from the shore in a coble with this difference only that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines and instead of waiting the return of the tide in the coble return to the boat and bait their other lines thus hawling one set and shooting another every turn of tide they commonly run into the harbor twice a week to deliver their fish the fivemenboat is decked at each end but open in the middle and has two long sails  the best bait for all kinds of fish is fresh herring cut in pieces of a proper size and notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary they are taken there at any time in the winter and all the spring whenever the fishermen put down their nets for that purpose the fivemen boats always take some nets for that end next to herrings are the lesser lampreys which come all winter by landcarriage from tadcaster the next baits in esteem are small haddocks cut in pieces sand worms muscles and limpets and lastly when none of these can be found they use bullocks liver the hooks used there are much smaller than those employed at iceland and newfoundland experience has shown that the larger fish will take a living small one upon the hook sooner than any bait that can be put on therefore they use such as the fish can swallow the hooks are two inches and an half long in the shank and near an inch wide between the shank and the point the line is made of small cording and is always tanned before it is used all the rays and turbots are extremely delicate in their choice of baits if a piece of herring or haddock has been twelve hours out of the sea and then used as a bait they will not touch it    such is the manner of fishing for those fish that usually keep near the bottom on the coasts of england and duhamel observes that the best weather for succeeding is a half calm when the waves are just curled with a silent breeze  but this extent of line which runs as we have seen three miles along the bottom is nothing to what the italians throw out in the mediterranean their fishing is carried on in a tartan which is a vessel much larger than ours and they bait a line of no less than twenty miles long with above ten or twelve thousand hooks this line is called the parasina and the fishing goes by that of the pielago this line is not regularly drawn every six hours as with us but remains for some time in the sea and it requires the space of twentyfour hours to take it up in by this apparatus they take rays sharks and other fish some of which are above a thousand pound weight when they have caught any of this magnitude they strike them through with an harpoon to bring them on board and kill them as fast as they can  this method of catching fish is obviously fatiguing and dangerous but the value of the capture generally repays the pain the skate and the thornback are very good food and their size which is from ten pounds to two hundred weight very well rewards the trouble of fishing for them but it sometimes happens that the lines are visited by very unwelcome intruders by the rough ray the fireflare or the torpedo to all these the fishermen have the most mortal antipathy and when discovered shudder at the sight however they are not always so much upon their guard but that they sometimes feel the different resentments of this angry tribe and instead of a prize find they have caught a vindictive enemy when such is the case they take care to throw them back into the sea with the swiftest expedition  the rough ray inflicts but slight wounds with the prickles with which its whole body is furnished to the ignorant it seems harmless and a man would at first sight venture to take it in his hand without any apprehensions but he soon finds that there is not a single part of its body that is not armed with spines and that there is no way of seizing the animal but by the little fin at the end of the tail  but this animal is harmless when compared to the fireflare which seems to be the dread of even the boldest and most experienced fishermen the weapon with which nature has armed this animal which grows from the tail and which we described as barbed and five inches long has been an instrument of terror to the ancient fishermen as well as the moderns and they have delivered many tremendous fables of its astonishing effects pliny aelian and oppian have supplied it with a venom that affects even the inanimate creation trees that are struck by it instantly lose their verdure and rocks themselves are incapable of resisting the potent poison the enchantress circe armed her son with a spear headed with the spine of the trygon as the most irresistible weapon she could furnish him with a weapon that soon after was to be the death of his own father  that spears and darts says mr penant might in very early times have been headed with this bone instead of iron we have no doubt the americans head their arrows with the bones of fishes to this day and from their hardness and sharpness they are no contemptible weapons but that this spine is possessed of those venomous qualities ascribed to it we have every reason to doubt though some men of high reputation and the whole body of fishermen contend for its venomous effects it is in fact a weapon of offense belonging to this animal and capable from its barbs of inflicting a very terrible wound attended with dangerous symptoms but it cannot be possessed of any poison as the spine has no sheath to preserve the supposed venom on its surface and the animal has no gland that separates the noxious fluid besides all those animals that are furnished with envenomed fangs or stings seem to have them strongly connected with their safety and existence they never part with them there is an apparatus of poison prepared in the body to accompany their exertions and when the fangs or stings are taken away the animal languishes and dies but it is otherwise with the spine of the fireflare it is fixed to the tail as a quill is into the tail of a fowl and is annually shed in the same manner it may be necessary for the creatures defense but is no way necessary for its existence the wound inflicted by an animals tail has something terrible in the idea and may from thence alone be supposed to be fatal from hence terror might have added poison to the pain and called up imagined dangers the negroes universally believe that the sting is poisonous but they never die of the wound for by opening the fish and laying it to the part injured it effects a speedy cure the slightness of the remedy proves the innocence of the wound  the torpedo is an animal of this kind equally formidable and well known with the former but the manner of its operating is to this hour a mystery to mankind the body of this fish is almost circular and thicker than others of the ray kind the skin is soft smooth and of a yellowish color marked as all the kind with large annular spots the eyes very small the tail tapering to a point and the weight of the fish from a quarter to fifteen pounds redi found one twentyfour pounds weight to all outward appearance it is furnished with no extraordinary powers it has no muscles formed for particularly great exertions no internal conformation perceptibly differing from he rest of its kind yet such is that unaccountable power it possesses that the instant it is touched it numbs not only the hand and arm but sometimes also the whole body the shock received by all accounts most resembles the stroke of an electrical machine sudden tingling and painful the instant says kempfer i touched it with my hand i felt a terrible numbness in my arm and as far up as the shoulder even if one treads upon it with the shoe on it affects not only the leg but the whole thigh upwards those who touch it with the foot are seized with a stronger palpitation than even those who touched it with the hand this numbness bears no resemblance to that which we feel when a nerve is a long time pressed and the foot is said to be asleep it rather appears like a sudden vapor which passing through the pores in an instant penetrates to the very springs of life from whence it diffuses itself over the whole body and gives real pain the nerves are so affected that the person struck imagines all the bones of his body and particularly those of the limb that received the blow are driven out of joint all this is accompanied with an universal tremor a sickness of the stomach a general convulsion and a total suspension of the faculties of the mind in short continues kempfer such is the pain that all the force of our promises and authority could not prevail upon a sea man to undergo the shock a second time a negroe indeed that was standing by readily undertook to touch the torpedo and was seen to handle it without feeling any of its effects he informed us that his whole secret consisted in keeping in his breath and we found upon trial that this method answered with ourselves when we held in our breath the torpedo was harmless but when we breathed ever so little its efficacy took place  kempfer has very well described the effects of this animals shock but succeeding experience has abundantly convinced us that holding in the breath no way guards against its violence those therefore who depending on that receipt should play with a torpedo would soon find themselves painfully undeceived not but that this fish may be many times touched with perfect security for it is not upon every occasion that it exerts its potency reaumur who made several trials upon this animal has at least convinced the world that it is not necessarily but by an effort that the torpedo numbs the hand of him that touches it he tried several times and could easily tell when the fish intended the stroke and when it was about to continue harmless always before the fish intended the stroke it flattened the back raised the head and the tail and then by a violent contraction in the opposite direction struck with its back against the pressing finger and the body which before was flat became humped and round  but we must not infer as he has done that the whole effect of this animals exertions arise from the greatness of the blow which the fingers receive at the instant they are struck we will with him allow that the stroke is very powerful equal to that of a musquetball since he will have it so but it is very well known that a blow though never so great on the points of the fingers diffuses no numbness over the whole body such a blow might break the ends of the fingers indeed but would hardly numb the shoulder those blows that numb must be applied immediately to some great and leading nerves or to a large surface of the body a powerful stroke applied to the points of the fingers will be excessively painful indeed but the numbness will not reach beyond the fingers themselves we must therefore look for another cause producing the powerful effects wrought by the torpedo  others have ascribed it to a tremulous motion which this animal is found to possess somewhat resembling that of an horses skin when stung by a fly this operating under the touch with an amazing quickness of vibration they suppose produces the uneasy sensation described above something similar to what we feel when we rub plush cloth against the grain but the cause is quite disproportioned to the effect and so much beyond our experience that this solution is as difficult as the wonder we want to explain  the most probable solution seems to be that the shock proceeds from an animal electricity which this fish has some hidden power of storing up and producing on its most urgent occasions the shocks are entirely similar the duration of the pain is the same but how the animal contrives to renew the charge how it is prevented from evaporating it on contiguous objects how it is originally procured these are difficulties that time alone can elucidate  but to know even the effects is wisdom certain it is that the powers of this animal seem to decline with its vigor for as its strength ceases the force of the shock seems to diminish till at last when the fish is dead the whole power is destroyed and it may be handled or eaten with perfect security on the contrary when immediately taken out of the sea its force is very great and not only affects the hand but if even touched with a stick the person finds himself sometimes affected this power however is not to be extended to the degree that some would have us believe as reaching the fishermen at the end of the line or numbing fishes in the same pond godignus in his history of abyssinia carries this quality to a most ridiculous excess he tells us of one of these that was put into a basket among a number of dead fishes and that the next morning the people to their utter astonishment perceived that the torpedo had actually numbed the dead fishes into life again  to conclude it is generally supposed that the female torpedo is much more powerful than the male lorenzini who has made several experiments upon this animal seems convinced that its power wholly resides in two thin muscles that cover a part of the back these he calls the trembling fibers and he asserts that the animal may be touched with safety in any other part it is now known also that there are more fish than this of the ray kind possessed of the numbing quality which has acquired them the name of the torpedo these are described by atkins and moore and found in great abundance along the coast of africa they are shaped like a mackarel except that the head is much larger the effects of these seem also to differ in some respects moore talks of keeping his hand upon the animal which in the ray torpedo it is actually impossible to do there was no man in the company says he that could bear to keep his hand on this animal the twentieth part of a minute it gave him so great pain but upon taking the hand away the numbness went off and all was well again this numbing quality continued in this torpedo even after it was dead and the very skin was still possessed of its extraordinary power till it became dry condamime informs us of a fish possessed of the powers of the torpedo of a shape very different from the former and every way resembling a lamprey this animal if touched by the hand or even with a stick instantly benumbs the hand and arm to the very shoulder and sometimes the man falls down under the blow these animals therefore must affect the nervous system in a different manner from the former both with respect to the manner and the intention but how this effect is wrought we must be content to dismiss in obscurity  chap iv of the lamprey and its affinities there is a species of the lamprey served up as a great delicacy among the modern romans very different from ours whether theirs be the murena of the ancients i will not pretend to say but there is nothing more certain than that our lamprey is not the roman lamprey agrees with the ancient fish in being kept in ponds and considered by the luxurious as a very great delicacy  the lamprey known among us is differently estimated according to the season in which it is caught or the place where it has been fed those that leave the sea to deposit their spawn in fresh waters are the best those that are entirely bred in our rivers and that have never been at sea are considered as much inferior to the former those that are taken in the months of march april or may just upon their leaving the sea are reckoned very good those that are caught after they have cast their spawn are found to be flabby and of little value those caught in several of the rivers in ireland the people will not venture to touch those of the english severn are considered as the most delicate of all other fish whatever  the lamprey much resembles an eel in its general appearance but is of a lighter color and rather a clumsier make it differs however in the mouth which is round and placed rather obliquely below the end of the nose it more resembles the mouth of a leech than an eel and the animal has a hole on the top of the head through which it spouts water as in the cetaceous kind there are seven holes on each side for respiration and the sins are formed rather by a lengthening out of the skin than any set of bones or spines for that purpose as the mouth is formed resembling that of a leech so it has a property resembling that animal of sticking close to and sucking any body it is applied to it is extraordinary the power they have of adhering to stones which they do so firmly as not to be drawn off without some difficulty we are told of one that weighed but three pound and yet it stuck so firmly to a stone of twelve pounds that it remained suspended at its mouth from which it was separated with no small difficulty this amazing power of suction is supposed to arise from the animals exhausting the air within its body by the hole over the nose while the mouth is closely fixed to the object and permits no air to enter it would be easy to determine the weight this animal is thus able to sustain which will be equal to the weight of a column of air of equal diameter with the fishs mouth  from some peculiarity of formation this animal swims generally with its body as near as possible to the surface and it might easily be drowned by being kept by force for any time under water muralto has given us the anatomy of this animal but in a very minute description makes no mention of lungs yet i am very apt to suspect that two red glands tissued with nerves which he describes as lying toward the back of the head are no other than the lungs of this animal the absolute necessity it is under of breathing in the air convinces me that it must have lungs though i do not know of any anatomist that has described them  the adhesive quality in the lamprey may be in some measure increased by that slimy substance with which its body is all over smeared a substance that serves at once to keep it warm in its cold element and also to keep its skin soft and pliant this mucous is separated by two long lymphatic canals that extend on each side from the head to the tail and that furnish it in great abundance as to its intestines it seems to have but one great bowel running from the mouth to the vent narrow at both ends and wide in the middle  so simple a conformation seems to imply an equal simplicity of appetite in fact the lampreys food is either slime and water or such small waterinsects as are scarce perceivable perhaps its appetite may be more active at sea of which it is properly a native but when it comes up into our rivers it is hardly perceived to devour any thing  its usual time of leaving the sea which it is annually seen to do in order to spawn is about the beginning of spring and after a stay of a few months it returns again to the sea their preparation for spawning is peculiar their manner is to make holes in the gravelly bottom of rivers and on this occasion their sucking power is particularly serviceable for if they meet with a stone of a considerable size they will remove it and throw it out their young are produced from eggs in the manner of flat fish the female remains near the place where they are excluded and continues with them till they come forth she is sometimes seen with her whole family playing about her and after some time she conducts them in triumph back to the ocean  but some have not sufficient strength to return and these continue in the fresh water till they die indeed the life of this fish according to rondeletius who has given its history is but of very short continuance and a single brood is the extent of the females fertility as soon as she has returned after casting her eggs she seems exhausted and flabby she becomes old before her time and two years is generally the limit of her existence  however this may be they are very indifferent eating after they have cast their eggs and particularly at the approach of hot weather the best season for them is the months of march april and may and they are usually taken in nets with salmon and sometimes in baskets at the bottom of the river it has been an old custom for the city of gloucester annually to present the king with a lampreypye and as the gift is made at christmas it is not without great difficulty the corporation can procure the proper quantity though they give a guinea a piece for taking them  how much they were valued among the ancients or a fish bearing some resemblance to them appears from all the classics that have praised good living or ridiculed gluttony one story we are told of this fish with which i will conclude its history a senator of rome whose name does not deserve being transmitted to posterity was famous for the delicacy of his lampreys tigelinus manucius and all the celebrated epicures of rome were loud in his praises no mans fish had such a flavor was so nicely fed or so exactly pickled augustus hearing so much of this mans entertainments desired to be his guest and soon found that fame had been just to his merits the man had indeed very fine lampreys and of an exquisite flavor the emperor was desirous of knowing the method by which he fed his fish to so fine a relish and the glutton making no secret of his art informed him that his way was to throw into his ponds such of his slaves as had at any time displeased him augustus we are told was not much pleased with his receipt and instantly ordered all his ponds to be filled up the story would have ended better if he had ordered the owner to be flung in also  chap viii the sturgeon and its varieties depiction of the sturgeon and the mystus type of catfish the sturgeon the mystus  elias martin sculp   the sturgeon with a form as terrible and a body as large as the shark is yet as harmless as the fish we have been just describing incapable and unwilling to injure others it flies from the smallest fishes and generally falls a victim to its own timidity  the sturgeon in its general form resembles a fresh water pike the nose is long the mouth is situated beneath being small and without jawbones or teeth but though it is so harmless and ill provided for war the body is formidable enough to appearance it is long pentagonal and covered with five rows of large bony knobs one row on the back and two on each side and a number of fins to give it greater expedition of this fish there are three kinds the common sturgeon the caviar sturgeon and the huso or isinglass fish the first has eleven knobs or scales on the back the second has fifteen and the latter thirteen on the back and fortythree on the tail these differences seem slight to us who only consider the animals form but those who consider its uses find the distinction of considerable importance the first is the sturgeon the flesh of which is sent pickled into all parts of europe the second is the fish from the roe of which that noted delicacy called caviar is made and the third besides supplying the caviar furnishes also the valuable commodity of isinglass they all grow to a very great size and some of them have been found above eighteen feet long  there is not a country in europe but what this fish visits at different seasons it annually ascends the largest rivers to spawn and propagates in an amazing number the inhabitants along the banks of the po the danube and the walga make great profit yearly of its incursions up the stream and have their nets prepared for its reception the sturgeon also is brought daily to the markets of rome and venice and they are known to abound in the mediterranean sea yet those fish that keep entirely either in salt or fresh water are but comparatively small when the sturgeon enjoys the vicissitude of fresh and salt water it is then that it grows to an enormous size so as almost to rival even the whale in magnitude  nor are we without frequent visits from this much esteemed fish in england it is often accidentally taken in our rivers in salmonnets particularly in those parts that are not far remote from the sea the largest we have heard of caught in great britain was a fish taken in the eske where they are most frequently found which weighed four hundred and sixty pounds an enormous size to those who have only seen our fresh water fishes  north america also furnishes the sturgeon their rivers in may june and july supply them in very great abundance at that time they are seen sporting in the water and leaping from its surface several yards into the air when they fall again on their sides the concussion is so violent that the noise is heard in still weather at some miles distance  but of all places where this animal is to be found it appears no where in such numbers as in the lakes of frischehaff and curischaff near the city of pillau in the rivers also that empty themselves into the euxine sea this fish is caught in great numbers particularly at the mouth of the river don in all these places the fishermen regularly expect their arrival from the sea and have their nets and salt ready prepared for their reception  as the sturgeon is an harmless fish and no way voracious it is never caught by a bait in the ordinary manner of fishing but always in nets from the description given above of its mouth it is not to be supposed that the sturgeon would swallow any hook capable of holding so large a bulk and so strong a swimmer in fact it never attempts to seize any of the finny tribe but lives by rooting at the bottom of the sea where it makes insects and seaplants its whole subsistence from this quality of floundering at the bottom it has received its name which comes from the german verb stoeren signifying to wallow in the mud that it lives upon no large animals is obvious to all those who cut it open where nothing is found in its stomach but a kind of slimy substance which has induced some to think it lives only upon water and air from hence there is a german proverb which is applied to a man extremely temperate when they say he is as moderate as a sturgeon  as the sturgeon is so temperate in its appetites so is it also equally timid in its nature there would be scarce any method of taking it did not its natural desire of propagation induce it to incur so great a variety of dangers the smallest fish is alone sufficient to terrify a shoal of sturgeons for being unfurnished with any weapon of defense they are obliged to trust to their swiftness and their caution for security like all animals that do not make war upon others sturgeons live in society among themselves rather for the purposes of pleasure than from any power of mutual protection gesner even asserts that they are delighted with sounds of various kinds and that he has seen them shoal together at the notes of a trumpet  the usual time as was said before for the sturgeon to come up rivers to deposit its spawn is about the beginning of summer when the fishermen of all great rivers make a regular preparation for its reception at pillau particularly the shores are formed into districts and allotted to companies of fishermen some of which are rented for about three hundred pounds a year the nets in which the sturgeon are caught are made of small cord and placed across the mouth of the river but in such a manner that whether the tide ebbs or flows the pouch of the net goes with the stream the sturgeon thus caught while in the water is one of the strongest fishes that swims and often breaks the net to pieces that encloses it but the instant it is raised with its head above water all its activity ceases it is then a lifeless spiritless lump and fuffers itself to be tamely dragged on shore it has been found prudent however to draw it to shore gently for if excited by any unnecessary violence it has been found to break the fishermens legs with a blow of its tail the most experienced fishers therefore when they have drawn it to the brink keep the head still elevated which prevents its doing any mischief with the hinder part of the body others by a nooze fasten the head and the tail together and thus without immediately dispatching it bring it to the market if there be one near or keep it till their number is completed for exportation  the flesh of this animal pickled is very well known at all the tables of europe and is even more prized in england than in any of the countries where it is usually caught the fishermen have two different methods of preparing it the one is by cutting it in long pieces lengthwise and having salted them by hanging them up in the sun to dry the fish thus prepared is sold in all the countries of the levant and supplies the want of better provision the other method which is usually practiced in holland and along the shores of the baltic is to cut the sturgeon crosswise into short pieces and put it into small barrels with a pickle made of salt and saumure this is the sturgeon which is sold in england and of which great quantities came from the north until we gave encouragement to the importation of it from north america from thence we are very well supplied but it is said not with such good fish as those imported from the north of europe  a very great trade is also carried on with the roe of the sturgeon preserved in a particular manner and called caviar it is made from the roe of all kinds of sturgeon but particularly the second this is much more in request in other countries of europe than with us to all these high relished meats the appetite must be formed by degrees and though formerly even in england it was very much in request at the politest tables it is at present sunk entirely into difuse it is still however a considerable merchandise among the turks greeks and venetians caviar somewhat resembles soft soap in consistence but it is of a brown uniform color and is eaten as cheese with bread the manner of making it is this they take the spawn from the body of the sturgeon  for it is to be observed that the sturgeon differs from other cartilaginous fish in that it has spawn like a cod and not eggs like a ray  they take the spawn i say and freeing it from the small membranes that connect it together they wash it with vinegar and afterward spread it to dry upon a table they then put it into a vessel with salt breaking the spawn with their hands and not with a pestle this done they put it into a canvas bag letting the liquor drain from it lastly they put it in a tub with holes in the bottom so that if there be any moisture still remaining it may run out then it is pressed down and covered up close for use  but the huso or isinglass fish furnishes a still more valuable commodity this fish is caught in great quantities in the danube from the months of october to january it is seldom under fifty pounds weight and often above four hundred its flesh is soft glutinous and flabby but it is sometimes salted which makes it better tasted and then it turns red like salmon it is for the commodity it furnishes that it is chiefly taken isinglass is of a whitish substance enclining to yellow done up into rolls and so exported for use it is very well known as serviceable not only in medicine but many arts the varnisher the winemerchant and even the clothier know its uses and very great sums are yearly expended upon this single article of commerce the manner of making it is this they take the skin the entrails the fins and the tail of this fish and cut them into small pieces these are left to macerate in a sufficient quantity of warm water and they are all boiled shortly after with a slow fire until they are dissolved and reduced to a jelly this jelly is spread upon instruments made for the purpose so that drying it assumes the form of parchment and when quite dry it is then rolled into the form which we see it in the shops  this valuable commodity is principally furnished from russia where they prepare great quantities surprizingly cheap mr jackson an ingenious countryman of our own found out an obvious method of making a glue at home that answered all the purposes of isinglass but what with the trouble of making it and perhaps the arts put in practice to undersell him he was as i am told obliged to discontinue the improvement of his discovery indeed it is a vain attempt to manufacture among ourselves those things which may be more naturally and cheaply supplied elsewhere we have many traders that are unnaturally if i may so express it employed among us who furnish more laboriously those necessaries with which other countries could easily and cheaply supply us it would be wiser to take what they can thus produce and to turn our artizans to the increase and manufacture of such productions as thrive more readily among us were for instance the number of hands that we have now employed in the manufacture of silk turned to the increase of agriculture it is probable that the increased quantity of corn thus produced would be more than an equivalent for the diminution of national wealth in purchasing wrought silk from other countries  chap ix of anomalous cartilaginous fishes depiction of the frog fish and the sun fish   the frog fish   the sun fish  e martin sc    of all others the cartilaginous class seems to abound with the greatest variety of illformed animals and if philosophy could allow the expression we might say that the cartilaginous class was the class of monsters in fact it exhibits a variety of shapeless beings the deviations of which from the usual form of fishes are beyond the power of words to describe and scarcely of the pencil to draw in this class we have the pipe fish that almost tapers to a thread and the sun fish that has the appearance of a bulky head but the body cut off in the middle the hippocampus with an head somewhat like that of an horse and the water bat whose head can scarcely be distinguished from the body in this class we find the fishing frog which from its deformity some have called the sea devil the chimaera the lump fish the sea porcupine and the sea snail of all these the history is but little known and naturalists supply the place with description  the sun fish sometimes grows to a very large size one taken near plymouth was five hundred weight in form it resembles a bream or some deep fish cut off in the middle the mouth is very small and contains in each jaw two broad teeth with sharp edges the color of the back is dusky and dappled and the belly is of a silvery white when boiled it has been observed to turn to a glutinous jelly and would most probably serve for all the purposes of isinglass were it found in sufficient plenty  the fishing frog in shape very much resembles a tadpole or young frog but then a tadpole of enormous size for it grows to above five feet long and its mouth is sometimes a yard wide nothing can exceed its deformity the head is much bigger than the whole body the under jaw projects beyond the upper and both are armed with rows of slender sharp teeth the palate and the tongue are furnished with teeth in like manner the eyes are placed on the top of the head and are encompassed with prickles immediately above the nose are two long beards or filaments small in the beginning but thicker at the end and round these as it is said answer a very singular purpose for being made somewhat resembling a fishingline it is asserted that the animal converts them to the purposes of fishing with these extended as pliny asserts the fishing frog hides in muddy waters and leaves nothing but the beards to be seen the curiosity of the smaller fish bring them to view these filaments and their hunger induces them to seize the bait upon which the animal in ambush instantly draws in its filaments with the little fish that had taken the bait and devours it without mercy this story though apparently improbable has found credit among some of our best naturalists but what induces me to doubt the fact is that there is another species of this animal that has no beards which it would not want if they were necessary to the existence of the kind rondeletius informs us that if we take out the bowels the body will appear with a kind of transparence and that if a lighted candle be placed within the body as in a lanthorn the whole has a very formidable appearance the fishermen however have in general a great regard for this ugly fish as it is an enemy to the dog fish the bodies of those fierce and voracious animals being often found in its stomach whenever they take it therefore they always set it at liberty  the lump fish is trifling in size compared to the former its length is but sixteen inches and its weight about four pounds the shape of the body is like that of a bream deep and it swims edgeways the back is sharp and elevated and the belly flat the lips mouth and tongue of this animal are of a deep red the whole skin is rough with bony knobs the largest row is along the ridge of the back the belly is of a bright crimson color but what makes the chief singularity in this fish is an oval aperture in the belly surrounded with a fleshy soft substance that seems bearded all round by means of this part it adheres with vast force to any thing it pleases if flung into a pail of water it will stick so close to the bottom that on taking the fish by the tail one may lift up pail and all though it holds several gallons of water great numbers of these fish are found along the coasts of greenland in the beginning of summer where they resort to spawn their roe is remarkably large and the greenlanders boil it to a pulp for eating they are extremely fat but not admired in england being both flabby and insipid  the sea snail takes its name from the soft and unctuous texture of its body resembling the snail upon land it is almost transparent and soon dissolves and melts away it is but a little animal being not above five inches long the color when fresh taken is of a pale brown the shape of the body round and the back fin reaches all the way from the head to the tail beneath the throat is a round depression of a whitish color surrounded by twelve brown spots placed in a circle it is taken in england at the mouths of rivers four or five miles distant from the sea  the body of the pipe fish in the thickest part is not thicker than a swanquill while it is above sixteen inches long this is angular but the angles being not very sharp they are not discernable until the fish is dried its general color is an olive brown marked with numbers of bluish lines pointing from the back to the belly it is viviparous for on crushing one that was just taken hundreds of very minute young ones were observed to crawl about  the hippocampus which from the form of its head some call the sea horse never exceeds nine inches in length it is about as thick as a mans thumb and the body is said while alive to have hair on the fore part which falls off when it is dead the snout is a sort of a tube with a hole at the bottom to which there is a cover which the animal can open and shut at pleasure behind the eyes there are two fins which look like ears and above them are two holes which serve for respiration the whole body seems to be composed of cartilaginous rings on the intermediate membranes of which several small prickles are placed it is found in the mediterranean and also in the western ocean and upon the whole more resembles a great caterpillar than a fish the ancients considered it as extremely venomous probably induced by its peculiar figure  from these harmless animals covered with a slight coat of mail we may proceed to others more thickly defended and more formidably armed whose exact station in the scale of fishes is not yet ascertained while linnaeus ranks them among the cartilaginous kinds a later naturalist places them among the spinous class with which tribe they most agree succeeding observations must determine at present we seem better acquainted with their figure than their history their deformity is obvious and the venomous nature of the greatest number has been confirmed by fatal experience this circumstance as well as the happy distance at which they are placed from us being all found in the oriental or american seas may have prevented a more critical enquiry so that we know but little of the nature of their malignity and still less of their pursuits and enmities in the deep  in the first of this tribe we may place the depiction of the sea hedghog type of urchin the sea orb porcupine fish and the ostracion type of boxfish the sea hedghog   the sea orb   the ostracion  e martin sculp sea orb which is almost round has a mouth like a frog and is from seven inches to two feet long like the porcupine from whence it sometimes takes its name being also called the sea porcupine it is covered over with long thorns or prickles which point on every side and when the animal is enraged it can blow up its body as round as a bladder of this extraordinary creature there are many kinds some threatening only with spines as the sea hedgehog others defended with a bony helmet that covers the head as the ostracion others with a coat of mail from the head to the tail where it terminates in a point as the centriscus and others still armed offensively and defensively with bones and spines as the shield orb  of these scarce one is without its peculiar weapon of offense the centriscus wounds with its spine the ostracion poisons with its venom the orb is impregnable and is absolutely poisonous if eaten indeed their figure is not such as would tempt one to make the experiment and the natives of those countries where they are sound are careful to inform foreigners of their danger yet a certain sailor at the cape of good hope not believing what the dutch told him concerning their venom was resolved to make the experiment and break through a prejudice which he supposed was founded on the animals deformity he tried and eat one but his rashness cost him his life he instantly fell sick and died a few days after  these frightful animals are of different sizes some not bigger than a football and others as large as a bushel they almost all flatten and erect their spines at pleasure and increase the terrors of their appearance in proportion to the approach of danger at first they seem more inoffensive their body oblong with all their weapons pointing toward the tail but upon being provoked or alarmed the body that before seemed small swells to the view the animal visibly grows rounder and larger and all its prickles stand upright and threaten the invader on every side the americans often amuse themselves with the barren pleasure of catching these frightful creatures by a line and hook baited with a piece of seacrab the animal approaches the bait with its spines flattened but when hooked and stopped by the line straight all its spines are erected the whole body being armed in such a manner at all points that it is impossible to lay hold of it on any part for this reason it is dragged to some distance from the water and there it quickly expires in the middle of the belly of all these there is a sort of bag or bladder filled with air and by the inflation of which the animal swells itself in the manner already mentioned  in describing the deformed animals of this class one is sometimes at a loss whether it be a fish or an insect that lies before him thus the hippocampus and the pipefish bear a strong resemblance to the caterpillar and the worm while the lesser orb bears some likeness to the class of seaeggs to be described after i will conclude this account of cartilaginous fishes with the description of an animal which i would scarcely call a fish but that father labat dignifies it with the name indeed this class teems with such a number of odd shaped animals that one is prompted to rank every thing extraordinary of the finny species among the number but besides labat says its bones are cartilaginous and that may entitle it to a place here  the animal i mean is the galley fish which linnaeus degrades into the insect tribe under the title of the medusa but which i choose to place in this tribe from its habits that are somewhat similar to the eye of an unmindful spectator this fish seems a transparent bubble swimming on the surface of the sea or like a bladder variously and beautifully painted with vivid colors where red and violet predominate as variously opposed to the beams of the sun it is however an actual fish the body of which is composed of cartilages and a very thin skin filled with air which thus keeps the animal floating on the surface as the waves and the winds happen to drive sometimes it is seen thrown on the shore by one wave and again washed back into the sea by another persons who happen to be walking along the shore often happen to tread upon these animals and the bursting of their body yields a report like that when one treads upon the swim of a fish it has eight broad feet with which it swims or which it expands to catch the air as with a sail it fastens itself to whatever it meets by means of its legs which have an adhesive quality whether they move when on shore labat could never perceive though he did every thing to make them stir he only saw that it strongly adhered to whatever substances he applied it it is very common in america and grows to the size of a goose egg or somewhat more it is perpetually seen floating and no efforts that are used to hurt it can sink it to the bottom all that appears above water is a bladder clear and transparent as glass and shining with the most beautiful colors of the rainbow beneath in the water are four of the feet already mentioned that serve as oars while the other four are expanded above to sail with but what is most remarkable in this extraordinary creature is the violent pungency of the slimy substance with which its legs are smeared if the smallest quantity but touch the skin so caustic is its quality that it burns it like hot oil dropped on the part affected the pain is worst in the heat of the day but ceases in the cool of the evening it is from feeding on these that he thinks the poisonous quality contracted by some westindian fish may be accounted for it is certain these animals are extremely common along all the coasts in the gulf of mexico and whenever the shore is covered with them in an unusual manner it is considered as a certain forerunner of a storm  part iii of spinous fishes  former are trifling in comparison and make not above a fifth part of the finny creation  from the great variety in this class it is obvious how difficult a task it must have been to describe or remember even a part of what it contains when six hundred different sorts of animals offer themselves to consideration the mind is bewildered in the multiplicity of objects that all lay some claim to its attention to obviate this confusion systems have been devised which throwing several fishes that agree in many particulars into one groupe and thus uniting all into so many particular bodies the mind that was incapable of separately considering each is enabled to comprehend all when thus offered in larger masses to its consideration  indeed of all the beings in animated nature fishes most demand a systematical arrangement quadrupedes are but few and can be all known birds from their seldom varying in their size can be very tolerably distinguished without system but among fishes which no size can discriminate where the animal ten inches and the animal ten feet long is entirely the same there must be some other criterion by which they are to be distinguished something that gives precision to our ideas of the animal whose history we desire to know  of the real history of fishes very little is yet known but of very many we have full and sufficient accounts as to their external form it would be unpardonable therefore in an history of these animals not to give the little we do know and at least arrange our forces though we cannot tell their destination in this art of arrangement artedi and linnaeus have long been conspicuous they have both taken a view of the animals form in different lights and from the parts which most struck them have founded their respective systems  artedi who was foremost perceiving that some fishes had hard prickly fins as the pike that others had soft pliant ones as the herring and that others still wanted that particular fin by which the gills are opened and shut as the eel made out a system from these varieties linnaeus on the other hand rejecting this system which he found liable to too many exceptions considered the fins not with regard to their substance but their position the ventral fins seem to be the great object of his system he considers them in fishes supplying the same offices as feet in quadrupedes and from their total absence or from their being situated nearer the head or the tail in different fishes he takes the differences of his system  these arrangements which are totally arbitrary and which are rather a method than a science are always fluctuating and the last is generally preferred to that which went before there has lately appeared however a system composed by mr gouan of montpellier that deserves applause for more than its novelty it appears to me the best arrangement of this kind that ever was made and in it the divisions are not only precisely systematical but in some measure adopted by nature itself this learned frenchman has united the systems of artedi and linnaeus together and by bringing one to correct the other has made out a number of tribes that are marked with the utmost precision a part of his system however we have already gone through in the cartilaginous or as he calls a part of them the branchiostegous tribe of fishes in the arrangement of these i have followed linnaeus as the number of them was but small and his method simple but in that which is more properly called the spinous class of fishes i will follow mr gouans system the terms of which as well as of all the former systems require some explanation i do not love to multiply the technical terms of a science but it often happens that names by being long used are as necessary to be known as the science itself  if we consider the substance of the fin of a fish we shall find it composed besides the skin either of straight hard pointed bony prickles or spines as in the pike or of soft crooked or forked bones or cartilages as in the herring the fish that have bony prickly fins are called prickly finned fish the latter that have soft or cartilaginous fins are called soft finned fish the prickly finned fish have received the greek newformed name of acanthopterigii the soft finned fish have likewise their barbarous greek name of malacopterigii thus far artedi has supplied mr gouan with names and divisions all spinous fish are divided into prickly finned fish and soft finned fish  again linnaeus has taught him to remark the situation of the fins for the ventral or belly fins which are those particularly to be remarked are either wholly wanting as in the eel and then the fish is called apodal a greek word signifying without feet or the ventral fins are placed more forward than the pectoral fins as in the haddock and then the animal is called a jugular fish or the ventral fins are placed directly under the pectoral fins as in the fatherlasher and then it is called a thoracic fish or lastly the ventral fins are placed nearer the tail than the pectoral fins as in the minow and then it is an abdominal fish  possessed of these distributions the french naturalist mixes and unites them into two grand divisions all the prickly finned fish make one general division all the soft finned fish another these first are distinguished from each other as being either apodal jugular thoracic or abdominal thus there are prickly finned apodal fishes prickly finned jugular fishes prickly finned thoracic fishes and prickly finned abdominal fishes on the other hand the soft finned fishes fall under a similar distribution and make the other general division thus there are soft finned apodal fishes soft finned jugular fishes soft finned thoracic fishes and soft finned abdominal fishes these general characters are strongly marked and easily remembered it only remains therefore to divide these into such tribes as are most strongly marked by nature and to give the distinct characters of each to form a complete system with great simplicity this mr gouan has done and the tribes into which he has distributed each of these divisions exactly amount to fifty thus the reader who can contain in his memory the characteristic marks of fifty kinds will have a tolerable idea of the form of every kind of spinous fish i say of the form for as to the history and the nature of the animal itself that can only be obtained by experience and information  prickly finned

which any fish that offers we can know its rank its affinities and partly its anatomy all which make a considerable part in its natural history but to show the use of this system still more apparently suppose i meet with a fish the name to me unknown of which i desire to know something more the way is first to see whether it be a cartilaginous fish which may be known by its wanting fins to open and shut the gills which the cartilaginous kinds are wholly without if i find that it has them then it is a spinous fish and in order to know its kind i examine its fins whether they be prickly or soft i find them soft it is therefore to be ranked among the soft finned fishes i then examine its ventral or belly fins and finding that the fish has them i look for their situation and find they lie nearer to the tail than the pectoral fins by this i find the animal to be a soft finned abdominal fish then to know which of the kinds of these fishes it is i examine its figure and the shape of its head i find the body rather oblong the head with a small beak the lower jaw like a saw the fin covering the gills with eight rays this animal must therefore be the herring or one of that family such as the pilchard the sprat the shad or the anchovy to give another instance upon examining the fins of a fish to me unknown i find them prickly i then lok for the situation of the ventral fins i find them entirely wanting this then must be a prickly finned apodal fish of this kind there are but three and by comparing the fish with the description i find it either of the trichurus kind the swordfish or the gilt head upon examining also its internal structure i shall find a very great similitude between my fish and that placed at the head of the family  chap ii of spinous fishes in general having given a method by which spinous fishes may be distinguished from each other the history of each in particular might naturally be expected to follow but such a distinct account of each would be very disgusting from the unavoidable uniformity of every description the history of any one of this class very much resembles that of all the rest they breathe air and water through the gills they live by rapine each devouring such animals as its mouth is capable of admitting and they propagate not by bringing forth their young alive as in the cetaceous tribes nor by distinct eggs as in the generality of the cartilaginous tribes but by spawn or peace as they are generally called which they produce by hundreds of thousands these are the leading marks that run through their whole history and which have so much swelled books with tiresome repetition  it will be sufficient therefore to draw this numerous class into one point of view and to mark how they differ from the former classes and what they possess peculiarly striking so as to distinguish them from each other the first object that presents itself and that by which they differ from all others are the bones these when examined but slightly appear to be entirely solid yet when viewed more closely every bone will be found hollow and filled with a substance less rancid and oily than marrow these bones are very numerous and pointed and as in quadrupedes are the props or stays to which the muscles are fixed which move the different parts of the body  the number of bones in all spinous fishes of the same kind is always the same it is a vulgar way of speaking to say that fishes are at some seasons more bony than at others but this scarce requires contradiction it is true indeed that fish are at some seasons much fatter than at others so that the quantity of the flesh being diminished and that of the bones remaining the same they appear to increase in number as they actually bear a greater proportion  all fish of the same kind as was said have the same number of bones the skeleton of a fish however irregularly the bones may fall in our way at table has its members very regularly disposed and every bone has its fixed place with as much precision as we find in the orders of a regular fabric but then spinous fish differ in the number of bones according to the species for some have a greater number of fins by which they move in the water the number in each is always in proportion to the number and size of these fins for every fish has a regular apparatus of bones and muscles by which the fins are moved and all those fish where they are numerous or large must of consequence be considerably bony indeed in the larger fish the quantity of flesh is so much and the bones themselves are so large that they are easily seen and separated but in the smaller kinds with many fins the bones are as numerous as in the great yet being so very minute they lurk almost in every part of the flesh and are dangerous as well as troublesome to be eaten in a word those fish which are large fat and have few fins are found to be the least bony those which are small lean and have many fins are the most bony of all others thus for instance a roach appears more bony than a carp because it is leaner and smaller and it is actually more bony than an eel because it has a greater number of fins  as the spinous fish partake less of the quadrupede in their formation than any others so they can bear to live out of their own element a shorter time in general when taken out of the water they testify their change by panting more violently and at closer intervals the thin air not furnishing their gills the proper play and in a few minutes they expire some indeed are more vivacious in air than others the eel will live several hours out of water and the carp has been known to be fattened in a damp cellar the method is by placing it in a net well wrapped up in wet moss the mouth only out and then hung up in a vault the fish is fed with white bread and milk and the net now and then plunged into the water the animal thus managed has been known not only to live for a fortnight but to grow exceedingly fat and of a superior flavor from this it would seem that the want of moisture in the gills is the chief cause of the death of these animals and could that be supplied their lives might be prolonged in the air almost as well as in their own element  yet it is impossible to account for the different operations of the same element upon animals that to appearance have the same conformation to some fishes bred in the sea fresh water is immediate destruction on the other hand some fishes that live in our lakes and ponds cannot bear the salt water whence this difference can arise is not easy to be accounted for the saline quality of the water cannot properly be given as the cause since no fishes imbibe any of the seas saltness with their food or in respiration the flesh of all fishes is equally fresh both in the river and at the saltest depths of the ocean the salt of the element in which they live no way mixing with their constitution whence then is it that animals will live only there and will quickly expire when carried into fresh water it may probably arise from the superior weight of the seawater as from the great quantity of salt dissolved in its composition it is much heavier than fresh water so it is probable it lies with greater force upon the organs of respiration and gives them their proper and necessary play on the other hand those fish which are used only to fresh water cannot bear the weight of the saline fluid and expire in a manner suffocated in the grossness of the strange element  but though there are some tribes that live only in the sea and others only in fresh water yet there are some whose organs are equally adapted to either element and that spend a part of their season in one and a part in the other thus the salmon the shad the smelt and the flounder annually quit their native ocean and come up our rivers to deposite their spawn this seems the most important business of their lives and there is no danger which they will not encounter even to the surmounting precipices to find a proper place for the deposition of their future offspring the salmon upon these occasions is seen to ascend rivers five hundred miles from the sea and to brave not only the danger of various enemies but also to spring up cataracts as high as a house as soon as they come to the bottom of the torrent they seem disappointed to meet the obstruction and swim some paces back they then take a view of the danger that lies before them survey it motionless for some minutes advance and again retreat till at last summoning up all their force they take a leap from the bottom their body straight and strongly in motion and thus most frequently clear every obstruction it sometimes happens however that they want strength to make the leap and then in our fisheries they are taken in their descent but this is one of the smallest dangers that attend these adventuring animals in their progress numberless are the methods of taking them as well by the hook as by nets baskets and other inventions which it is not our business here to describe their capture makes in several countries a great article of commerce and being cured in several different depiction of the sword fish the sturgeon and the salmon   the sword fish   the sturgeon   a salmon  e martin sculp manners either by salting pickling or drying they are sent to all the markets of europe  as these mount up the rivers to deposite their spawn others particularly the eel descend the fresh water stream as redi assures us to bring forth their young in the sea about the month of august annually these animals take the opportunity of the most obscure nights and when the rivers are flooded by accidental rains seek the ocean when they have reached the sea and produced their young for they are viviparous they again ascend the stream at different times as opportunity offers or as the season is favorable or tempestuous their passage begins usually about the end of january and continues till toward the end of may when they are taken in the river arno by millions and so small that a thousand of them goes to a pound there is nothing more certain than that they descend in our own rivers after floods in great abundance and are thus caught in nets to very great advantage they are possessed also of a power of climbing over any obstacle for by applying their glutinous and slimy bodies to the surface of the object they desire to surmount they can thus creep up locks weirs and every thing that would prevent their ascending the current of the stream  but the length of the voyage performed by these fishes is sport if compared to what is annually undertaken by some tribes that constantly reside in the ocean these are known to take a course of three or four thousand miles in a season serving for prey to whales sharks and the numerous flocks of waterfowl that regularly wait to intercept their progress these may be called fish of passage and bear a strong analogy to birds of passage both from their social disposition and the immensity of their numbers of this kind are the cod the haddock the whiting the mackrel the tunny the herring and the pilchard other fish live in our vicinity and reside on our coasts all the year round or keep in the depths of the ocean and are but seldom seen but these at stated seasons visit their accustomed haunts with regular certainty generally returning the same week in the succeeding year and often the same day  the stated returns and the regular progress of these fish of passage is one of the most extraordinary circumstances in all the history of nature what it is that impels them to such distant voyages what directs their passage what supports them by the way and what sometimes prompts them to quit for several seasons one shore for another and then return depiction of the saw fish the cod fish and the tunny   the saw fish   the cod fish   the tunny  e martin sculp to their accustomed harbor are questions that curiosity may ask but philosophy can hardly resolve we must dismiss enquiry satisfied with the certainty of the facts  the cod seems to be the foremost of this wandering tribe and is only found in our northern part of the world this animals chief place of resort is on the banks of newfoundland and the other sand banks that lie off capebreton that extensive flat seems to be no other than the broad top of a seamountain extending for above five hundred miles long and surrounded with a deeper sea hither the cod annually repair in numbers beyond the power of calculation to feed on the quantity of worms that are to be found there in the sandy bottom here they are taken in such quantities that they supply all europe with a considerable share of provision the english have stages erected all along the shore for salting and drying them and the fishermen who take them with the hook and line which is their method draw them in as fast as they can throw out this immense capture however makes but a very small diminution when compared to their numbers and when their provision there is exhausted or the season for propagation returns they go off to the polar seas where they deposite their roes in full security from thence want of food forces them as soon as the first more southern seas are open to repair southward for subsistence nor is this fish an unfrequent visitant upon our own shores but the returns are not so regular nor does the capture bear any proportion to that at newfoundland  the haddock the whiting and the mackrel are thought by some to be driven upon our coasts rather by their fears than their appetites and it is to the pursuit of larger fishes we owe their welcome visits it is much more probable that they come for that food which is found in more plenty near the shore than farther out at sea one thing is remarkable that their migrations seem to be regularly conducted the grand shoal of haddocks that comes periodically on the yorkshire coasts appeared there in a body on the tenth of december      and exactly on the same day in the following year this shoal extended from the shore near three miles in breadth and in length for more than forty the limits of a shoal are precisely known for if the fishermen put down their lines at the distance of more than three miles from shore they catch nothing but dog fish a proof that the haddock is not there  but of all migrating fish the herring and the pilchard take the most adventurous voyages herrings are found in the greatest abundance in the highest northern latitudes in those inaccessible seas that are covered with ice for a great part of the year the herring and pilchard find a quiet and sure retreat from all their numerous enemies thither neither man nor their still more destructive enemy the fin fish or the cachalot dares to pursue them the quantity of insect food which those seas supply is very great whence in that remote situation defended by the icy rigor of the climate they live at ease and multiply beyond expression from this most desirable retreat anderson supposes they would never depart but that their numbers render it necessary for them to migrate and as with bees from a hive they are compelled to seek for other retreats  for this reason the great colony is seen to set out from the icy sea about the middle of winter composed of numbers that if all the men in the world were to be loaded with herrings they would not carry the thousandth part away but they no sooner leave their retreats but millions of enemies appear to thin their squadrons the finfish and the cachalot swallow barrels at a yawn the porpus the grampus the shark and the whole numerous tribe of dogfish find them an easy prey and desist from making war upon each other but still more the unnumbered flocks of seafowl that chiefly inhabit near the pole watch the outset of their dangerous migration and spread extensive ruin  in this exigence the defenseless emigrants find no other safety but by crouding closer together and leaving to the outmost bands the danger of being the first devoured thus like sheep when frighted that always run together in a body and each finding some protection in being but one of many that are equally liable to invasion they are seen to separate into shoals one body of which moves to the west and pours down along the coasts of america as far south as carolina and but seldom farther in chesepeak bay the annual inundation of these fish is so great that they cover the shores in such quantites as to become a nuisance those that hold more to the east and come down toward europe endeavor to save themselves from their merciless pursuers by approaching the first shore they can find and that which first offers in their descent is the coast of iceland in the beginning of march upon their arrival on that coast their phalanx which has already suffered considerable diminutions is nevertheless of amazing extent depth and closeness covering an extent of shore as large as the island itself the whole water seems alive and is seen so black with them to a great distance that the number seems inexhaustible there the porpess and the shark continue their depredations and the birds devour what quantities they please by these enemies the herrings are cooped up into so close a body that a shovel or any hollow vessel put into the water takes them up without farther trouble  that body which comes upon our coasts begins to appear off the shetland isles in april these are the forerunners of the grand shoal which descends in june while its arrival is easily announced by the number of its greedy attendants the gannet the gull the shark and the porpess when the main body is arrived its breadth and depth is such as to alter the very appearance of the ocean it is divided into distinct columns of five or six miles in length and three or four broad while the water before them curls up as if forced out of its bed sometimes they sink for the space of ten or fifteen minutes then rise again to the surface and in bright weather reflect a variety of splendid colors like a field bespangled with purple gold and azure the fishermen are ready prepared to give them a proper reception and by nets made for the occasion they take sometimes above two thousand barrels at a single draught  from the shetland isles another body of this great army where it divides goes off to the western coasts of ireland where they meet with a second necessity of dividing the one takes to the atlantic where it is soon lost in that extensive ocean the other passes into the irish sea and furnishes a very considerable capture to the natives  in this manner the herrings expelled from their native seas seek those bays and shores where they can find food and the best defense against their unmerciful pursuers of the deep in general the most inhabited shores are the places where the larger animals of the deep are least fond of pursuing and these are chosen by the herring as an asylum from greater dangers thus along the coasts of norway the german shores and the northern shores of france these animals are found punctual in their visitations in these different places they produce their young which when come to some degree of maturity attend the general motions after the destruction of such numbers the quantity that attempts to return is but small and anderson doubts whether they ever return  such is the account given of the migration of these fishes by one who of all others was best acquainted with their history and yet many doubts arise in every part of the migration the most obvious which has been made is that though such numbers perish in their descent from the north yet in comparison to those that survive the account is trifling and it is supposed that of those taken by man the proportion is not one to a million their regularly leaving the shore also at a stated time would imply that they are not in these visits under the impulse of necessity in fact there seems one circumstance that shows these animals governed by a choice with respect to the shores they pitch upon and not blindly drove from one shore to another what i mean is their fixing upon some shores for several seasons or indeed for several ages together and after having regularly visited them every year then capriciously forsaking them never more to return the first great bank for herrings was along the shores of norway before the year      the number of ships from all parts of europe that resorted to that shore exceeded some thousands the quantity of herrings that were then assembled there was such that a man who should put a spear in the water as olaus magnus asserts would see it stand on end being prevented from falling but soon after that period these animals were seen to desert the norway shores and took up along the german coast where the hansetowns drove a very great trade by their capture and sale but for above a century the herrings have in a great measure forsaken them and their greatest colonies are seen in the british channel and upon the irish shores it is not easy to assign a cause for this seemingly capricious desertion whether the number of their finny enemies increasing along the northern coasts may have terrified the herring tribe from their former places of resort or whether the quantity of food being greater in the british channel may not allure them thither is not easy to determine  the pilchard which is a fish differing little from the herring makes the coast of cornwall its place of principal resort their arrival on that coast is soon proclaimed by their attendants the birds and the larger fishes and the whole country prepare to take the advantage of this treasure providentially thrown before them the natives sometimes enclose a bay of several miles extent with their nets called saines to direct them in their operations there were some years ago but i believe they are discontinued several men placed on eminencies near the shore called huers who with brooms in their hands gave signals where the nets were to be extended and where the shoals of fishes lay this they perceived by the color of the water which assumed a tincture from the shoals beneath by these means they sometimes take twelve or fifteen hundred barrels of pilchards at a draught and they place them in heaps on the shore it often happens that the quantity caught exceeds the salt or the utensils for curing them and then they are carried off to serve for the purposes of manure this fishery employs nor only great numbers of men at sea training them to naval affairs but also numbers of women and children at land in salting and curing the fish in making boats nets ropes and casks for the purposes of taking or fitting them for sale the poor are fed with the superfluity of the capture the land is manured with the offals the merchant finds the gain of commission and honest commerce the fisherman a comfortable subsistence from his toil ships says dr borlase are often freighted hither with salt and into foreign countries with the fish carrying off at the same time a part of our tin the usual produce of the number of hogsheads exported for ten years from      to      inclusive amounted to near thirty thousand hogsheads each year every hogshead has amounted upon an average to the price of one pound thirteen shillings and threepence thus the money paid for pilchards exported has annually amounted to near fifty thousand pounds  whence these infinite numbers are derived still remains obscure but it will increase our wonder to be told that so small a fish as the stickleback which is seldom above two inches long and that one would think could easily find support in any water is yet obliged to colonize and leave its native fens in search of new habitations once every seventh or eighth year amazing shoals of these appear in the river welland near spalding and come up the stream forming one great column they are supposed to be multitudes collected in some of the fens till overcharged with numbers they are periodically obliged to migrate an idea may be had of their numbers when we are informed that a man employed by a farmer to take them for the purpose of manuring his grounds has got for a considerable time four shillings a day by selling them at a halfpenny a bushel  thus we see the amazing propagation of fishes along our own coasts and rivers but their numbers bear no proportion to the vast quantities found among the islands of the indian ocean the inhabitants of these countries are not under the necessity even of providing instruments for fishing it is but going down to the shore and there the fish are found in great numbers in the plashes that still continue to have water in them in some of these places the quantity is so great that they are lest in shoals on those swamps dried up by the sun and their putrefaction contributes to render the country unhealthful  this power of increasing in these animals exceeds our idea as it would in a very short time outstrip all calculation a single herring if suffered to multiply unmolested and undiminished for twenty years would show a progeny greater in bulk than ten such globes as that we live upon but happily the balance of nature is exactly preserved and their consumption is equal to their fecundity for this reason we are to consider the porpess the shark or the codfish not in the light of plunderers and rivals but of benefactors to mankind without their assistance the sea would soon become overcharged with the burden of its own productions and that element which at present distributes health and plenty to the shore would but load it with putrefaction  in the propagation of all fish some degree of warmth seems absolutely necessary not only to their preservation but to the advancement of their posterity their spawn is always deposited in those places where the sunbeams may reach them either at the bottom of shallow shores or floating on the surface in deeper waters a small degree of heat answers all the purposes of incubation and the animal issues from the egg in its state of perfect formation never to undergo any succeeding change  yet still i have some doubts whether most fish come from the egg completely formed we know that in all the frog tribe and many of the lizard kind they are produced from the egg in an imperfect form the tadpole or young frog with its enormous head and slender tail are well known a species of the lizard also which is excluded from the shell without legs only acquires them by degrees and not till after some time does it put off its serpent form it is probable that some kinds of fish in like manner suffer a change and though it be too inconsiderable to strike the fisherman or the inattentive spectator yet it makes a very material difference to the naturalist and would perhaps disarrange his most favorite systems a slight alteration in the fins or bones that cover the gills would overturn the whole fabric of the most applauded ichthyologist and yet as i observed it is most probable that these minute alterations often take place  as a proof of this during the month of july there appear near greenwich innumerable shoals of small fishes which are known to the londoners by the name of white bait it is universally agreed that they are the young of some fish they are never seen but at this time of the year and never found to have any roe a circumstance that proves their not being come to maturity the quantity is amazing and the fish that produces them in such numbers must be in plenty though it is not yet known what that fish is as they correspond with no other species whatever they most resemble the smelt in form and yet they want a fin which that animal is never without they cannot be the bleak as they are never found in other rivers where the bleak breed in great abundance it is most probable therefore that they are the young of some animal not yet come to their perfect form and therefore reducible to no present system  the time that spinous fishes continue in the pea is in proportion to the size of the kind it is a rule that chiefly holds through nature that the larger the animals are the longer they continue before exclusion this i say holds generally through all nature though it is not easy to assign a cause for so well known a truth it may probably be that as all large bodies take a longer time to grow hot than small ones so the larger the egg the longer influence of vital warmth it requires to reach through all its recesses and to unfold the dormant springs that wait to be put into motion  the manner in which the eggs of fishes are impregnated is wholly unknown all that obviously offers is that in ponds the sexes are often seen together among the long grass at the edge of the water that there they seem to struggle and that during this time they are in a state of suffering they grow thin they lose their appetite and their flesh becomes flabby the scales of some grow rough and they lose their luster on the contrary when the time of coupling is over their appetite returns they reassume their natural agility and their scales become brilliant and beautiful  although the usual way with spinous fishes is to produce by spawn yet there are some such as the cel and the blenny that are known to bring forth their young alive bowlker who has written a treatise upon fishing seems to determine the question relative to the viviparous production of eels upon the authority of one or two credible witnesses an eel opened in the presence of several persons of credit was found to have an infinite number of little creatures closely wrapped up together in a lump about the size of a nutmeg which being put into a basin of water soon separated and swam about yet still whether these may not have been worms generated in the animals body remains a doubt for there are scarce any fishes that are not infested with worms in that manner  with respect to the growth of fishes it is observed that among carps particularly the first year they grow to about the size of the leaf of a willowtree at two years they are about four inches long they grow but one inch more the third season which is five inches those of four years old are about six inches and seven after the fifth from that to eight years old they are found to be large in proportion to the goodness of the pond from eight to twelve inches with regard to seafish the fishermen assure us that a fish must be six years old before it is fit to be served up to table they instance it in the growth of a mackarel they assure us that those a year old are as large as ones finger that those of two years are about twice that length at three and four years they are that small kind of mackarel that have neither melts nor rows and between five and six they are those full grown fish that are served up to our tables in the same manner with regard to flat fishes they tell us that the turbot and barble at one year are about the size of a crown piece the second year as large as the palm of ones hand and at the fifth and sixth year they are large enough to be served up to table thus it appears that fish are a considerable time in coming to their full growth and that they are a longtime destroyed before it comes to their turn to be destroyers traite des peche par monsieur duhamel sect   p  00   all fish live upon each other in some state of their existence those with the largest mouths attack and devour the larger kinds those whose mouths are less lie in wait for the smaller fry and even these chiefly subsist upon spawn of those which live in the ocean of the spinous kinds the dorado is the most voracious this is chiefly found in the tropical climates and is at once the most active and the most beautiful of the depiction of the flying fish the flying fish e martin sculp finny region it is about six feet long the back all over enamelled with spots of a bluish green and silver the tail and fins of a gold color and all have a brilliancy of tint that nothing but natures pencil can attain to the eyes are placed on each side of the head large and beautiful surrounded with circles of shining gold in the seas where they are found these fish are always in motion and playround ships in full sail with ease and security for ever either pursuing or pursued they are seen continually in a state of warfare either defending themselves against the shark or darting after the smaller fishes of all others the flyingfish most abounds in these seas and as it is a small animal seldom growing above the size of a herring it is chiefly sought by the dorado nature has furnished each respectively with the powers of pursuit and evasion the dorado being above six feet long yet not thicker than a salmon and furnished with a full complement of fins cuts its way through the water with amazing rapidity on the other hand the flyingfish is furnished with two pair of fins longer than the body and these also moved by a stronger set of muscles than any other this equality of power seems to furnish one of the most entertaining spectacles those seas can exhibit the efforts to seize on the one side and the arts of escaping on the other are perfectly amusing the dorado is seen upon this occasion darting after its prey which will not leave the water while it has the advantage of swimming in the beginning of the chase but like an hunted hare being tired at last it then has recourse to another expedient for safety by flight the long fins which began to grow useless in the water are now exerted in a different manner and different direction to that in which they were employed in swimming by this means the timid little animal rises from the water and flutters over its surface for two or three hundred yards till the muscles employed in moving the wings are enfeebled by that particular manner of exertion by this time however they have acquired a fresh power of renewing their efforts in the water and the animal is capable of proceeding with some velocity by swimming still however the active enemy keeps it in view and drives it again from the deep till at length the poor little creature is seen to dart to shorter distances to flutter with greater effort and to drop down at last into the mouth of its fierce pursuer but not the dorado alone all animated nature seems combined against this little fish which seems possessed of double powers only to be subject to greater dangers for though it should escape from its enemies of the deep yet the tropic bird and the albatross are for ever upon the wing to seize it thus pursued in either element it sometimes seeks refuge from a new enemy and it is not unfrequent for whole shoals of them to fall on shipboard where they furnish man with an object of useless curiosity  the warfare in fresh water is not carried on with such destructive activity nor are the inhabitants of that element so numerous it would seem that there is something more favorable to the fecundity of fishes in the ocean than in an element less impregnated with salt it has been the opinion of some philosophers that all fish are natives of that great reservoir and that only colonies have been sent up rivers either through accident or the necessity of procuring subsistence they have been led to this opinion by the superior fecundity of sea fish which breed twenty to one as well as by their superiority in strength and size over those of the same kind found in lakes and rivers this is a matter too remotely speculative to be worth pursuing but certain it is that in fresh water fishes seem to abate much of their courage and rapacity pursue each other with less violence and seem to be less powerfully actuated by all their appetites the greediness with which seafish devour the bait is prodigious if compared with the manner they take it in fresh water the lines of such fishermen as go off to sea are coarse thick and clumsy compared to what are used by those who fish at land their baits are seldom more than a piece of a fish or the flesh of some quadrupede stuck on the hook in a bungling manner and scarce any art is employed to conceal the deception but it is otherwise in fresh water the lines must often be drawn to an hairlike fineness they must be tinctured of the peculiar color of the stream the bait must be formed with the nicest art and even if possible to exceed the perfection of nature yet still the fishes approach it with diffidence and often swim round it with disdain the cod on the banks of newfoundland the instant the hook which is only baited with the guts of the animal last taken is dropped into the water darts to it at once and the fishermen have but to pull up as fast as they throw down but it is otherwise with those who fish in fresh waters they must wait whole hours in fruitless expectation and the patience of a fisherman is proverbial among us  this comparative neglect of food which is found in all the tribes of fresh water fishes renders them less turbulent and less destructive among each other of all these the pike is the most active and voracious and our poets whose business it is to observe the surface of nature have called it the tyrant of the watery plain in fact in proportion to its strength and celerity the pike does some mischief but what are its efforts compared to those of the cachalot or the shark they resemble the petty depredations of a robber put in competition with the ravages of a conqueror however the pike will attack every fish less than itself and it is sometimes seen choked by attempting to swallow such as are too large a morsel it is immaterial of what species the animal it pursues appears to be whether of another or its own all are indiscriminately devoured so that every fish owes its safety to its minuteness its celerity or its courage nor does the pike confine itself to feed on fish and frogs it will draw down the waterrat and the young ducks as they are swimming about gesner tells us of a mule that stooped to drink in the water when a famished pike that was near seized it by the nose nor was it disengaged till the beast flung it on shore so great is their rapacity that they will contend with the otter for his prey and even endeavor to force it from him for this reason it is dreaded by all other fish and the small ones show the same uneasiness and detestation at the presence of their tyrant as the little birds do at the sight of an hawk or an owl when the pike lies asleep near the surface as is frequently the case the lesser fish are often observed to swim around it in vast numbers with a mixture of caution and terror  the other tribes of fresh water fish are much inferior to this animal in courage and rapacity they chiefly subsist upon worms and insects pursuing them at the bottom or jumping after them to the surface of the water in winter also their appetite seems entirely to forsake them at least they continue in so torpid a state that few baits will tempt them to their destruction at that season they forsake the shallow waters and seek those deep holes to be found in every river where they continue for days together without ever appearing to move the cold seems to affect them for at that time they lie close to the bottom where the water is most warm and seldom venture out except the day be peculiarly fine and the shallows at the edges of the stream become tepified by the powerful rays of the sun indeed i have been assured that some fishes may be rendered so torpid by the cold in the northern rivers as to be frozen up in the great masses of ice in which they continue for several months together seemingly without life or sensation the prisoners of congelation and waiting the approach of a warmer sun to restore them at once to life and liberty thus that cheerful luminary not only distributes health and vegetation to the productions of the earth but is ardently sought even by the gelid inhabitants of the water  as fish are enemies one to another so each species is infested with worms of different kinds peculiar to itself the great fish abound with them and the little ones are not entirely free these troublesome vermin lodge themselves either in the jaws and the intestines internally or near the fins without when fish are healthy and fat they are not much annoyed by them but in winter when they are lean or sickly they then suffer very much  nor does the reputed longevity of this class secure them from their peculiar disorders they are not only affected by too much cold but there are frequently certain dispositions of the element in which they reside unfavourable to their health and propagation some ponds they will not breed in however artfully disposed for supplying them with fresh recruits of water as well as provision in some seasons they are found to feel epidemic disorders and are seen dead by the waterside without any apparent cause yet still they are animals of all others the most vivacious and they often live and subsist upon such substances as are poisonous to the more perfect classes of animated nature  it is not easy to determine whether the poisonous qualities which many of them are found to possess either when they wound our bodies externally with their spines or when they are unwarily eaten at our tables arises from this cause that numbers of fishes inflict poisonous wounds in the opinion of many cannot be doubted the concurrent testimony of mankind they think sufficient to contradict any reasonings upon this head taken from anatomical inspection the great pain that is felt from the sting given by the back fin of the weever bears no proportion to the smallness of the instrument that inflicts the wound how the poison is preserved or how it is conveyed by the animal it is not in our power to perceive but its actual existence has been often attested by painful experience in this instance we must decline conjecture satisfied with history  the fact of their being poisonous when eaten is equally notorious and the cause equally inscrutable my poor worthy friend dr grainger who resided for many years at st christophers assured me that of the fish caught of the same kind at one end of the island some were the best and most wholesome in the world while others taken at a different end were always dangerous and most commonly fatal we have a paper in the philosophical transactions giving an account of the poisonous qualities of those found at new providence one of the bahama islands the author there assures us that the greatest part of the fish of that dreary coast are all of a deadly nature their smallest effects being to bring on a terrible pain in the joints which if terminating favorably leaves the patient without any appetite for several days after it is not those of the most deformed figure or the most frightful to look at that are alone to be dreaded all kinds at different times are alike dangerous and the same species which has this day served for nourishment is the next if tried found to be fatal  this noxious quality has given rise to much speculation and many conjectures some have supposed it to arise from the fishes on these shores eating of the machinel apple a deadly vegetable poison that sometimes grows pendent over the sea but the quantity of those trees growing in this manner bears no proportion to the extensive infection of the fish labat has ascribed it to their eating the gally fish which is itself most potently poisonous but this only removes our wonder a little farther back for it may be asked with as just a cause for curiosity how comes the gally fish itself to procure its noxious qualities others have ascribed the poison of these fishes to their feeding upon coperas beds but i do not know of any copper mines found in america in short as we cannot describe the alembic by which the rattlesnake distills its malignity nor the process by which the scorpion that lives among roses converts their sweets to venom so we cannot discover the manner by which fishes become thus dangerous and it is well for us of europe that we can thus wonder in security it is certain that with us if fishes such as carp or tench acquire any disagreeable flavor from the lakes in which they have been bred this can be removed by their being kept some time in finer and better water there they soon clear away all those disagreeable qualities their flesh had contracted and become as delicate as if they had been always fed in the most cleanly manner but this expedient is with us rather the precaution of luxury than the effect of fear we have nothing to dread from the noxious qualities of our fish for all the animals our waters furnish are wholesome  happy england where the sea furnishes an abundant and luxurious repast and the fresh waters an innocent and harmless pastime where the angler in cheerful solitude strolls by the edge of the stream and fears neither the coiled snake nor the lurking crocodile where he can retire at night with his few trouts to borrow the pretty description of old walton to some friendly cottage where the landlady is good and the daughter innocent and beautiful where the room is cleanly with lavender in the sheets and twenty ballads stuck about the wall there he can enjoy the company of a talkative brother sportsman have his trouts dressed for supper tell tales sing old tunes or make a catch there he can talk of the wonders of nature with learned admiration or find some harmless sport to content him and pass away a little time without offense to god or injury to man  of crustaceous and testaceous fishes chap i of the division of shell fish in describing the inhabitants of the water a class of animals occur that mankind from the place of their residence have been content to call fish but that naturalists from their formation have justly agreed to be unworthy of the name indeed the affinity many of this kind bear to the insect tribe may very well plead for the historian who ranks them rather as insects however the common language of a country must not be slightly invaded the names of things may remain if the philosopher be careful to give precision to our ideas of them  there are two classes of animals therefore inhabiting the water which commonly receive the name of fishes entirely different from those we have been describing and also very distinct from each other these are divided by naturalists into crustaceous and testaceous animals both totally unlike fishes to appearance seem to invert the order of nature and as those have their bones on the inside and their muscles hung upon them for the purposes of life and motion these on the contrary have all their bony parts on the outside and all their muscles within not to talk mysteriously  all who have seen a lobster or an oyster perceive that the shell in these bears a strong analogy to the bones of other animals and that by these shells the animal is sustained and defended  crustaceous fish such as the crab and the lobster have a shell not quite of a stony hardness but rather resembling a firm crust and in some measure capable of yielding testaceous fishes such as the oyster or cockle are furnished with a shell of a stony hardness very brittle and incapable of yielding of the crustaceous kinds are the lobster the crab and the tortoise of the testaceous that numerous tribe of oysters muscles cockles and sea snails which offer with infinite variety  the crustaceous tribe seem to hold the middle rank between fishes properly so called and those snail like animals that receive the name of testaceous fishes their muscles are strong and firm as in the former their shell is selfproduced as among the latter they have motion and hunt for food with great avidity like the former they are incapable of swimming but creep along the bottom like the latter in short they form the link that unites these two classes that seem so very opposite in their natures  of testaceous fishes we will speak hereafter as to animals of the crustaceous kind they are very numerous their figure offers an hundred varieties but as to their nature they are obviously divided into two very distinct kinds differing in their habits and their conformation the chief of one kind is the lobster the chief of the other the tortoise under the lobster we rank the prawn the cray fish the shrimp the sea crab the land crab and all their varieties under the sea tortoise the turtle the hawksbill turtle the land tortoise and their numerous varieties  chap ii crustaceous animals of the lobster kind however different in figure the lobster and the crab may seem their manners and conformation are nearly the same with all the voracious appetites of fishes they are condemned to lead an insect life at the bottom of the water and though pressed by continual hunger they are often obliged to wait till accident brings them their prey though without any warmth in their bodies or even without red blood circulating through their veins they are animals wonderfully voracious whatever they seize upon that has life is sure to perish though never so well defended they even devour each other and to increase our surprise still more they may in some measure be said to eat themselves as they change their shell and their stomach every year and their old stomach is generally the first morsel that serves to glut the new  the lobster is an animal of so extraordinary a form that those who first see it are apt to mistake the head for the tail but it is soon discovered that the animal moves with its claws foremost and that the part which plays within itself by joints like a coat of armor is the tail the two great claws are the lobsters instruments of provision and defense these by opening like a pair of nippers have great strength and take a firm hold they are usually notched like a saw which still more increases their tenacity beside these powerful instruments which may be considered as arms the lobster has eight legs four on each side and these with the tail serve to give the animal its progressive and sideling motion between the two claws is the animals head very small and furnished with eyes that seem like two black horny specks on each side and these it has a power of advancing out of the socket and drawing in at pleasure the mouth like that of insects opens the long way of the body not crossways as with man and the higher race of animals it is furnished with two teeth for the comminution of its food but as these are not sufficient it has three more in the stomach one on each side and the other below between the two teeth there is a fleshy substance in the shape of a tongue the intestines consist of one long bowel which reaches from the mouth to the vent but what this animal differs in from all others is that the spinal marrow is in the breast bone it is furnished with two long feelers or horns that issue on each side of the head that seem to correct the dimness of its sight and apprize the animal of its danger or of its prey the tail or that jointed instrument at the other end is the grand instrument of motion and with this it can raise itself in the water under this we usually see lodged the spawn in great abundance every pea adhering to the next by a very fine filament which is scarcely perceivable every lobster is an hermaphrodite and is supposed to be selfimpregnated the ovary or place where the spawn is first produced is backwards toward the tail where a red substance is always found and which is nothing but a cluster of peace that are yet too small for exclusion from this receptacle there go two canals that open on each side at the jointures of the shell at the belly and through these passages the peace descend to be excluded and placed under the tail where the animal preserves them from danger for some time until they come to maturity when being furnished with limbs and motion they drop off into the water  when the young lobsters leave the parent they immediately seek for refuge in the smallest clefts of rocks and in such like crevices at the bottom of the sea where the entrance is but small and the opening can be easily defended there without seeming to take any food they grow larger in a few weeks time from the mere accidental substances which the water washes to their retreats by this time also they acquire an hard firm shell which furnishes them with both offensive and defensive armor they then begin to issue from their fortresses and boldly creep along the bottom in hopes of meeting with more diminutive plunder the spawn of fish the smaller animals of their own kind but chiefly the worms that keep at the bottom of the sea supply them with plenty they keep in this manner close among the rocks busily employed in scratching up the sand with their claws for worms or surprising such heedless animals as fall within their grasp thus they have little to apprehend except from each other for in them as among fishes the large are the most formidable of all other enemies to the small  but this life of abundance and security is soon to have a most dangerous interruption for the body of the lobster still continuing to increase while its shell remains inalterably the same the animal becomes too large for its habitation and imprisoned within the crust that has naturally gathered round it there comes on a necessity of getting free the young of this kind therefore that grow faster as i am assured by the fishermen change their shell oftener than the old who come to their full growth and who remain in the same shell often for two years together in general however all these animals change their shell once a year and this is not only a most painful operation but also subjects them to every danger their molting season is generally about the beginning of summer at which time their food is in plenty and their strength and vigor in the highest perfection but soon all their activity ceases they are seen forsaking the open parts of the deep and seeking some retired situation among the rocks or some outlet where they may remain in safety from the attacks of their various enemies for some days before their change the animal discontinues its usual voraciousness it is no longer seen laboriously harrowing up the sand at the bottom or fighting with others of its kind or hunting its prey it lies torpid and motionless as if in anxious expectation of the approaching change just before casting its shell it throws itself upon its back strikes its claws against each other and every limb seems to tremble its feelers are agitated and the whole body is in violent motion it then swells itself in an unusual manner and at last the shell is seen beginning to divide at its junctures particularly it opens at the junctures of the belly where like a pair of jumps it was before but seemingly united it also seems turned inside out and its stomach comes away with its shell after this by the same operation it disengages itself of the claws which burst at the joints the animal with a tremulous motion casting them off as a man would kick off a boot that was too big for him  thus in a short time this wonderful creature finds itself at liberty but in so weak and enfeebled a state that it continues for several hours motionless indeed so violent and painful is the operation that many of them die under it and those which survive are in such a weakly state for some time that they neither take food nor venture from their retreats immediately after this change they have not only the softness but the timidity of a worm every animal of the deep is then a powerful enemy which they can neither escape nor oppose and this in fact is the time when the dogfish the cod and the ray devour them by hundreds but this state of defenseless imbecility continues for a very short time the animal in less than two days is seen to have the skin that covered its body grown almost as hard as before its appetite is seen to increase and strange to behold the first object that tempts its gluttony is its own stomach which it so lately was disengaged from this it devours with great eagerness and some time after eats even its former shell in about fortyeight hours in proportion to the animals health and strength the new shell is perfectly formed and as hard as that which was but just thrown aside  to contribute to the speedy growth of the shell it is supposed by some that the lobster is supplied with a very extraordinary concretion within its body that is converted into the shelly substance it is a chalky substance found in the lower part of the stomach of all lobsters improperly called crabs eyes and sold under that title in the shops about the time the lobster quits its shell the teeth in its stomach break these stones to pieces and the fluids contained therein dissolve them this fluid which still remains in the new stomach is thought to be replete with a petrifying quality proper for forming a new shell however the concreting power that first formed these shows a sufficient power in the animal to produce also the shell and it is going but a short way in the causes of things when we attempt to explain one wonder by another  when the lobster is completely equipped in its new shell it then appears how much it has grown in the space of a very few days the dimensions of the old shell being compared with those of the new it will be found that the creature is increased above a third in its size and like a boy that has outgrown his clothes it seems wonderful how the deserted shell was able to contain so great an animal as entirely fills up the new  the creature thus furnished not only with a complete covering but also a greater share of strength and courage ventures more boldly among the animals at bottom and not a week passes that in its combats it does not suffer some mutilation a joint or even a whole claw is sometimes snapped off in these encounters at certain seasons of the year these animals never meet each other without an engagement in these to come off with the loss of a leg or even a claw is considered as no great calamity the victor carries off the spoil to feast upon at his leisure while the other retires from the defeat to wait for a thorough repair this repair is not long in procuring from the place where the joint of the claw was cut away is seen in a most surprising manner to burgeon out the beginning of a new claw this if observed at first is small and tender but grows in the space of three weeks to be almost as large and as powerful as the old one i say almost as large for it never arrives to the full size and this is the reason we generally find the claws of the lobsters of unequal magnitude  after what has been thus described let us pause a little to reflect on the wonders this extraordinary creature offers to our imagination an animal without bones on the inside yet furnished with a stomach capable of digesting the hardest substances the shells of muscles of oysters and even its own an animal gaining a new stomach and a new shell at stated intervals furnished with the instruments of generation double in both sexes and yet with an apparent incapacity of uniting without red blood circulating through the body and yet apparently vigorous and active but most strange of all an animal endowed with a vital principle that furnishes out such limbs as have been cut away and keeps continually combating it though in constant repair to renew its engagements  these are but a small part of the wonders of the deep where nature sports without a spectator  of this extraordinary yet well known animal there are many varieties with some differences depiction of the the violet crab the river crab the sea lobster and the lobster crab   the violet crab   the river crab   the sea lobster   the lobster crab  e martin sculp in the claws but little in the habits or conformation it is found above three feet long and if we may admit the shrimp and the prawn into the class though unfurnished with claws it is seen not above an inch these all live in the water and can bear its absence for but a few hours the shell is black when taken out of the water but turns red by boiling the most common way of taking the lobster is in a basket or pot as the fishermen call it made of wickerwork in which they put the bait and then throw it to the bottom of the sea in six or ten fathom water the lobsters creep into this for the sake of the bait but are not able to get out again the river crawfish differs little from the lobster but that the one will live only in fresh water and the other will thrive only in the sea  the crab is an animal found equally in fresh and salt water as well upon land as in the ocean in shape it differs very much from the lobster but entirely resembles it in habits and conformation the tail in this animal is not so apparent as in the former being that broad flap that seems to cover a part of the belly and when lifted discovers the peace or spawn situated there in great abundance it resembles the lobster in the number of its claws which are two and its legs which are eight four on either side like the lobster it is a bold voracious animal and such an enmity do crabs bear each other that those who carry them for sale to market often tie their claws with strings to prevent their fighting and maiming themselves by the way in short it resembles the lobster in every thing but the amazing bulk of its body compared to the size of its head and the length of its intestines which have many convolutions  as the crab however is found upon land as well as in the water the peculiarity of its situation produces a difference in its habitudes which it is proper to describe the land crab is found in some of the warmer regions of europe and in great abundance in all the tropical cimates in africa and america they are of various kinds and endued with various properties some being healthful delicious and nourishing food others poisonous or malignant to the last degree some are not above half an inch broad others are found a foot over some are of a dirty brown and others beautifully mottled that animal called the violet crab of the caribbee islands is the most noted both for its shape the delicacy of its flesh and the singularity of its manners  the violet crab somewhat resembles two hands cut through the middle and joined together for each side looks like four fingers and the two nippers or claws resemble the thumbs all the rest of the body is covered with a shell as large as a mans hand and bunched in the middle on the forepart of which there are two long eyes of the size of a grain of barley as transparent as crystal and as hard as horn a little below these is the mouth covered with a sort of barbs under which there are two broad sharp teeth as white as snow they are not placed as in other animals crossways but in the opposite direction not much unlike the blades of a pair of scissars with these teeth they can easily cut leaves fruits and rotten wood which is their usual food but their principal instrument for cutting and seizing their food is their nippers which catch such an hold that the animal loses the limb sooner than its grasp and is often seen scampering off having left its claw still holding fast upon the enemy the faithful claw seems to perform its duty and keeps for above a minute fastened upon the finger while the crab is making off brown jamaic      in fact it loses no great matter by leaving a leg or an arm for they soon grow again and the animal is found as perfect as before  this however is the least surprising part of this creatures history and what i am going to relate were it not as well known and as confidently confirmed as any other circumstance in natural history it might well stagger our belief these animals live not only in a kind of orderly society in their retreats in the mountains but regularly once a year march down to the seaside in a body of some millions at a time as they multiply in great numbers they choose the months of april or may to begin their expedition and then sally out by thousands from the stumps of hollow trees from the clefts of rocks and from the holes which they dig for themselves under the surface of the earth at that time the whole ground is covered with this band of adventurers there is no setting down ones foot without treading upon them labat voyage aux isle francoise vol ii p      the sea is their place of destination and to that they direct their march with rightlined precision no geometrician could send them to their destined station by a shorter course they neither turn to the right or left whatever obstacles intervene and even if they meet with a house they will attempt to scale the walls to keep the unbroken tenor of their way but though this be the general order of their route they upon other occasions are compelled to conform to the face of the country and if it be intersected by rivers they are then seen to wind along the course of the stream the procession sets forward from the mountains with the regularity of an army under the guidance of an experienced commander they are commonly divided into three battalions of which the first consists of the strongest and boldest males that like pioneers march forward to clear the route and face the greatest dangers these are often obliged to halt for want of rain and go into the most convenient encampment till the weather changes the main body of the army is composed of females which never leave the mountains till the rain is set in for some time and then descend in regular battalia being formed into columns of fifty paces broad and three miles deep and so close that they almost cover the ground three or four days after this the rearguard follows a straggling undisciplined tribe consisting of males and females but neither so robust nor so numerous as the former the night is their chief time of proceeding but if it rains by day they do not fail to profit by the occasion and they continue to move forward in their slow uniform manner when the sun shines and is hot upon the surface of the ground they then make an universal halt and wait till the cool of the evening when they are terrified they march back in a confused disorderly manner holding up their nippers with which they sometimes tear off a piece of the skin and then leave the weapon where they inflicted the wound they even try to intimidate their enemies for they often clatter their nippers together as if it were to threaten those that come to disturb them but though they thus strive to be formidable to man they are much more so to each other for they are possessed of one most unsocial property which is that if any of them by accident is maimed in such a manner as to be incapable of proceeding the rest fall upon and devour it on the spot and then pursue their journey  when after a fatiguing march and escaping a thousand dangers for they are sometimes three months in getting to the shore they have arrived at their destined port they prepare to cast their spawn the peace are as yet within their bodies and not excluded as is usual in animals of this kind under the tail for the creature waits for the benefit of the seawater to help the delivery for this purpose the crab has no sooner reached the shore than it eagerly goes to the edge of the water and lets the waves wash over its body two or three times this seems only a preparation for bringing their spawn to maturity for without farther delay they withdraw to seek a lodging upon land in the mean time the spawn grows larger is excluded out of the body and sticks to the barbs under the flap or more properly the tail this bunch is seen as big as an hens egg and exactly resembling the rows of herrings in this state of pregnancy they once more seek the shore for the last time and shaking off their spawn into the water leave accident to bring it to maturity at this time whole shoals of hungry fish are at the shore in expectation of this annual supply the sea to a great distance seems black with them and about two thirds of the crabs eggs are immediately devoured by these rapacious invaders the eggs that escape are hatched under the sand and soon after millions at a time of these little crabs are seen quitting the shore and slowly traveling up to the mountains  the old ones however are not so active to return they have become so feeble and lean that they can hardly creep along and the flesh at that time changes its color the most of them therefore are obliged to continue in the flat parts of the country till they recover making holes in the earth which they cover at the mouth with leaves and dirt so that no air may enter there they throw off their old shells which they leave as it were quite whole the place where they opened on the belly being unseen at that time they are quite naked and almost without motion for six days together when they become so fat as to be delicious food they have then under their stomachs four large white stones which gradually decrease in proportion as the shell hardens and when they come to perfection are not to be found it is at that time that the animal is seen slowly making its way back and all this is most commonly performed in the space of six weeks  this animal when possessed of its retreats in the mountains is impregnable for only subsisting upon vegetables it seldom ventures out and its habitation being in the most inaccessible places it remains for a great part of the season in perfect security it is only when impelled by the desire of bringing forth its young and when compelled to descend into the flat country that it is taken at that time the natives wait for its descent in eager expectation and destroy thousands but disregarding the bodies they only seek for that small spawn which lies on each side of the stomach within the shell of about the thickness of a mans thumb they are much more valuable upon their return after they have cast their shell for being covered with a skin resembling soft parchment almost every part except the stomach may be eaten they are taken in their holes by feeling for them in the ground with an instrument they are sought after by night when on their journey with flambeaux the instant the animal perceives itself attacked it throws itself on its back and with its claws pinches most terribly whatever it happens to fasten on but the dextrous crabcatcher takes them by the hinder legs in such a manner that its nippers cannot touch him and thus he throws it into his bag sometimes also they are caught when they take refuge at the bottom of holes in rocks by the seaside by clapping a stick at the mouth of the hole which prevents their getting out and then soon after the tide coming enters the hole and the animal is found upon its retiring drowned in its retreat  these crabs are of considerable advantage to the natives and the slaves very often feed entirely upon them in jamaica where they are found in great plenty they are considered as one of the greatest delicacies of the place yet still the eating of them is attended with some danger for even of this kind many are found poisonous being fed as it is thought upon the makinel apple and whenever they are found under that noxious plant they are always rejected with caution it is thus with almost all the productions of those luxurious climates however tempting they may be to the appetite they but too often are found destructive and scarce a delicacy among them that does not carry its own alloy  the descent of these creatures for such important purposes deserves our admiration but there is an animal of the lobster kind that annually descends from its mountains in like manner and for purposes still more important and various its descent is not only to produce an offspring but to provide itself a covering not only to secure a family but to furnish an house the animal i mean is the soldiercrab which has some similitude to the lobster if divested of its shell it is usually about four inches long has no shell behind but is covered down to the tail with a rough skin terminating in a point it is however armed with strong hard nippers before like the lobster and one of them is as thick as a mans thumb and pinches most powerfully it is as i said without a shell to any part except its nippers but what nature has denied this animal it takes care to supply by art and taking possession of the deserted shell of some other animal it resides in it till by growing too large for its habitation it is under a necessity of change it is a native of the west india islands and like the former it is seen every year descending from the mountains to the seashore to deposit its spawn and to provide itself with a new shell this is a most bustling time with it having so many things to do and in fact very busy it appears it is very probable that its first care is to provide for its offspring before it attends to its own wants and it is thought from the number of little shells which it is seen examining that it deposits its spawn in them which thus is placed in perfect security till the time of exclusion  however this be the soldier is in the end by no means unmindful of itself it is still seen in its old shell which it appears to have considerably outgrown for a part of the naked body is seen at the mouth of it which the habitation is too small to hide a shell therefore is to be found large enough to cover the whole body and yet not so large as to be unmanageable and unwieldy to answer both these ends is no easy matter nor the attainment of a slight enquiry the little soldier is seen busily parading the shore along that line of pebbles and shells that is formed by the extremest wave still however dragging its old incommodious habitation at its tail unwilling to part with one shell even though a troublesome appendage till it can find another more convenient it is seen stopping at one shell turning it and passing it by going on to another contemplating that for a while and then slipping its tail from its old habitation to try on the new this also is found to be inconvenient and it quickly returns to its old shell again in this manner it frequently changes till at last it finds one light roomy and commodious to this it adheres though the shell be sometimes so large as to hide the body of the animal claws and all pere du testre   yet it is not till after many trials but many combats also that the soldier is thus completely equipped for there is often a contest between two of them for some well looking favorite shell for which they are rivals they both endeavor to take possession they strike with their claws they bite each other till the weakest is obliged to yield by giving up the object of dispute it is then that the victor immediately takes possession and parades it in his new conquest three or four times back and forward upon the strand before his envious antagonist  when this animal is taken it sends forth a feeble cry endeavoring to seize the enemy with its nippers which if it fastens upon it will sooner die than quit the grasp the wound is very painful and not easily cured for this reason and as it is not much esteemed for its flesh it is generally permitted to return to its old retreat to the mountains in safety there it continues till the necessity of changing once more and the desire of producing an offspring expose it to fresh dangers the year ensuing  chap iii of the tortoise and its kinds having described the lobster and the crab as animals in some measure approaching to the insect tribes it will appear like injustice to place the tortoise among the number that from its strength its docility the warm red blood that is circulating in its veins deserves to be ranked even above the fishes but as this animal is covered like the lobster with a shell as it is of an amphibious nature and brings forth its young from the egg without hatching we must be content to degrade it among animals that in every respect it infinitely surpasses  tortoises are usually divided into those that live upon land and those that subsist in the water and use has made a distinction even in the name the one being called tortoises the other turtles however seba has proved that all tortoises are amphibious that the land tortoise will live in the water and that the sea turtle can be fed upon land a land tortoise was brought to him that was caught in one of the canals of amsterdam which he kept for half a year in his house where it lived very well contented in both elements when in the water it remained with its head above the surface when placed in the sun it seemed delighted with its beams and continued immovable while it felt their warmth the difference therefore in these animals arises rather from their habits than their conformation and upon examination there will be less variety found between them than between birds that live upon land and those that swim upon the water  yet though nature seems to have made but few distinctions among these animals as to their conformation yet in their habits they are very dissimilar as these result from the different qualities of their food and the different sorts of enemies they have to avoid or encounter i will therefore exhibit their figure and conformation under one common description by which their slight differences will be more obvious and then i will give a separate history of the manners of each as naturalists and travelers have taught us  all tortoises in their external form pretty much resemble each other their outward covering being composed of two great shells the one laid upon the other and only touching at the edges however when we come to look closer we shall find that the upper shell is composed of no less than thirteen pieces which are laid flat upon the ribs like the tiles of an house by which the shell is kept arched and supported the shells both above and below that which seem to an inattentive observer to make each but one piece are bound together at the edges by very strong and hard ligaments yet with some small share of motion there are two holes at either edge of this vaulted body one for a very small head shoulders and arms to peep through the other at the opposite edge for the feet and the tail these shells the animal is never disengaged from and they serve for its defense against every creature but man  the tortoise has but a small head with no teeth having only two bony ridges in the place serrated and hard these serve to gather and grind its food and such is the amazing strength of the jaws that it is impossible to open them where they once have fastened even when the head is cut off the jaws still keep their hold and the muscles in death preserve a tenacious rigidity indeed the animal is possessed of equal strength in all other parts of its body the legs though short are inconceivably strong and torpid as the tortoise may appear it has been known to carry five men standing upon its back with apparent ease and unconcern its manner of going forward is by moving its legs one after the other and the claws with which the toes are furnished sink into the ground like the nails of an iron shod wheel and thus assist its progression  with respect to its internal parts not to enter into minute anatomical disquisitions it may not be improper to observe that the blood circulates in this animal as in some cartilaginous fishes and something in the manner of a child in the womb the greatest quantity of the blood passes directly from the vena cava into the left ventricle of the heart which communicates with the right ventricle by an opening while the auricles only receive what the ventricles seem incapable of admitting thus the blood is driven by a very short passage through the circulation and the lungs seem to lend only occasional assistance from this conformation the animal can subsist for some time without using the lungs or breathing at least the lungs are not so necessary an instrument for driving on the circulation as with us  such is the general structure of this animal whether found to live by land or water with regard to the differences of these animals the land tortoise from its habits of making use of its feet in walking is much more nimble upon land than the sea turtle the land tortoise if thrown upon its back by rocking and balancing its body like a child rocking in a cradle at last turns itself upon its face again but the turtle when once turned continues without being able to move from the spot in comparing the feet also of these animals the nails upon the toes of one that has been long used to scratch for subsistence upon land are blunt and worn while those that have only been employed in swimming are sharp and long and have more the similitude of fins the brain of the land tortoise is but small and yet it is three times as large as that of the turtle there is a difference also in the shape of their eggs and in the passage by which they are excluded for in the land tortoise the passage is so narrow that the egg conforms to the shape of the aperture and though round when in the body yet becomes much more oblong than those of fowls upon being excluded otherwise they would never be able to pass through the bony canal by which they are protruded on the contrary the passage is wider in the turtle and therefore its eggs are round these are the most striking distinctions but that which is most known is their size the land tortoise often not exceeding three feet long by two feet broad the sea turtle being sometimes from five to seven feet long the size however is but a fallacious distinction since land tortoises in some parts of india grow to a very great magnitude though probably not as the ancients affirm big enough for a single shell to serve for the covering of an house  but if the different kinds of tortoises are not sufficiently distinguished by their figure they are very obviously distinguishable by their methods of living the land tortoise lives in holes dug in the mountains or near marshy lakes the sea turtle in cavities of rocks and extensive pastures at the bottom of the sea the tortoise makes use of its feet to walk with and burrow in the ground the turtle chiefly uses its feet in swimming or creeping at bottom  the land tortoise is generally found as was observed above from one foot to five feet long from the end of the snout to the end of the tail and from five inches to a foot and an half across the back it has a small head somewhat resembling that of a serpent an eye without the upper lid the under eyelid serving to cover and keep that organ in safety it has a strong scaly tail like the lizard its head the animal can put out and hide at pleasure under the great penthouse of its shell there it can remain secure from all attacks there defended on every side it can fatigue the patience of the most formidable animal of the forest that makes use only of natural strength to destroy it as the tortoise lives wholly upon vegetable food it never seeks the encounter yet if any of the smaller animals attempt to invade its repose they are sure to suffer the tortoise impregnably defended is furnished with such a strength of jaw that though armed only with bony plates instead of teeth wherever it fastens it infallibly keeps its hold until it has taken out the piece  though peaceable in itself it is formed for war in another respect for it seems almost endued with immortality nothing can kill it the depriving it of one of its members is but a slight injury it will live though deprived of the brain it will live though deprived of its head redi informs us that in making some experiments upon vital motion he in the beginning of the month of november took a land tortoise made a large opening in its skull and drew out all the brain washed the cavity so as not to leave the smallest part remaining and then leaving the hole open set the animal at liberty notwithstanding this the tortoise marched away without seeming to have received the smallest injury only it shut the eyes and never opened them afterward soon after the hole in the skull was seen to close and in three days there was a complete skin covering the wound in this manner the animal lived without a brain for six months walking about unconcernedly and moving its limbs as before but the italian philosopher not satisfied with this experiment carried it still farther for he cut off the head and the animal lived twentythree days after its separation from the body the head also continued to rattle the jaws like a pair of castanets for above a quarter of an hour  nor are these animals less long lived than difficult in destroying tortoises are commonly known to exceed eighty years old and there was one kept in the archbishop of canterburys garden at lambeth that was remembered above an hundred and twenty it was at last killed by the severity of a frost from which it had not sufficiently defended itself in its winter retreat which was a heap of sand at the bottom of the garden  the usual food of the land tortoise seems not so nourishing as to supply this extraordinary principle of vitality it lives upon vegetables in its retreats in the mountains or the plain and seldom makes its prey of snails or worms but when other food is not found in grateful plenty it is fond also of fruits and when the forest affords them is generally found not far from where they grow as it can move but slowly it is not very delicate in the choice of its food so that it usually fills itself with whatever offers those that are kept in a domestic state will eat any thing leaves fruits corn bran or grass  from the smallness of its brain and the slowness of its motion it obviously appears to be a torpid heavy animal requiring rest and sleep and in fact it retires to some cavern to sleep for the winter i already observed that its blood circulated through the heart by a short passage and that it did not as anatomists express it go through the great circulation with us and quadrupes the blood goes from the veins to the heart from the heart it is sent to be spread over the lungs from the lungs it returns to the heart again and from thence it goes to the arteries to be distributed through the whole body but its passage in the tortoise is much shorter for from the veins it goes to the heart then leaving the lungs entirely out of its course it takes a short cut if i may so say into the beginning of the arteries which send it round the animal frame from hence we see the lungs are left out of the circulation and consequently the animal is capable of continuing to live without continuing to breathe in this it resembles the bat the serpent the mole and the lizard like them it takes up its dark residence for the winter and at that time when its food is no longer in plenty it happily becomes insensible to the want nor is it unmindful to prepare its retreat and make it as convenient as possible it is sometimes buried two or three feet in the ground with its hole furnished with moss grass and other substances as well to keep the retreat warm as to serve for food in case it should prematurely wake from its state of stupefaction but it must not be supposed that while it is thus at rest it totally discontinues to breathe on the contrary an animal of this kind if put into a close vessel without air will soon be stifled though not so readily as in a state of vigor and activity  from this dormant state the tortoise is awakened by the genial return of spring and is thought not to be much wasted by its long confinement to animals that live an hundred and fifty years a sleep of six months is but as the nap of a night all the actions of these long lived creatures seem formed upon a scale answering the length of their existence their slumbers are for a season their motions are slow and require time in every action even the act of procreation which among other animals is performed in a very few minutes is with them the business of days about a month after their enlargement from a torpid state they prepare to transmit their posterity and both continue joined for near a month together the eggs of the female are contained in the ovary above the bladder which is extremely large and these are before their exclusion round and naked with spots of red after they are laid however they assume another form being smaller and longer than those of a hen this alteration in the figure of the eggs most probably proceeds from the narrowness of the bony passage through which they are excluded swammerdam who compared the size of the eggs taken out of this animals body with the diameter of the passage through which they were excluded was of opinion that the bones themselves separated from each other and closed again but in my opinion it is more probable to suppose that the eggs and not the bones alter their form certain it is that they are round in the body and that they are oval upon being protruded  the eggs of all the tortoise kind like those of birds are furnished with a yolk and a white but the shell is different being somewhat like those soft eggs that hens exclude before their time however this shell is much thicker and stronger and is a longer time in coming to maturity in the womb the land tortoise lays but a few in number if compared to the sea turtle who deposits from an hundred and fifty to two hundred in a season  the amount of the land tortoises eggs i have not been able to learn but from the scarceness of the animal i am apt to think they cannot be very numerous when it prepares to lay the female scratches a slight depression in the earth generally in a warm situation where the beams of the sun have their full effect there depositing her eggs and covering them with grass and leaves she forsakes them to be hatched by the heat of the season the young tortoises are generally excluded in about twentysix days but as the heat of the weather assists or its coldness retards incubation sometimes it happens that there is a difference of two or three days the little animals no sooner leave the egg than they seek for their provision entirely selftaught and their shell with which they are covered from the beginning expands and grows larger with age as it is composed of a variety of pieces they are all capable of extension at their futures and the shell admits of increase in every direction it is otherwise with those animals like the lobster whose shell is composed all of one piece that admits of no increase which when the tenant is too big for the habitation must burst the shell and get another but the covering of the tortoise grows larger in proportion as the internal parts expand in some measure resembling the growth of the human skull which is composed of a number of bones increasing in size in proportion to the quantity of the brain all tortoises therefore as they never change their shell must have it formed in pieces and though in some that have been described by painters or historians these marks have not been attended to yet we can have no doubt that they are general to the whole tribe  it is common enough to take these animals into gardens as they are thought to destroy insects and snails in great abundance we are even told that in hot countries they are admitted into a domestic state as they are great destroyers of bugs how so large and heavy an animal is capable of being expert at such petty prey is not easy to conceive but i have depiction of the turtle and the tortoise   the sea tortoise or turtle v   p       the land tortoise v   p   0  e martin sc  seen several of them about gentlemens houses that in general appear torpid harmless and even fond of employment children have sometimes got upon the back of a tortoise and such was the creatures strength that it never seemed overloaded but moved off with its burden to where it expected to be fed but would carry them no further in winter they regularly find out a place to sleep in but in those warm countries in which the tortoise is found larger and in greater plenty than in europe they live without retiring the whole year round  the sea tortoise or turtle as it is now called is generally found larger than the former this element is possessed with the property of increasing the magnitude of those animals which are common to the land and the ocean the sea pike is larger than that of fresh water the sea bear is larger than that of the mountains and the sea turtle exceeds the land tortoise in the same proportion it is of different magnitudes according to its different kinds some turtles being not above fifty pound weight and some above eight hundred  the great mediterranean turtle is the largest of the turtle kind with which we are acquainted it is found from five to eight feet long and from six to nine hundred pounds weight but unluckily its utility bears no proportion to its size as it is unfit for food and sometimes poison those who eat it the shell also which is a tough strong integument resembling an hide is unfit for all serviceable purposes one of these animals was taken in the year      at the mouth of the loire in nets that were not designed for so large a capture this turtle which was of enormous strength by its own struggles involved itself in the nets in such a manner as to be incapable of doing mischief yet even thus shackled it appeared terrible to the fishermen who were at first for flying but finding it impotent they gathered courage to drag it on shore where it made a most horrible bellowing and when they began to knock it on the head with their gaffs it was to be heard at half a miles distance they were still further intimidated by its nauseous and pestilential breath which so powerfully affected them that they were near fainting this animal wanted but four inches of being eight feet long and was above two feet over its shell more resembled leather than the shell of a tortoise and unlike all other animals of this kind it was furnished with teeth in each jaw one rank behind another like those of a shark its feet also different from the rest of this kind wanted claws and the tail was quite disengaged from the shell and fifteen inches long more resembling that of a quadrupede than a tortoise this animal was then unknown upon the coasts of france and was supposed to have been brought into the european seas in some india ship that might be wrecked upon her return since that however two or three of these animals have been taken upon the coasts two in particular upon those of cornwall in the year      the largest of which weighed eight hundred pounds and one upon the isle of rhea but two years before that weighed between seven and eight hundred one most probably of this kind also was caught about thirty years ago near scarborough and a good deal of company was invited to feast upon it a gentleman who was one of the guests told the company that it was a mediterranean turtle and not wholesome but a person who was willing to satisfy his appetite at the risque of his life eat of it he was seized with a violent vomiting and purging but his constitution overpowered the malignity of the poison  these are a formidable and useless kind if compared to the turtle caught in the south seas and the indian ocean these are of different kinds not only unlike each other in form but furnishing man with very different advantages they are usually distinguished by sailors into four kinds the trunk turtle the loggerhead the hawksbill and the green turtle  the trunk turtle is commonly larger than the rest and its back higher and rounder the flesh of this is rank and not very wholesome  the loggerhead is so called from the largeness of its head which is much bigger in proportion than that of the other kinds the flesh of this also is very rank and not eaten but in case of necessity  the hawksbill turtle is the least of the four and has a long and small mouth somewhat resembling the bill of an hawk the flesh of this also is very indifferent eating but the shell serves for the most valuable purposes this is the animal that supplies the tortoiseshell of which such a variety of beautiful trinkets are made the substance of which the shells of other turtles are composed is thin and porous but that of the hawksbill is firm and when polished is beautifully marbled they generally carry about three pounds but the largest of all six pounds the shell consists as in all the kind of thirteen leaves or plates of which eight are flat and five hollow they are raised and taken off by means of fire which is made under under the shell after the flesh is taken out as soon as the heat affects the leaves they start from the ribs and are easily raised with the point of a knife by being scraped and polished on both sides they become beautifully transparent or are easily cast into what form the workman thinks proper by making them soft and pliant in warm water and then screwing them in a mold like a medal however the shell is most beautiful before it undergoes this last operation  but of all animals of the tortoise kind the green turtle is the most noted and the most valuable the delicacy of its flesh and its nutritive qualities together with the property of being easily digested were for above a century known only to our seamen and the inhabitants of the coasts where they were taken it was not till by slow degrees the distinction came to be made between such as were malignant and such as were wholesome the controversies and contradictions of our old travelers were numerous upon this head some asserting that the turtle was delicious food and others that it was actual poison dampier that rough seaman who has added more to natural history than half of the philosophers that went before him appears to be the first who informed us of their distinctions and that while the rest might be valuable for other purposes the green turtle alone was chiefly prized for the delicacy of its flesh he never imagined however that this animal would make its way to the luxurious tables of europe for he seems chiefly to recommend it as salted up for ships provision in case of necessity  at present the turtle is very well known among us and is become the favorite food of those that are desirous of eating a great deal without the danger of surfeiting this is a property the flesh of the turtle seems peculiarly possessed of and by the importation of it alive among us gluttony is freed from one of its greatest restraints the flesh of turtle is become a branch of commerce and therefore ships are provided with conveniences for supplying them with water and provision to bring them over in health from jamaica and other west india islands this however is not always effected for though they are very vivacious and scarce require any provision upon the voyage yet by the working of the ship and their beating against the sides of the boat that contains them they become battered and lean so that to eat this animal in the highest perfection instead of bringing the turtle to the epicure he ought to be transported to the turtle  this animal is called the green turtle from the color of its shell which is rather greener than that of others of this kind it is generally found about two hundred weight though some are five hundred and others not above fifty dampier tells us of one that was seen at port royal in jamaica that was six feet broad across the back he does not tell us its other dimensions but says that the son of captain roach a boy about ten years old sailed in the shell as in a boat from the shore to his fathers ship which was above a quarter of a mile from land but this is nothing to the size of some turtles the ancients speak of aelian assures us that the houses in the island of taprobane are usually covered with a single shell diodorus siculus tells us that a people neighboring on ethiopia called the turtleeaters coasted along the shore in boats made of the upper shell of this animal and that in war when they had eaten the flesh the covering served them as a tent in this account pliny and all the rest of the ancients agree and as they had frequent opportunities of knowing the truth we are not lightly to contradict their testimony  at present however they are not seen of such amazing dimensions we are told by laet that on the isle of cuba they grow to such a size as that five men can stand on the back of one of them together and what is more surprising still that the animal does not seem overloaded but will go off with them upon its back with a slow steady motion toward the sea  they are found in the greatest numbers on the island of ascension where for several years they were taken to be salted to feed the slaves or for a supply of ships provision their value at present seems to be better known  this animal seldom comes from the sea but to deposit its eggs and now and then to sport in fresh water its chief food is a submarine plant that covers the bottom of several parts of the sea not far from the shore there the turtles are seen when the weather is fair feeding in great numbers like flocks of sheep several fathoms deep upon the verdant carpet below at other times they go to the mouths of rivers as they seem to find gratification in freshwater after some time thus employed they seek their former stations and when done feeding they generally float with their heads above water unless they are alarmed by the approach of hunters or birds of prey in which case they suddenly plunge to the bottom they often seek their provision among the rocks feeding upon moss and seaweed and it is probable will not disdain to prey upon insects and other small animals as they are very fond of flesh when taken and fed for the table  at the time of breeding they are seen to forsake their former haunts and their food and to take sometimes a voyage of nine hundred miles to deposite their eggs on some favorite shore the coasts they always resort to upon these occasions are those that are low flat and sandy for being heavy animals they cannot climb a bold shore nor is any bed so proper as sand to lay their eggs on they couple in march and continue united till may during a great part of which time they are seen locked together and almost incapable of separation the female seems passive and reluctant but the male grasps her with his claws in such a manner that nothing can induce him to quit his hold it would seem that the grasp as in frogs is in some measure convulsive and that the animal is unable to relax its efforts  when the time for laying approaches the female is seen toward the setting of the sun drawing near the shore and looking earnestly about her as if afraid of being discovered when she perceives any person on shore she seeks for another place but if otherwise she lands when it is dark and goes to take a survey of the sand where she designs to lay having marked the spot she goes back without laying for that night to the ocean again but the next night returns to deposite a part of her burden she begins by woking and digging in the sand with her forefeet till she has made a round hole a foot broad and a foot and an half deep just at the place a little above where the water reaches highest this done she lays eighty or ninety eggs at a time each as big as a hens egg and as round as a ball she continues laying about the space of an hour during which time if a cart were driven over her she would not be induced to stir the eggs are covered with a tough white skin like wetted parchment when she has done laying she covers the hole so dexterously that it is no easy matter to find the place and these must be accustomed to the search to make the discovery when the turtle has done laying she returns to the sea and leaves her eggs to be hatched by the heat of the sun at the end of fifteen days she lays about the same number of eggs again and at the end of another fifteen days she repeats the same three times in all using the same precautions every time for their safety  in about twentyfour or twentyfive days after laying the eggs are hatched by the heat of the sun and the young turtles being about as big as quails are seen bursting from the sand as if earthborn and running directly to the sea with instinct only for their guide but to their great misfortune it often happens that their strength being small the surges of the sea for some few days beat them back upon the shore thus exposed they remain a prey to thousands of birds that then haunt the coasts and these stooping down upon them carry off the greatest part and sometimes the whole brood before they have strength sufficient to withstand the waves or dive to the bottom helbigius informs us that they have still another enemy to fear which is no other than the parent that produced them that waits for their arrival at the edge of the deep and devours as many as she can this circumstance however demands further confirmation though nothing is more certain than that the crocodile acts in the same unnatural manner  when the turtles have done laying they then return to their accustomed places of feeding upon their outset to the shore where they breed they are always found fat and healthy but upon their return they are weak lean and unfit to be eaten they are seldom therefore molested upon their retreat but the great art is to seize them when arrived or to intercept their arrival in these uninhabited islands to which the green turtle chiefly resorts the men that go to take them land about nightfall and without making any noise for those animals though without any external opening of the ear hear very distinctly there being an auditory conduit that opens into the mouth lie close while they see the female turtle coming on shore they let her proceed to her greatest distance from the sea and then when she is most busily employed in scratching a hole in the sand they sally out and surprise her their manner is to turn her upon her back which utterly incapacitates her from moving and yet as the creature is very strong and struggles very hard two men find it no easy matter to lay her over when thus secured they go to the next and in this manner in less than three hours they have been known to turn forty or fifty turtles each of which weighs from an hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds labat assures us that when the animal is in this helpless situation it is heard to sigh very heavily and even to shed tears  at present from the great appetite that man has discovered for this animal they are not only thinned in their numbers but are also grown much more shy there are several other ways therefore contrived for taking them one is to seize them when coupled together at the breeding season when they are very easily approached and as easily seen for these animals though capable of living for some time under water yet rise every eight or ten minutes to breathe as soon as they are thus perceived two or three people draw near them in a canoe and slip a nooze either round their necks or one of their feet if they have no line they lay hold of them by the neck where they have no shell with their hands only and by this means they usually catch them both together but sometimes the female escapes being more shy than the male  another way of taking them is by the harpoon either when they are playing on the surface of the water or feeding on the bottom when the harpoon is skilfully darted it sticks fast in the shell of the back the wood then disengages from the iron and the line is long enough for the animal to take its range for if the harpooner should attempt at once to draw the animal into his boat till it is weakened by its own struggling it would probably get free thus the turtle struggles hard to get loose but all in vain for they take care the line fastened to the harpoon shall be strong enough to hold it  there is yet another way which though seemingly awkward is said to be attended with very great success a good diver places himself at the head of the boat and when the turtles are observed which they sometimes are in great numbers asleep on the surface he immediately quits the vessel at about fifty yards distance and keeping still under water directs his passage to where the turtle was seen and coming up beneath seizes it by the tail the animal awaking struggles to get free and by this both are kept at the surface until the boat arrives to take them in  end of the sixth volume
