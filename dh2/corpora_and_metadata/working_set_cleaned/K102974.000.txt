the second act and never afterward mentioned and acamas is a mute indeed the whole conduct of this play is so entirely different from that of the greek poet that the author is hardly conscious to himself of having borrowed any thing more from him than the general idea of the suppliants taking refuge in the temple and macarias voluntary offer of her own life  prologue written by a friend with countenance thrice changed from red to pale our author sends me forth to tell his tale croesus said he  who ruled those lands that lie  croesus  the nabob of antiquity when satiated with war with

a rock will wreck us demophon is jealous of him on that jealousy i will strike a dangerous superstitious spark soon to flame forth at junos temple now he makes a holy halt the interims mine here with old thestor wherefore loiters thus the reverend dreamer whose high sanctity the magic power of gold must move to murder enter thestor oh art thou come at length my ancient friend ancient but ah how unimpaired by age time that digs deep his furrows on most brows only gives comlier grace to thestors years adds reverence to the hairs it silvers over well we are once more met my kings concerns call us in haste together they are weighty nice urgent full of dexterous enterprise and ask thy secret sudden aid  these if they aught of religious import bear as what but sacred purposes claim thestors counsel impart them to the servant of the god whose conscientious mind   alcan i know it well well as i know thy zeal thy friendly zeal proved often in times long past which now alcander means to prove home again nearer good thestor thou see yon shrine thou know what fugitives its sanctuary shelters and the hate the mortal hate eurystheus bears their race but chiefly bears macaria from whose loins another race more hateful may come forth can thou not then  why do thy fearful eyes so cautiously shun mine  can thou not then call down a voice oracular from heaven that claims a victim  that macaria claims i know thou can and far be it from alcander to question his friends will  these is this thy friendship the token this of thy high veneration for thestors character whose heart long since from this vain world estranged   alcan old man  but yet calmly i will commune with thee i will convince thy scrupulous spirit that her single death will save the lives of thousands which a war with argos must devote  these the lives of thousands lie on their consciences who wage the war shall thestors hands be stained with guiltless blood shall thestors tongue belie the temples god with a false oracle his thunders brave  the engendering storm already  alcan these nice qualms these conscientious horrors were they wont to stagger thestor  wants the seer more warrant to be oracular go then consult the entrails of your beasts your babbling birds and groaning oaks or single forth some goat yeaned at full moon and kill him with a knife of that be sure exactly shaped and sized this shall disarm your god of his red bolt and make your murders holy  these such loud passion affronting to the god   alcan are you not all priestess and priest alike the supple slaves of interest whence your tripods and your crowns statues of gold and silver glittering gems that sanctify your shrines whence this vast splendor and what but the rich bribes of crafty knaves and superstitious cowards  one word more of hypocritic mummery and by heaven i will unfold such scenes   these ungenerous man whose headlong phrenzy on my least demur unmindful of all forms all ceremonies of all past benefits temple and priest would overturn   alcan why then the infirmity of thy friends temper urge to the extreme upon a point so trying  these hah and is the point to me less trying  grant it just and sad necessity makes most things just yet to pronounce a sacrifice at once  shed without hesitation royal blood  no reverence had to my own fame no care for my own life and every worldly hope   alcan thy fame thy life if there be confidence in a kings word in friendship like alcanders shall be secure thy every worldly hope to the minutest scruple warranted  and now how softened seems that countenance which speaks without a tongue my friends assent speaks him again my ancient honored thestor here then behold the instructions take them read them and with them take this pledge eurystheus sends it this gem from his own finger now dispatch pronounce the oracle be firm and prosper exit thestor now fate begins its work  i have already alarmed the timorous temper of the king about these fugitives  but he approaches here to perform a superstitious vow he made before his march to marathon  enter demophon and his train demo how venerable the horror that enfolds joves holy temple with profoundest awe behold thy servant enters  alcan may its god inspire thy righteous spirit so to act as best becomes his servant this remember the hand the chastening hand of heaven lies on these exiles and each shrine save this oh king against them shut as against things unholy how desperate then to risk for them a war  demo thy doubts already have found entrance here therefore to know heavens purpose i have sent the most inspired of all the oracular priests our ancient thestor without whose sage voice in holy things we move not  alcan to his voice as is most fit i bow me yet hear further what never oracle more truly spoke your brothers dangerous spirit every hour more dangerous by macarias matchless charms  forgive my forward friendship  but behold graced with the royal ensigns where he comes exulting on in burnished armor clad as he were athens king and peace and war hung on his nod  i must not stay to cross the armys idol exit enter acamas aca back to athens welcome my royal brother  demo when we went from athens in peaceful garb was acamas arrayed the soldiers falchion now invests his thigh the sun now glitters on his polished helm and clanking arms and armor sound to war  aca and if war ever was just and heaven approved it is now when deianira and macaria by a vile tyrant exiled suppliants come to thee and to the god whom thy religion does venerate in that shrine which scarce protects them from the brute outrage of a haughty herald i heard macaria plead and tears burst forth alcander spoke and at each ruffian word my indignation burned to hesitate in such a cause were guilt  demo thy passion speaks this the glittering glory of rash enterprise fires thy transported spirit that would flame the meteor of a multitudes amaze no thought beyond the present hour unmindful of a kings duty that the royal sword should save not sacrifice a peoples lives and then be sheathed when it has fixed the base of future happiness that each exploit weighed and digested deep must be consigned in historys long roll to times unborn and stand their rigid test  aca such then such is the occasion this important hour presents stamp this exploit in historys long roll to stand the rigid test of times unborn rouse then at once insulted virtue cries rouse and revenge  the troops are marshalled  i will march my veterans  demo heedless of the event by heavenly admonition unassured what would thy frantic fury  aca it would hurl yon ruthless ruffian headlong from the throne of argos and restore its rightful heirs restore alcides royal race  in the presence of joves dreadful sanctuary i have given my word irrevocable  demo to embroil my kingdom in civil factions well as foreign war art thou to learn what spirits there are stirring by their own vices ruined bold seditious desperate of what may happen without hope but from the general wreck  these are at work all ready like the pentup pestilence to burst upon us  aca oh ignoble fear bane of all worth which every sacred tie the splendour of the athenian name its glory would basely trample down shall then this state famed for its love of freedom through the world and love of mercy  hah shall generous athens crouch to eurystheus to an argian tyrant its royal suppliants yield  my brother no they shall not quit the temple  demo shall not quit  presumest thou with these fantastic flights romantic visions of a lovesick boy to fright us to compliance  aca lovesick boy   demo that was my word  macaria does the name flush with a crimson shame thy conscious cheek the loves that revel in macarias eyes these are the orators that plead for war and these the generous virtues that would risk a kingdoms ruin  aca well macaria then sounds the alarm for war her filial sighs the wrongs of weeping beauty that might move the world to arms move me  i own the charge i triumph in the weakness  check thy scorn cast on thy slave not me that menacing frown proud king for i will speak when justice bids though death his dart shook at me  with these suppliants my honor is at stake dear as that honor i hold and will protect them though alcander had every wile of every fiend  remember for by the soul of my dread sire the sword to them shall pass through me  enter macaria mac did i not hear a voice like that of acamas or was it my fancys coinage  hah  demo what sudden blaze of beauty breaks upon me from the temple by heaven it is she the siren that seduced my brother and no wonder for her eyes have witchcraft in them and each lovely look a melancholy grace that melts the soul  art thou macaria  mac the distressed macaria daughter of deianira and with her hither from argos by eurystheus driven where acamas  may heaven reward his virtue saw and supported us can thou inform me of my protector  demo hence this moment lady my brother went  mac and art thou demophon his brother whom we owe a life of thanks oh sir to him to you with gratitude as low as to our guardian gods we bend for our late blessing like a cheerful morn fair opening on a dark and dismal night the gracious tidings came they lifted up the lamp of life just fading in her eye and gave to a despairing daughters heart a happy mother  demo in this changeful scene no mortal creature till the hour of fate may be called happy  mac yet might i entreat you to cast one casual glance  admire the work of your own goodness  heavens  how changed from her who lately on the ground on the cold ground lay hopeless almost liseless  with the sight of her good genius bless her  demo much macaria i fear oerrates the indulgence demophon

pause ye my reverend brethren let no thought illomend look or word this place profane with solemn silence all ye priests of heaven attend brief are the words and terrible of the dread oracle  mac what oracle  these no interruption maid at thy command oh king did we proclaim a sacrifice wrapped in celestial musings then approached these reverend sages and with solemn voice chaunted their holiest hymn the shrines burnt bright with sacred fires and every altar sent its swelling incense on a hallowed cloud to him on high  mac this dreadful preparation   these when thus burst forth the awful voice  no steer no blood of bulls will now propitiate heaven to grant success would athens stand secure  would hyllus save his royal fathers throne and his own life  the blood of deianira   mac horror

live i yet survive the dreadful sounds still thunder in my ears  my mothers blood tell me tremendous god what unknown crime provokes such vengeance why is it decreed that the whole race of hercules must feel thy horrible displeasure  these ah presume not rash virgin heavenly wisdom to arraign just is the god though terrible his will must be obeyed but that thy soul would sink at the tremendous sounds should thou hear all  for yet the oracles but half declared   mac but half declared   these the blood of deianira must in a purple stream of sacrifice float on the sacred altar of the god unless with free and voluntary choice alcides daughter here devotes her own  mac thanks gracious powers thanks from her inmost soul that daughter offers  let her brother reign spare her loved mothers life and lo macaria with tears of transport here devotes her own lead to the altar crown with garlands crown your victim and be conquerors  demo what is this that pleads for her so plaintively a pity that is almost painful wherefore in the bloom of youth should such unblemished virtue die  ponder a moment  mac interrupt not sir the solemn offering which for worlds i would not should now be frustrate holy men proceed for me death has no terrors i conjure you ye delegates of heaven obey heavens voice lead to the altar i implore to die  demo it must not be   these heavens voice has spoke
