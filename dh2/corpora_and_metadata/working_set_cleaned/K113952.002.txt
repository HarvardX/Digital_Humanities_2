drink no such liquor as this deity a poem by the late mr samuel boyse from earths low prospects and deceitful aims from wealths allurements and ambitions dreams the lovers raptures and the heros views all the false joys mistaken man pursues the schemes of science the delights of wine or the more pleasing follies of the nine recall fond bard thy long enchanted sight deluded with the visionary light a nobler theme demands thy sacred song a theme beyond or mans or angels tongue a theme that should the noblest warmth impart to animate the soul and warm the heart but oh alas unhallowed and profane how shall thou dare to raise the heavenly strain do thou who from the altars living fire isaiahs tuneful lips did once inspire come to my aid celestial spirit come from my dark mind dispel the dubious gloom my passions still my purer breast inflame to sing that god from whom existence came till heaven and nature in the concert join and own the author of their birth divine i eternity whence sprung this glorious frame or whence arose the various forms the universe compose from what almighty cause what mystic springs shall we derive the origin of things sing heavenly guide whose allefficient light drew dawning planets from the womb of night since reason by thy sacred dictates taught adores a power beyond the reach of thought first cause of causes sire supreme of birth sole light of heaven acknowledged life of earth whose word from nothing called this beauteous whole this wideexpanded all from pole to pole who shall prescribe the boundary to thee or fix the era of eternity should we deceived by errors skeptic glass admit the thought absurd  that nothing was thence would this wild this false conclusion flow that nothing raised this beauteous all below when from disclosing darkness splendour breaks associate atoms move and matter speaks when nonexistence bursts its close disguise how blind are mortals  not to own the skies if one vast void eternal held its place whence started time or whence expanded space what gave the slumbering mass to feel a change or bid consenting worlds harmonious range could nothing link the universal chain no it is impossible absurd and vain here reason its eternal author finds the whole who regulates unites and binds enlivens matter and produces minds inactive chaos sleeps in dull repose nor knowledge thence nor free volition flows a nobler source those powers etherial show by which we think design reflect and know these from a cause superior date their rise  abstract in essence from material ties an origin immortal as supreme from whose pure day celestial rays they came in whom all possible perfections shine eternal selfexistent and divine from this great spring of uncreated might this allresplendent orb of vital light whence all created beings take their rise which beautify the earth or paint the skies profuselywide the boundless blessings flow which heaven enrich and gladden worlds below which are no less when properly defined than emanations of the eternal mind hence triumphs truth beyond objection clear let unbelief attend and shrink with fear that what for ever was  must surely be beyond commencement and from period free drawn from himself his native excellence his date eternal and his space immense and all of whom that man can comprehend is that he never begun nor ever shall end in him from whom existence boundless flows let humble faith its sacred trust repose assured on his eternity depend  eternal father and eternal friend within that mystic circle safety seek no time can weaken and no force can break and lost in adoration breathe his praise high rock of ages ancient sire of days ii unity thus recognized the spring of life and thought eternal selfderivd and unbegot approach celestial muse the empyreal throne and awfully adore the exalted one in nature pure in place supremely free and happy in essential unity blessed in himself had from his forming hand no creatures sprung to hail his wide command blessed had the sacred fountain never run over a boundless sea of bliss that knows no shore nor sense can two bright origins conceive nor reason two eternal gods believe could the wild manichaean own that guide the good would triumph and the ill subside again would vanquished arimanius bleed and darkness from prevailing light recede in different individuals we find an evident disparity of mind hence ductile thought a thousand changes gains and actions vary as the will ordains but should two beings equally supreme divided power and parted empire claim how soon would universal order cease how soon would discord harmony displace eternal schemes maintain eternal fight nor yield supported by eternal might where each would uncontrold his aim pursue the links dissever or the chain renew matter from motion cross impressions take as served each power his rivals power to break while neutral chaos from his deep recess would view the neverending strife increase and bless the contest which secured his peace or new creations would opposing rise with elemental war to blot the skies and round wild uproar and confusion hurled would veil the heavens and waste the ruined world two independent causes to admit destroys religion and debases wit the first by such an anarchy undone the last acknowledges its source but one as from the main the mountain rills are drawn that wind irriguous through the flowery lawn so mindful of their spring one course they keep exploring till they find their native deep exalted power invisible supreme thou sovereign sole unutterable name as round thy throne thy flaming seraphs stand and as they touch the lyre with trembling hand too weak thy pure effulgence to behold with their rich plumes their dazzled eyes infold transported with the ardors of thy praise the holy holy holy anthem raise to them responsive let creation sing thee indivisible eternal king iii spirituality o say celestial muse whose purer birth disdains the low material ties of earth by what bright images shall be defined the mystic nature of the eternal mind or how shall thought the dazzling height explore where all that reason can  is to adore that gods an immaterial essence pure whom figure cannot describe nor parts immure incapable of passions impulse fear in good preeminent in truth severe unmixed his nature and sublimed his powers from all the gross allay which tempers ours in whose clear eye the bright angelic train appear suffusd with imperfections stain impervious to the mans  or seraphs eye beyond the ken of each exalted high him would in vain material semblance feign or figured shrines the boundless god contain object of faith  he shuns the view of sense lost in the blaze of sightless excellence most perfect most intelligent most wise in whom the sanctity of pureness lies in whose adjusting mind the whole is wrought whose form is spirit and whose essence thought are truths inscribed by wisdoms brightest ray in characters that gild the face of day reason confessed however we may dispute fixed boundary discovers man from brute but dim to us exerts its fainter ray depressed in matter and allied to clay in forms superior kindles less confined whose dress is ether and whose substance mind yet all from him supreme of causes flow to him their powers and their existence owe from the bright cherub of the noblest birth to the poor reasoning glowworm placed on earth from matter then to spirit still ascend through spirit still refining higher tend pursue on knowledge bent the pathless road pierce through infinitude in quest of god still from thy search the center still shall fly approaching still  thou never shall come nigh so its bright orb the aspiring flame would join but the vast distance mocks the fond design if he almighty whose decree is fate could to display his power subvert his state bid from his plastic hand a greater rise produce a master and resign his skies impart his incommunicable flame the mystic number of the eternal name then might revolting reasons feeble ray aspire to question gods allperfect day vain task the clay in the directing hand the reason of its form might so demand as man presume to question his dispose from whom the power he thus abuses flows here point fair muse the worship god requires the soul inflamed with chaste and holy fires where love celestial warms the happy breast where from sincerity the thoughts expressed where genuine piety and truth refined reconsecrate the temple of the mind with grateful flames the living altars glow and god descends to visit man below iv omnipresence through the unmeasurable tracts of space go muse divine and present godhead trace see where by place uncircumscribd as time he reigns extended and he shines sublime should thou above the heaven of heavens ascend could thou below the depth of depths descend could thy fond flight beyond the starry sphere the radiant mornings lucid pinions bear there should his brighter presence shine confessed there his almighty arm thy course arrest could thou the thickest veil of night assume or think to hide thee in the central gloom yet there all patient to his piercing sight darkness itself would kindle into light not the black mansions of the silent grave nor darker hell from his perception save what power alas thy footsteps can convey beyond the reach of omnipresent day in his wide grasp and comprehensive eye immediate worlds on worlds unnumberd lie systems enclosed in his idea roll whose allinforming mind directs the whole lodged in his view their certain ways they know placed in that sight from whence can nothing go on earth his footstool fixed in heaven his seat enthroned he dictates  and his word is fate nor want his shining images below in streams that murmur or in winds that blow his spirit broods along the boundless flood smiles in the plain and whispers in the wood warms in the genial suns enlivening ray breathes in the air and beautifies the day steals on our footsteps wheresoeer we go and yields the purest joys we taste below should man his great immensity deny man might as well usurp the vacant sky for were he limited in date or view thence were his attributes imperfect too his knowledge power his goodness all confined and lost the notion of a ruling mind feeble the trust and comfortless the sense of a defective partial providence boldly might then his arm injustice brave or innocence in vain his mercy crave dejected virtue lift its hopeless eye and deep distress pour out the heartless sigh an absent god no abler to defend protect or punish than an absent friend distant alike our wants or griefs to know to ease the anguish or prevent the blow if he supreme director were not near vain were our hope and empty were our fear unpunished vice would over the world prevail and unrewarded virtue toil  to fail the moral world a second chaos turn and nature for her great supporter mourn even the weak embryo ere to life it breaks from his high power its slender texture takes while in his book the various parts enrolled increasing own eternal wisdoms mould nor views he only the material whole but pierces thought and penetrates the soul ere from the lips the vocal accents part or the faint purpose dawns within the heart his steady eye the mental birth perceives ere yet to us the new idea lives knows what we say  ere yet the words proceed and ere we form the intention marks the deed but conscience fair vicegerentlight within asserts its author and restores the scene points out the beauty of the governed plan  and vindicates the ways of god to man then sacred muse by the vast prospect fired from heaven descended as by heaven inspired his allenlightening omnipresence own whence first thou feelst thy dwindling presence known his wide omniscience justly grateful sing whence thy weak science prunes its callow wing and bless the eternal allinforming soul whose sight pervades whose knowledge fills the whole v immutability as the eternal and omniscient mind by laws not limited nor bounds confined is always independent always free hence shines confessed immutability change whether the spontaneous child of will or birth of force  is imperfection still but he allperfect in himself contains power selfderivd for from himself he reigns if altered by constraint we could suppose that god his fixed stability should lose how startles reason at a thought so strange what power can force omnipotence to change if from his own divine productive thought were the yet stranger alteration wrought could excellence supreme new rays acquire or strong perfection raise its glories higher absurd  his high meridian brightness glows never decreases never overflows knows no addition yields to no decay the sacred blaze of inexhaustless day below through different forms does matter range and life subsists from elemental change liquids condensing shapes terrestrial wear earth mounts in fire and fire dissolves in air while we enquiring phantoms of a day inconstant as the shadows we survey with them along times rapid current pass and haste to mingle with the parent mass but thou eternal lord of life divine in youth immortal shall for ever shine no change shall darken thy exalted name from everlasting ages still the same if god like man his purpose could renew his laws could vary or his plans undo desponding faith would droop its cheerless wing religion deaden to a lifeless thing where could we rational repose our trust but in a power immutable as just how judge of revelations force divine if truth unerring gave not the design where as in natures fair according plan all smiles benevolent and good to man placed in this narrow clouded spot below darkly we see around and darkly know religion lends the salutary beam that guides our reason through the dubious gleam till sounds the hour  when he who rules the skies shall bid the curtain of omniscience rise shall dissipate the mists that veil our sight and show his creatures  all his ways are right then when astonished nature feels its fate and fettered time shall know its latest date when earth shall in the mighty blaze expire heaven melt with heat and worlds dissolve in fire the universal system shrink away and ceasing orbs confess the almighty sway immortal he amidst the wreck secure shall sit exalted permanently pure as in the sacred bush shall shine the same and from the ruin raise a fairer frame vi omnipotence far hence ye visionary charming maids ye fancied nymphs that haunt the grecian shades your birth who from conceiving fiction drew your selves producing phantoms as untrue but come superior muse divinely bright daughter of heaven whose offspring still are light o condescend celestial sacred guest to purge my sight and consecrate my breast while i presume omnipotence to trace and sing that power who peopled boundless space thou present were when forth the almighty rode while chaos trembled at the voice of god thou saw when over the immense his line he drew when nothing from his word existence knew his word that waked to life the vast profound while conscious light was kindled at the sound creation fair surpised the angelic eyes and sovereign wisdom saw that all was wise him sole almighty natures book displays distinct the page and legible the rays let the wild skeptic his attention throw to the broad horizon or earth below he finds thy soft impression touch his breast he feels the god  and owns him unconfessd should the stray pilgrim tired of sands and skies in lybias waste behold a palace rise would he believe the charm from atoms wrought go atheist hence and mend thy juster thought what hand almighty architect but thine could give the model of this vast design what hand but thine adjust the amazing whole and bid consenting systems beauteous roll what hand but thine supply the solar light for ever wasting yet for ever bright what hand but thine the azure unequal spread what hand but thine trace out the oceans bed to the vast main the sandy barrier throw and with that feeble curb restrain the foe what hand but thine the wintry flood assuage or stop the tempest in its wildest rage thee infinite what finite can explore imagination sinks beneath thy power thee could the ablest of thy creatures know lost were thy unity for he were thou yet present to all sense thy power remains revealed in nature natures author reigns in vain would error from conviction fly thou every where art present to the eye the sense how stupid and the sight how blind that fails this universal truth to find go  all the sightless realms of space survey returning trace the planetary way the sun that in his central glory shines while every planet round his orb inclines then at our intermediate globe repose and view yon lunar satellite that glows or cast along the azure vault thy eye when golden day enlightens all the sky around behold earths variegated scene the mingling prospects and the flowery green the mountains brow the long extended wood or the rude rock that threatens over the flood and say are these the wild effects of chance oh strange effect of reasoning ignorance nor power alone confessed in grandeur lies the glittering planet or the painted skies equal the elephants or emmets dress the wisdom of omnipotence confess equal the cumbrous whales enormous mass with the small insect in the crowded grass the mite that gambols in its acid sea in shape a porpus though a speck to thee even the blue down the purple plum surrounds a living world thy failing sight confounds to him a peopled habitation shows where millions taste the bounty god bestows great lord of life whose allcontrouling might through wide creation beams divinely bright nor only does thy power in forming shine but to annihilate dread king is thine should thou withdraw thy stillsupporting hand how languid nature would astonished stand thy frown nights ancient empire would restore and raise a blank  where systems smiled before see in corruption allsurprizing state how struggling life eludes the stroke of fate shocked at the scene though sense averts its eye nor stops the wondrous process to descry yet juster thought the mystic change pursues and with delight almighty wisdom views the brute the vegetable world surveys sees life subsisting even from lifes decays mark there selftaught the pensile reptile come spin his thin shroud and living build his tomb with conscious care his former pleasures leave and dress him for the business of the grave thence passed the shortlived change renewed he springs admires the skies and tries his painted wings with airy flight the insect roves abroad and scorns the meaner earth he lately trod thee potent let delivered israel praise and to thy name their grateful homage raise thee potent god let egypts land declare which felt thy justice awfully severe how did thy frown benight the shadowed land nature reversed how own thy high command when jarring elements their use forgot and the sun felt thy overcasting blot when earth produced the pestilential brood and the foul stream was crimsoned into blood how deep the horrors of that awful night how strong the terror and how wild the fright when over the land thy sword vindictive past and men and infants breathed at once their last how did thy arm thy favored tribes convey thy light conducting point the amazing way obedient ocean to their march divide the watery wall distinct on either side while through the deep the long procession led and saw the wonders of the oozy bed nor long they marched till blackening in the rear the vengeful tyrant and his host appear plunge down the deep  the waves thy nod obey and whelm the threatening storm beneath the sea nor yet thy power thy chosen train forsook when through arabias sands their way they took by day thy cloud was present to the sight thy fiery pillar led the march by night thy hand amidst the waste their table spread with feathered viands and with heavenly bread when the dry wilderness no streams supplied gushed from the yielding rock the vital tide what limits can omnipotence confine what obstacles restrain thy arm divine since stones and waves their settled laws forego since seas can harden and since rocks can flow on sinais top the muse with ardent wing the triumphs of omnipotence would sing when over its airy brow thy cloud displayed involved the nations in its awful shade when gloomy darkness filled its midmost space and the rock trembled to its rooted base yet there thy majesty divine appeared there shone thy glory and thy voice was heard even in the blaze of that tremendous day idolatry its impious rites could pay oh shame to thought  thy sacred throne invade and brave the bolt that lingered round its head vii wisdom o thou who when the almighty formed this all upheld the scale and weighed each balanced ball and as his hand completed each design numbered the work and fixed the seal divine o wisdom infinite creations soul whose rays diffuse new luster over the whole what tongue shall make thy charms celestial known what hand fair goddess paint thee but thy own what though in natures universal store appear the wonders of almighty power power unattended terror would inspire awed must we gaze and comfortless admire but when fair wisdom joins in the design the beauty of the whole results divine hence life acknowledges its glorious cause and matter owns its great disposers laws hence in a thousand different models wrought now fixed to quiet now allied to thought hence flow the forms and properties of things hence rises harmony and order springs else had the mass a shapeless chaos lay nor ever felt the dawn of wisdoms day see how associate round their central sun their faithful rings the circling planets run still equidistant never yet too near exactly tracing their appointed sphere mark how the moon our flying orb pursues while from the sun her monthly light renews breathes her wide influence on the world below and bids the tides alternate ebb and flow view how in course the constant seasons rise deform the earth or beautify the skies first spring advancing with her flowery train next summers hand that spreads the sylvan scene then autumn with her yellow harvests crowned and trembling winter close the annual round the vegetable tribes observant trace from the tall cedar to the creeping grass the chain of animated beings scale from the small reptile to the enormous whale from the strong eagle stooping from the skies to the low insect that escapes thy eyes and see if see thou can in every frame eternal wisdom shine confessed the same as proper organs to the least assigned as proper means to propagate their kind as just the structure and as wise the plan as in this lord of all  debating man hence reasoning creature thy distinction find nor longer to the ways of heaven be blind wisdom in outward beauty strikes the mind but outward beauty points a charm behind what gives the earth the ambient air or seas the plain the river or the wood to please oh say in whom does beautys self reside the beautifier or the beautified there dwells the godhead in the bright disguise beyond the ken of all created eyes his works our love and our attention steal his works surprising thought the maker veil too weak our sight to pierce the radiant cloud where wisdom shines in all her charms avowed o gracious god omnipotent and wise unerring lord and ruler of the skies all condescending to my feeble heart one beam of thy celestial light impart i seek not sordid wealth or glittering power o grant me wisdom  and i ask no more viii providence as from some level countrys sheltered ground with towns replete with green enclosures bound where the eye kept within the verdant maze but gets a transient vista as it strays the pilgrim to some rising summit tends whence opens all the scene as he ascends so providence the friendly point supplies where all the charms of deity surprise here goodness power and wisdom all unite and dazzling glories whelm the ravished sight almighty cause it is thy preserving care that keeps thy works for ever fresh and fair the sun from thy superior radiance bright eternal sheds his delegated light lends to his sister orb inferior day and paints the silver moons alternate ray thy hand the waste of eating time renews thou shedst the tepid mornings balmy dews when raging winds the blackened deep deform thy spirit rides commissioned in the storm bids at thy will the slackening tempest cease while the calmed ocean smooths its ruffled face when lightnings through the air tremendous fly or the blue plague is loosened to destroy thy hand directs or turns aside the stroke thy word the fatal edict can revoke when subterraneous fires the surface heave and towns are buried in one common grave thou sufferst not the mischief to prevail thy sovereign touch the recent wound can heal to zemblas rocks thou sendst the cheerful gleam over lybias sands thou pourst the cooling stream thy watchful providence over all intends thy works obey their great creators ends and all the ills we feel  or bliss we share are tokens of a heavenly fathers care when man too long the paths of vice pursued thy hand prepared the universal flood gracious to noah gave the timely sign to save a remnant from the wrath divine one shining waste the globe terrestrial lay and the ark heaved along the troubled sea thou badst the deep his ancient bed explore the clouds their watery deluge poured no more the skies were cleared  the mountaintops were seen the dove pacific brought the olive green on ararat the happy patriarch tossed found the recovered world his hopes had lost there his fond eyes reviewed the pleasing scene the earth all verdant and the air serene its precious freight the guardian ark displayed while noah grateful adoration paid beholding in the manytincturd bow the promise of a safer world below when wild ambition reared its impious head and rising babel heaven with pride surveyed thy word the mighty labor could confound and leave the mass to moulder with the ground from the mad toil while social order sprung a peopled world  distinct by many a tongue from thee all human actions take their springs the rise of empires and the fall of kings see the vast theater of time displayed while over the scene succeeding heroes tread with pomp the shining images succeed what leaders triumph and what monarchs bleed perform the parts thy providence assigned their pride their passions to thy ends inclined a while they glitter in the face of day then at thy nod the phantoms pass away no traces left of all the busy scene but that remembrance says  the things have been while learning through the gloom benighted strays and the dim objects vanish as we gaze  but questions doubt whence sickly nature feels breast  the aguefits her face so often reveals  whence earthquakes heave the earths astonished  whence tempests rage or yellow plagues infest  whence draws rank afric her empoisond stores  or liquid fires explosive aetna pours go skeptic mole demand the eternal cause the secret of his allpreserving laws the depths of wisdom infinite explore and ask thy maker  why thou know no more thy errors still in mortal things as great as vain to cavil at the ways of fate to ask why prosperous vice so often succeeds why suffers innocence or virtue bleeds why monsters nature must with blushes own by crimes grow powerful and disgrace a throne why saints and sages marked in every age perish the victims of tyrannic rage why socrates for truth and freedom fell while nero reigned the delegate of hell in vain by reason is the maze pursued of ill triumphant and afflicted good fixed to the hold so might the sailor aim to judge the pilot and the steerage blame as we direct to god what should belong or say that sovereign wisdom governs wrong nor always vice does uncorrected go nor virtue unrewarded pass below often sacred justice lifts her awful head and dooms the tyrant and the usurper dead often providence more friendly than severe arrests the hero in his wild career directs the fever poinard or the ball by which an amnon charles or caesar fall or when the cursed borgias pope alexander vi and his son caesar borgia see mr gordons history brew the cup for merit  bids the monsters drink it up on violence often retorts the cruel spear or fetters cunning in its crafty snare relieves the innocent exalts the just and lays the proud oppressor in the dust but fast as times swift pinions can convey hastens the pomp of that tremendous day when to the view of all created eyes gods high tribunal shall majestic rise when the loud trumpet shall assemble round the dead reviving at the piercing sound where men and angels shall to audit come and millions yet unborn receive their doom then shall fair providence to all displayed appear divinely bright without a shade in light triumphant all her acts be shown and blushing doubt eternal wisdom own mean while thou great intelligence supreme sovereign director of this mighty frame whose watchful hand and allobserving ken fashions the hearts and views the ways of men whether thy hand the plenteous table spread or measure sparingly the daily bread whether or wealth or honors gild the scene or wants deform and wasting anguish stain on thee let truth and virtue firm rely blessed in the care of thy approving eye know that thy providence their constant friend through life shall guard them and in death attend with everlasting arms their cause embrace and crown the paths of piety with peace ix goodness ye seraphs who gods throne encircling still with holy zeal your golden censers fill ye flaming ministers to distant lands who bear obsequious his divine commands ye cherubs who compose the sacred choir attuning to your voice the angelic lyre or ye fair natives of the heavenly plain who once were mortal  now a happy train who spend in peaceful love your joyful hours in blissful meads and amaranthine bowers oh lend one spark of your celestial fire oh deign my glowing bosom to inspire and aid the muses unexperienced wing while goodness theme divine she soars to sing though all thy attributes divinely fair thy full perfection glorious god declare yet if one beams superior to the rest oh let thy goodness fairest be confessed as shines the moon amidst her starry train as breathes the rose amongst the flowery scene as the mild dove her silver plumes displays so sheds thy mercy its distinguished rays this led creator mild thy gracious hand when formless chaos heard thy high command when pleased thine eye thy matchless works reviewed and goodness placid spoke that all was good nor only does in heaven thy goodness shine delighted nature feels its warmth divine the vital suns illuminating beam the silver crescent and the starry gleam as day and night alternate they command proclaim this truth to every distant land see smiling nature with thy treasures fair confess thy bounty and parental care renewed by thee the faithful seasons rise and earth with plenty all her sons supplies the generous lion and the brindled boar as nightly through the forest walks they roar from thee almighty maker seek their prey nor from thy hand unfed depart away to thee for meat the callow ravens cry supported by thy allpreserving eye from thee the feathered natives of the plain or those who range the field or plough the main receive with constant course the appointed food and taste the cup of universal good thy hand thou openst milliond myriads live thou frownst they faint  thou smilst and they revive on virtues acre as on rapines stores see heaven impartial deal the fruitful showers  lifes common blessings all her children share tread the same earth and breathe a general air without distinction boundless blessings fall and goodness like the sun enlightens all oh man degenerate man offend no more go learn of brutes thy maker to adore shall these through every tribe his bounty own of all his works ungrateful thou alone deaf when the tuneful voice of mercy cries and blind when sovereign goodness charms the eyes mark even the wretch his awful name blasphemes his pity spares  his clemency reclaims observe his patience with the guilty strive and bid the criminal repent and live recall the fugitive with gracious eye beseech the obstinate he would not die amazing tenderness  amazing most the soul on whom such mercy should be lost but would thou view the rays of goodness join in one strong point of radiance all divine behold celestial muse yon eastern light to bethlems plain adoring bend thy sight hear the glad message to the shepherds given  good will on earth to man and peace in heaven attend the swains pursue the starry road and hail to earth the savior and the god redemption oh thou beauteous mystic plan thou salutary source of life to man what tongue can speak thy comprehensive grace what thought thy depths unfathomable trace when lost in sin our ruined nature lay when awful justice claimed her righteous pay see the mild savior bend his pitying eye and stop the lightning just prepared to fly o strange effect of unexampled love view him descend the heavenly throne above patient the ills of mortal life endure calm though reviled and innocent though poor uncertain his abode and coarse his food his life one fair continued scene of good for us sustain the wrath to man decreed the victim of eternal justice bleed look to the cross the lord of life is tied they pierce his hands and wound his sacred side see god expires our forfeit to atone while nature trembles at his parting groan advance thou hopeless mortal steeled in guilt behold and if thou can forbear to melt shall jesus die thy freedom to regain and will thou drag the voluntary chain will thou refuse thy kind assent to give when breathless he looks down to bid thee live perverse will thou reject the proffered good bought with his life and streaming in his blood whose virtue can thy deepest crimes efface reheal thy nature and confirm thy peace can all the errors of thy life atone and raise thee from a rebel  to a son o blessed redeemer from thy sacred throne where saints and angels sing thy triumphs won when from the grave thou raised thy glorious head chained to thy car the powers infernal led from that exalted height of bliss supreme look down on those who bear thy sacred name restore their ways inspire them by thy grace thy laws to follow and thy

loose ambitious covetous or vain ye worms of power ye miniond slaves of state the giddy vulgar and the sordid great but come ye purer souls from dross refined the blameless heart and uncorrupted mind let your chaste hands the holy altars raise fresh incense bring and light the glowing blaze your grateful voices aid the muse to sing the spotless justice of the almighty king as only rectitude divine he knows as truth and sanctity his thought compose so these the dictates which the eternal mind to reasonable beings has assigned these has his care on every mind impressed the conscious seals the hand of heaven attest when man perverse for wrong forsakes the right he still attentive keeps the fault in sight demands that strict atonement should be made and claims the forfeit on the offenders head but doubt demands  why man disposed this way  why left the dangerous choice to go astray  if heaven that made him did the fault foresee  thence follows heaven is more to blame than he no  had to good the heart alone inclined what toil what prize had virtue been assigned from obstacles her noblest triumphs flow her spirits languish when she finds no foe man might perhaps have been so happy still happy without the privilege of will and just because his hands were tied from ill o wondrous scheme to mend the almighty plan by sinking all the dignity of man yet turn thine eyes vain skeptic own thy pride and view thy happiness and choice allied see virtue from herself her bliss derive a bliss beyond the power of thrones to give see vice of empire and of wealth possessed pine at the heart and feel herself unblessed and say were yet no farther marks assigned is man ungrateful or is heaven unkind  yes all the woes from heaven permissive fall  the wretch adopts  the wretch improves them all from his wild lust or his oppressive deed rapes battles murders sacrilege proceed his wild ambition thins the peopled earth or from his avarice famine takes her birth had nature given the hero wings to fly his pride would lead him to attempt the sky to angels make the pigmys folly known and draw even pity from the eternal throne yet while on earth triumphant vice prevails celestial justice balances her scales with eye unbiased all the scene surveys with hand impartial every crime she weighs often close pursuing at his trembling heels the man of blood her awful presence feels often from her arm amidst the blaze of state the regal tyrant with success elate is forced to leap the precipice of fate or if the villain pass unpunished here it is but to make the future stroke severe for soon or late eternal justice pays mankind the just desert of all their ways it is in that awful alldisclosing day when high omniscience shall her books display when justice shall present her strict account while conscience shall attest the due amount that all who feel condemned the dreadful rod shall own that righteous are the ways of god oh then while penitence can fate disarm while lingering justice yet withholds its arm while heavenly patience grants the precious time let the lost sinner recollect his crime immediate to the seat of mercy fly nor wait tomorrow  lest tonight he die but tremble all ye sons of blackest birth ye giants that deform the face of earth tremble ye sons of aggravated guilt and ere too late let sorrow learn to melt remorseless murder drop thy hand severe and bathe thy bloody weapon with a tear go lust impure converse with friendly light and quit the mansions of defiling night drop dark hypocrisy thy thin disguise nor think to cheat the notice of the skies unsocial avarice thy grasp forego and bid the useful treasure learn to flow restore injustice the defrauded gain oppression bend to ease the captives chain ere awful justice strike the fatal blow and drive you to the realms of night below but doubt resumes  if justice has decreed  the punishment proportioned to the deed  eternal misery seems too severe  too dread a weight for wretched man to bear  too harsh  that endless torments should repay  the crimes of life  the errors of a day in vain our reason would presumptuous pry gods counsels are beyond conception high in vain would thought his measured justice scan his ways how different from the ways of man too deep for thee his secrets are to know enquire not but more wisely shun the woe warned by his threatenings to his laws attend and learn to make omnipotence thy friend our weaker laws to gain the purposed ends often pass the bounds the lawgiver intends often partial power to serve its own design warps from the text exceeding reasons line strikes biased at the person not the deed and sees the guiltless unprotected bleed but god alone with unimpassiond sight surveys the nice barrier of wrong and right and while subservient as his will ordains obedient nature yields the present means while neither force nor passions guide his views even evil works the purpose he pursues that bitter spring the source of human pain healed by his touch does mineral health contain and dark affliction quits its fearsome shroud at his command and brightens into good thus human justice  far as man can go for private safety strikes the dubious blow but rectitude divine with nobler soul consults each individual in the whole directs the issues of the mortal strife and sees creation struggle into life and you ye happier souls who in his ways observant walk and sing his daily praise ye righteous few whole calm unruffled breasts no fears can darken and no guilt infests to whom his gracious promises extend in whom they center and in whom shall end which blessed on that foundation sure who build shall with eternal justice be fulfilled ye sons of life to whose glad hope is given the bright reversion of approaching heaven with grateful hearts his glorious praise recite whose love from darkness called you out to light so let your piety reflective shine as men may thence confess his truth divine and when this mortal veil as soon it must shall

look at me alarming thought no wonder it is we dread over these uncomfortable vaults to tread where blended lie the aged and the young the rich and poor an undistinguished throng death conquers all and times subduing hand nor tombs nor marblestatues can withstand mark yonder ashes in confusion spread compare earths living tenants with her dead how striking the resemblance yet how just once life and soul informed this mass of dust around these bones now broken and decayed the streams of life in various channels played perhaps that skull so horrible to view was some fair maids ye belles as fair as you these hollow sockets two bright orbs contained where the loves sported and in triumph reigned here glowed the lips there white as parian stone the teeth disposed in beauteous order shone this is lifes goal  no farther can we view beyond it all is wonderful and new o deign some courteous ghost to let us know what we must shortly be and you are now sometimes you warn us of approaching fate why hide the knowledge of your present state with joy behold us tremblingly explore the unknown gulf that you can fear no more the grave has eloquence  its lectures teach in silence louder than divines can preach hear what it says  ye sons of folly hear it speaks to you  o give it then your ear it bids you lay all vanity aside o what a lecture this for human pride the clock strikes twelve  how solemn is the sound hark how the strokes from hollow vaults rebound they bid us hasten to be wise and show how rapid in their course the minutes flow see yonder yew  how high it lifts its head around the gloomy shade their branches spread old and decayed it still retains a grace and adds more solemn horror to the place whose tomb is this it says it is myras tomb plucked from the world in

on his tomb all of hortensio lives around me as i turn my wandering eyes unnumberd graves in awful prospect rise whose stones say only when their owners died if young or aged and to whom allied on others pompous epitaphs are spread in memory of the virtues of the dead vain waste of praise since flattering or sincere the judgmentday alone will make appear how silent is this little spot of ground how melancholy looks each object round here man dissolved in shattered ruin lies so fast asleep  as if no more to rise it is strange to think how these dead bones can live leap into form and with new heat revive or how this trodden earth to life shall wake know its own place its former figure take but whence these fears when the last trumpet sounds through heavens expanse to earths remotest bounds

care i how rich it be were her hands as rich a prize as her hairs or precious eyes if she lay them out to take kisses for goodmanners sake and let every lover skip from her hand unto her lip if she seem not chaste to me what care i how chaste she be no she must be perfect snow in effect as well as show warming but as snowballs do not like fire by burning too but when she by change has got to her

bower which nursed thy thoughtful youth in the pure precepts of athenian truth where first the form of british liberty beamed in full radiance on thy musing eye that form whose mien sublime with equal awe in the same shade unblemished summers saw where once for well she loved the friendly grove which every classic grace had learned to rove her whispers waked sage harrington to feign the blessings of her visionary reign that reign which now no more an empty theme adorns philosophys ideal dream but crowns at last beneath a georges smile in full reality this favored isle ode for the new year mdcclxiii by w whitehead esquire poet laureat at length the imperious lord of war yields to the fates their ebon car and frowning quits his toil dashed from his hand the bleeding spear now deigns a happier form to wear and peaceful turns the soil the insatiate furies of his train revenge and hate and fell disdain with heart of steel and eyes of fire who stain the sword which honor draws who sully virtues sacred cause to stygian depths retire unholy shapes and shadows drear the pallid family of fear and rapine still by shrieks pursued and meagre famines squalid brood close the dire crew  ye eternal gates display your adamantine folds and shut them from the day for lo in yonder pregnant skies on billowy clouds the goddess lies whose presence breathes delight whose power the obsequious seasons own and winter loses half his frown and half her shades the night softsmiling peace whom venus bore when tutored by the enchanting lore of maias blooming son she soothed the synod of the gods drove discord from the blessed abodes and jove resumed his throne the attendant graces gird her round and sportive ease with locks unbound and every muse to leisure born and plenty with her twisted

your influence bid us know from parent worth what virtues flow be to less happy realms resigned the warriors unrelenting rage we ask not kings of herokind the storms and earthquakes of their age to us be nobler blessings given o teach us delegates of heaven what mightier bliss from union springs future subjects future kings shall bless the fair example shown and from our character transcribe their own a people zealous to obey a monarch whose parental sway despises regal art his shield the laws which guard the land his sword each britons eager hand his throne each britons heart the man of sorrow ah what avails the lengthening mead by natures kindest bounty spread along the vale of flowers ah what avails the darkening grove or philomels melodious love that glads the midnight hours for me alas the god of day never glitters on the hawthorn spray nor night her comfort brings i have no pleasure in the rose for me no vernal beauty blows nor philomela sings see how the sturdy peasants stride adown yon hillocks verdant side in cheerful ignorance blessed alike to them the rose or thorn alike arises every morn by gay contentment dressed content fair daughter of the skies or gives spontaneous or denies her choice divinely free she visits often the hamletcot when want and sorrow are the lot of avarice and me but see  or i it fancys dream methought a bright celestial gleam shot sudden through the groves behold behold in loose array euphrosyne more bright than day more mild than paphian doves welcome oh welcome pleasures queen and see along the velvet green the jocund train advance with scattered flowers they fill the air the woodnymphs dewbespangled hair plays in the sportive dance ah baneful grant of angry heaven when to the feeling wretch is given a soul alive to joy joys fly with every hour away and leave the unguarded heart a prey to cares that peace destroy and see with visionary haste too soon the gay delusion past reality remains despair has seized my captive soul and horror drives without control and slackens still the reins ten thousand beauties round me throng what beauties say ye nymphs belong to the distempered soul i see the lawn of hideous dye the towering elm nods misery with groans the waters roll ye gilded roofs palladian domes ye vivid tints of persias looms ye were for misery made  twas thus the man of sorrow spoke his wayward step then pensive took along the unhallowed shade the man of pleasure yes to the sages be it told however great or wise or old  fair pleasures my pursuit for her i breathe the joyful day for her through natures wilds i stray and cull the flowers and fruit sweep sweep the lutes enchanting string and all thy sweets loved luxury bring  to enjoy is to obey the heavenly mandate still prevail and let each unwise wretch bewail the dire neglected day ah graceless wretch to disobey and devious quit the flowery way and slight the gods decree still still ye gods the blessings send if ever my guilty hands offend indeed my heart is free in pleasures ray see nature shine how dull alas at wisdoms shrine  it is folly to be wise collusive term poor vain pretense enjoyment sure is real sense in philosophic eyes i love the carol of the hound enraptured on the living ground in dashing ecstacy i love the awkward coursers stride the courser that has been welltried and with him eager fly and yes i love ye sneering wise  fair honor spurning still at lies as courting liberty still hand in hand great nature goes with joys to honor never foes and all those joys are free and welcome thrice to british land from italys voluptuous strand ye destined men of art breathe on the thrilling meaning sound each grace shall still be faithful found at your admirers heart avert ye gods that curse of fools the pride of theoretic rules that dupery of sense i never refuse the proffered joy with every good  that can annoy  most easily dispense i catch each rapture as it flies each happy loss a gain supplies and boon still follows boon the smile of beauty gilds my day regardless of her frowns i stray  thus through my hours i run but let me not for idle rhyme neglect ungrateful good old time dear watch thou art obeyed  twas thus the man of pleasure spoke his jovial step then careless took to celia  or her maid the bacchanalian ye sordid wretches chained to rules as asses dull and obstinate as mules whose minds never knew one liberal thought back to your sneaking miserable cells where narrowness of thinking dwells with not one social sense of feeling fraught there free from tumult free from strife in silence doze nor snuff the wick of life but slowly let it waste away while cunning prudence plauds the saving scheme nor let its flame so much as seem to cast a glimpse of one eccentric ray give me the man of blither soul whose spirits through an ampler channel roll who spite of methods drowsy plan will plunge alert into a sea of joy and float on active fancys buoy and snatch at fleeting pleasure whilst he can see yonder festive jocund band a nectard goblet gracing every hand mirth opes the storehouse of the soul and on ill nature turns her polished key sullen the demon limps away nor dares exert the function of control thither let me bend in haste and embrace the bottles waist charms anacreontic prove quaffing to the god of love brighter blushes paint his face and he looks a fresher grace when with bacchus he reclines underneath his purple vines how the jolly hunting song emblematic loud and strong on attentions organ dwells and the force of care dispells till the fullvoicd bursting chorus sets the fox and hounds before us sons of sorrow quit your beds seek the path which bacchus treads drown your avaricious notions in the clarets lively potions mind not what the miser says folly it is to earn his praise or his constitution fails or his avarice prevails else he would laugh and drink and be airy tipsy gay as we ww  the adventurer and the treasure a fable by mr charles denis a knight we read though authors clash once sallied forth adventures to explore not as knighterrants did in days of yore with one squire only and no cash our hero so my author sings was taught to lay down this position that men and money were the things on which depends an expedition he therefore took of both it is said and as along he chased for prey to succor dames and giants slay these words upon a rock engraved he read  deep in the earth a treasure lies  hid from the light of day  whoever would gain the glorious prize  through me must hew his way away to work they go with pickaxe and with crow what will not constancy atchieve it softens damsels hearts more hard by far than marble flint or diamonds are though it is what some folks cannot conceive and now the rock is pierced quite through but yet the treasures not the nearer knighterrants pay for things much dearer for lo a precipice appears in view where twas inscribed upon a post  the money lies on the other coast  which no adventurer can obtain  till this gulphs levelled to a plain after much labor and much cost the gulf is filled the plain is crossed twas time the adventures now were ended for all the money was expended but still new obstacles arise a dragon guards the glorious prize which by the knight must be surmounted before the treasure could be counted i will try quoth he what i can do my purse is empty  that is too true but i have all my courage left of that no knight can be bereft when honor calls i am the man he spoke and on the dragon ran to paint each blow and streaminggash from nose and mouth the streams that flash demands the pen that did indite the actions of la manchas knight well say then after many a slash the dragon lay as twas but meet a breathless carcass at his feet not that our hero came off clear the victory cost him very dear and many a wound left many a scar the marks of honor and the effects of war at length the treasures found  they count it over and what do you think was in the purse penny for penny less nor more the very sum it had before and well it was no worse for when contending princes fight for private pique or public right armies are raised the fleets are manned  they combat both by sea and land when after many battles past both tired with blows make peace at last what is it after all each nation gets why  widows taxes woodenlegs and debts the conqueror and the old woman a fable by the same a persian monarch one of those whose great ambition knew no bound some cyrus or darius well suppose in whom no other vice was found if we dare name ambition so for some doubt whether it be vice or no i have not time at present to confute so grant the question rather than dispute this sophi far and wide his conquests spread full thirty crowns or more were pild on his anointed head and yet with ease the weight he bore for twas his great and chief delight to break the yoke his vanquished subjects wore and make their burden light attentive to the voice of the distressed justice and virtue flourished in his reign when from the confines of his vast domain a good old woman who had been oppressed came to the footstool of his throne to have her grievances redressed and thus in piteous tragic tone his majesty addressed  encouraged by your fame i come from far  sir youre our king by right of war  by right of subject i for justice sue  i claim it and you will grant it it is my due  my daughter ravished and my house destroyed  and all by one whom you employed  to act the king in place of you  i doubt not but all this is true the conscious prince replied  but so far off what can i do  to make my people happy is my price  and yet i cannot everywhere reside  the sun which all the world surrounds  shines and enlivens but to certain bounds  the rest are dark and cold  that is argued ill if i may be so bold returned the matron to the sovereign  twas weak to grasp at what you cannot hold  and conquer more than you can govern while over the sea of life we take our trip kings are by heaven commissioned to command captains not owners of the ship it is theirs to steer the people safe to land and when the bark with prudence they convey we row with pleasure and with pride obey peace a fable by the same amongst the gods a contest rose which put olympus in uproar just so it happened once before when on the banks where simois flows as homer sings in times of yore from words their godships came to blows when jupiter aloud exclaimed  where is peace are ye not all ashamed  thus to expose yourselves again  and be the laughing stock of men then sternly looked the heavens around but peace was nowhere to be found  haste mercury thy wings prepare  fly down to earth and seek her there the god his fathers summons quick obeys arrives and first the court surveys  politeness lives among the great  and peace no doubt has there a seat  such complaisance smiles in each face  peace needs must bask in every heart but here the god mistook the case the mask removed twas fraud twas art all ready to receive commands embracing feigning squeezing hands as fair and yet as foul as sin all peace without all war within he next to themis bench his steps inclined not that he thought within the hall amidst the lawyers brawl the heavenborn fair to find he turned his eyes to that tremendous seat where justice sits with awful air in stern majestic state but peace in vain he looked for there not even great hardwick he whose guardian cares protect the orphan from the harpys claws whose heart as well as hand the balance bears can quell the clamorous jarring of the laws for law like janus has a double face and either shows according to the case for as you find it suits you better you take the sense and leave the letter or vice versa with as good pretense the letter take and leave the sense the god was glad to get from hence and to the temples now he goes where far from all the busy cares of life the holy priests should taste repose free from ambition noise and strife but lo instead of harmony divine beneath religions sacred veil twas interest guilt mistaken zeal all side in parties and in sects combine some for their idol others for their shrine and curse and damn and plunge in brothers blood for what perhaps few understood and now joves messenger directs his way to those famed domes close by where isis glides where alma matter bears the sway and all the muses sport and play and little do besides peace might with learning dwell though not with wit but here again the god was bit pride faction jealousy and spite were centred there as in a fort not for each other to support but what is strange to fight hence pamphleteers and daily writers some barefaced liars some backbiters and all the mercenary set that write to live on what they get not that i say there is any shame to write for bread as well as fame but oh beware nor prostitute an art designed to mend and not corrupt the heart now into private life the god descends and first he views the marriage state alas where seldom peace attends for two that love there is ten that hate here husbands nominal there maiden wives who sue for a divorce of course and some who plague each other all their lives relations more or less divided according as by interest guided ungrateful children parents too severe  in short twas discord everywhere  i have made quoth mercury a fine look out  to father jove what message shall i bring so said he turned about and back to heaven prepared to wing when as he cast his eyes around close by a hermits cell he spied the beauteous fugitive with olive crowned and contemplation by her side  oh oh fair maid at last youre found   yes peace replied it is here i dwell  within this hermits tranquil cell for gods as well as men must own whod quiet live must live alone nor happy then unless he find within himself sweet peace of mind mercury and the shades to miss m  by the same charming annetta but that i am forbid fain would i grace these fables with your name but in each praise i sure may echo fame and then youre finely hid yet hold nor let the blushes rise nor anger sparkle in those eyes where love has fixed his throne but wherefore do i pardon ask remember you imposed the task this fable is your own the messenger of jove as twas his post led to the stygian coast four shades departed from this life a maiden fair just going to be married a good man torn from children and from wife a general that never in fight miscarried and to complete the motly crew a poet who had bid the stage adieu alas the virgin shade then cried where is ah where my lover now i am sure with me he would have died had he but known the manner how for when alive on love relying he clasped me to his tender breast and talked of nothing else but dying now i am gone where can he rest if death flies not to his relief it is plain one cannot die of grief and next the married man his piteous tale began ah me said he what sighs are fetched what tears are shed since i am numbered with the dead oh did they but regret me less my loving and beloved wife my children dearer far than life my only sorrow i confess is to reflect on their distress what signifies your petty private smart then spoke the hero with a frown the public feels my loss in every heart and with their tears write my renown each in the general woe assumes a part whilst roubillac employs his art to raise himself and to transmit me down with weak materials said the bard you build your future fame no doubt but bronze is very hard and marble much the same yet marble moulders brass decays there is nothing but the poets lays can fix the heros name had homer never wrote achilles never had been known and as our brother voltaire says marlbro will live in addison when blenheim and the pillars gone i dont presume myself to quote though to be sure most folks must own amongst the best i was of note the god could not forbear to smile to hear their conscious prate and so indulged them for a while each in his fond conceit but being near the infernal gate he waved his wand aloft in air and first bespoke the maiden fair for you sweet shade that think your lover dying already in his arms another is complying and thou poor soul uxorious ghost what have thou to regret or boast thy wife and heirs are gone to law for in thy will was found a flaw intent on nothing but thy store they count recount it over and over and curse thee for not leaving more and you my noble man of might so famed for spoils so great in fight once gone you are of no import another has your place at court much greater far than all that went before you was as one may say like him the hero of a day like you when snatched away his feats and name will be no more you master poet thank the doctors pill that saved you from the public scoff you was a going fast down hill twas high time to leave off all think themselves of more importance far than really what they are we every day experience what we dread forgot when absent as forgot when dead none thought of us before that we had breath and few will be remembered after death except those few who live to fame death and oblivion are the same the connoisseurs a fable by the same to mr hayman poets and painters flock together in fancys flight birds of a feather then tell me hayman brother in apollo that god of whim whom you and i both follow is not our case who paint or write in all respects the same arraigned by ignorance and judged by spite dubious of praise but sure of blame in every other science great or small a jurys called of the same art and knowledge the surgeon is examined at the hall the doctor at the college but those who use the pencil and the pen submit their works to all degrees of men the scriveners clerk the boy who sweeps the shop the squeamish beau the mawkish fop and thousands more beside of equal judgment sense and spirit condemn approve decide and fix the standard of our merit but if my friend will listen to the tale he will find their sentence not without appeal a famous painter one of those whose pencil was to nature true a hogarth you will suppose but i suppose it is you no matter which  one of the two a portrait undertook to draw three sittings over perhaps some more genius as yet is not confined by law it is done the picture is exposed to view friends come to judge as usual in such case what dont you know the face not i indeed do you it is mine replied the man who sat impossible here is neither grace nor air why this is brown and you are fair i never saw a piece so flat besides the mouth is all askew and then such shades and then such light pray wipe it out begin anew for as it stands it is quite a fright our artist pleads his cause in vain  he needs must paint it over again and now they cry out ten times more why this is worse than that before if you would have your portraits take give us resemblances that strike that seem to think and want to speak a rubens titian or vandyke but as for this there is not one feature like the virtuosi gone the painter said i have a thought that is just come in my head to expose these learned friends of yours who under name of connoisseurs of strokes and touches style and manner chatter but be so kind to join with me and you tomorrow morn shall see how much they know about the matter next day the picture was set forth to sight at proper distance and in proper light just as between them twas agreed and now the learned meet to speak their mind but still they cannot the least resemblance find twas not their friend  not him indeed   that is very strange the portrait made reply  why gentlemen it is i myself it is i for in the cloth a hole was cut through which our man his real face had put to give these connoisseurs the lie then are there none whose judgment fix the test with taste and true discernment blessed whose very praise rewards the artists toil o yes no doubt there are sometimes though very rare you will find a chesterfield or meet a boil love elegy nec lacrymis crudelis amor nec gramina rivis nec cytiso saturantur apes nec fronde capellae virg the dewy morn her saffron mantle spreads high over the brow of yonder eastern hill each blooming shrub a roseate fragrance sheds while the brisk skylark sings his carol shrill now where the willows to the rivulet bend that winds its channel through the verdant mead i will over the turf my waining form extend and rest on sedges dank my anxious head not all the sweets that scent the morning air not all the flowers that paint the vernal

chilling frosts of sad despair it is not my delias scorn my delias pride that sinks my hopes in everlasting night no charms to her the lavish gods denied who formed her perfect as they formed her bright but ah the influence of some baneful star which frowned malignant on my hapless birth has to my wishes placed an envious bar superior to the strongest power on earth if crouding myriads armed for deadly war held from my longing eyes my bosoms queen and kept her deep in gloomy caves afar while mountains rose and oceans flowed between i might not force through spears and swords my way i might not reach secure the distant shore yet urged by venus i would provoke the fray or perish bravely in the tumults roar when fell ambition drives us to the plain dismayed by fear the doubting
