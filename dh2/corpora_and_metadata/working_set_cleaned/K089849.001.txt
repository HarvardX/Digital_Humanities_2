you with an address in the usual style of dedicators to a warm and lively imagination such as mr nugents novelty will appear an essential grace in composition and what kind of novelty can at this time of day be introduced in a form of writing which has been indiscriminately hackneyed by the witty the venal and the dull for several centuries i shall therefore have no recourse to exhausted topics nor shall i endeavor to cull from the stores of common place a secondhand garland which would not fail to be offensive to your delicacy however your politeness might induce you to excuse the aukwardness of the attempt i shall leave it sir to the city of bristol to speak aloud of your eminent abilities and to the annals of parliament to display the brilliant share you have had in all public debates without adding the efforts of my feeble voice to echo back your fame in dedicatory panegyric though i persuade myself were i to trouble you with it one degree of novelty might be allowed me i mean sincerity which i take to be a quality totally unknown to the offerers of incense  but it is not the able statesman i am at present to address it is the patronage of the man of genius wit and humor my ambition has prompted me to solicit and i believe every one will agree with me that i could not any where choose a name more justly distinguished for those splendid embellishments than that of mr nugent  i am not insensible that in doing this i may fall under the censure of the witty doctor young when he says as pedlars with some heros head make bold illustrious mark  where pins are to be sold   the truth is i am afraid the fugitive pieces contained in these little volumes will hardly be found worthy of your attention but if they are admitted to lie in any corner of your study i shall congratulate with myself that they have found so honorable a shelter and i shall be ever proud of having seized this opportunity of subscribing myself  sir your most obedient and most devoted humble servant arthur murphy tavistockrow april        advertisement it is observed by lord shaftsbury that every man who publishes a book professes wisdom but the author of the following essays begs leave to make himself an exception to this general rule of the noble writer having had some reason to imagine that the numbers of the graysinn journal during its periodical publication were not unacceptable to the public he determined not to leave them in their scattered condition and has therefore been at some pains to collect them together in as neat a manner as he could and with as many retrenchments additions and corrections as his various avocations would permit he has only to add that with all due resignation he gives up commas and points errors of the press and all those inaccuracies which horace tells us arise from inadvertency or the imbecility of human nature to the small critics and anonymous pamphleteers of whom he has given his opinion in the essay no    he hopes no reasonable exception can be made by the sensible and the candid to his sentiments in general or the occasional frolicks of an assumed character it should be remembered that mr johnsons remark in the rambler is

me quoque parnassi per lubrica culmina raptat laudis amor studium sequar insanabile praedium rusticum it has been remarked by writers whom a desire of adding to the entertainment of the public has incited to portion out their endeavors into periodical essays that the first address in the introductory explanation of their plan has occasioned more vehement corrosions of their nails and more frequent rubbings of the forehead than any other successive composition in like manner as we find men who upon their first admission into a company of strangers betray several awkward movements in their deportment arising from the different ideas of bashfulness and diffidence which agitate their minds until the initial ceremonies are adjusted as i propose to hold a literary intercourse with the public and flatter myself with the hopes of conversing with many hundreds of my countrymen every saturday i cannot issue out my first performance without feeling an extraordinary solicitude for the event and being disconcerted by those alarms and perturbations of spirit which are apt to seize people of sensibility in their tempers when irresistible principles of action have prevailed over their modesty and called them forth into a conspicuous point of view the first impression has always great influence upon mens judgments and the mind will often hastily form associations of ideas which it cannot afterward easily separate on this account i have been a not a little anxious about my first appearance and after much contemplation and deep study i should have been entirely at a loss how to set off had not the example of our parliamentary candidates pointed out a mode of eloquence to which i think proper to adhere on the present occasion as the most persuasive rhetoric i can suggest to myself  to the gentlemen glergy and freeholders of great britain gentlemen as i have had the honor at a meeting of my friends to be put in nomination to represent you and all your vices follies and foibles in a new paper to be published every saturday and entitled the graysinn journal i desire the favor of your votes and interest assuring you that i stall at all times exert my most vigorous endeavors to serve you being a sincere friend to the cause of true wit and humor and a steady assertor of decency virtue and goodmanners with these sentiments i have the honor to be  gentlemen your most obedient and devoted servant charles ranger n b i am of no party whatever     having thus declared my ambition for literary fame i do not expect that all those rival wits who for some time past have been making their court to the public should instantly decline the poll on the contrary i am apprehensive that as it generally happens at elections much scurrility will be discharged upon the present writer and i am no way doubtful but they will proceed to the extremity of disputing my property in parnassus and obliging me to make out my qualification of this however i hope to give sufficient proof in the sequel and whatever animosities may arise i am resolved to pursue my course without going out of the way like the countryman in the fable to crush the grasshoppers that may make a noise around me i shall console myself in that case with a reflection that those nuisances are ever found in the sunshine  sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis virgil in the prosecution of this design the reader is not to expect any scandal any detraction or ill nature ranger being determined not to indulge himself in the mala mentis gaudia as virgil finely calls the gratifications of a malevolent spirit as this paper is commenced to promote useful mirth and good humor it shall never deviate from those principles to secure which in my own temper and to sow their seeds in others i shall here beg leave to say a few words to my friends the critics  it is observed by mr pope in the very sensible pref to his works that both writers and their readers are generally unreasonable in the mutual expectations they have of each other the former fancying the world must approve whatever they produce and the latter imagining that authors are obliged at any rate to please them for my part i should be glad to compound matters with all the critics of the age if they will abate something of their usual severity my demands upon them for fame and reputation shall not be very exorbitant and should they withhold from me that small tribute i hope at least they will allow me to make as much waste paper as the rest of our periodical writers and daily historians  from the latter of these viz our common newspapers i do not perceive what kind of advantage can redound to a rational creature who can neither receive instruction or entertainment by reading that mr such a one an eminent cheesemonger died at his country house when perhaps he is in perfect good health in thames street and if squire rent roll is arrived in town with a grand retinue i apprehend it no way interesting to any man breathing except his tailor his pimp etc as there is however a principle of curiosity inherent in our constitutions i shall make it my business to administer to its gratification by articles of true intelligence annexed to every essay in the research of these i shall spare no pains and i flatter myself they will have a stronger tendency to divert spleen and melancholy than dull letters from the hague and fictitious advices from the swede and tuck by these means i shall be able to variegate this work and render it a paper of entertainment if not of instruction and upon all occasions i shall think it incumbent on me to have some regard to what is commonly called style for notwithstanding the present practice it appears to me that such words should always be chosen as are most strongly and elegantly expressive of the intended idea and they should if i am not mistaken be combined in such an arrangement as will not be offensive to grammar or unintelligible upon perusal to this if some little knowledge of the world can be added i conceive it will be an additional embellishment as from thence may be derived some just exhibitions of human life and some proper animadversions on men and manners in which articles i may venture to affirm the writers abovementioned are very deficient they informing us no one way of the world unless it be that so often inculcated by them leading to mr keiths chapel down clargesstreet and turn on the left hand  henceforth then be it known unto all men whom it may concern that we charles ranger esquire have undertaken and by these presents do undertake the conduct of a paper entitled the graysinn journal which name it is thought proper to give it on account of the authors residence in graysinn we intend that this our paper shall be a general critique on the times and all false appearances in men and books and as we have observed that what dr young calls laughing satire has always been most conducive to the end we propose we are determined to exert some certain powers called wit humor and raillery and we hereby advise our dearly beloved readers to get their risible faculties in order reserving to ourselves more majorum the privilege of being dull by design and it is therefore ordered by these presents that on or before saturday next all offenses shall cease or they who shall be sound delinquent shall be prosecuted according to the laws of honest satire in some subsequent essay or be obliged to take their trial upon indictment in our court of censorial enquiry the proceedings of which shall be faithfully recorded in our true intelligence  given under our hand this   st of october      charles ranger  true intelligence in order to conduct this undertaking with the most extensive variety of

of modesty stealing down the byewalk of life shall blush to find his virtue called into daylight and the concealed hypocrite stand in the pillory of detection amanda shall not coquet it with every

paper to the patronage of the male part of my readers i shall dedicate the present essay to the british fair and as it is principally calculated with a view to their service at the same time that it carries with it a collateral intention of insinuating myself into their favor i must beg to be admitted this morning to their toilets to call off their eyes for a little time from the dearlybeloved mirror to discard betty from her attendance and in short to exclude for one half hour the whole train of dancingmasters manteaumakers staymakers frenchbarbers venders of washes etc  i am aware that the ladies will be alarmed at the thought of being alone with ranger but the reason of my desiring this dismission of so many favorites is because i profess the very same art to which that class of people have always aspired that of heightening the charms of female beauty and as two of a trade can never agree i think it absolutely necessary to meet with no interruption in this important point from the pertness of a chambermaid the servility of tradesmen and the shrugs and brisk interjections of french proficients who will no doubt be greatly astonished to hear that their artificial embellishments though they may serve when they do not luxuariantly wanton into santastic extravagancies to adorn the female form are yet in no way essential as beauty without such auxiliaries may be rendered still more attractive in the eyes of all men of sense  horace whom it is unnecessary to introduce to the acquaintance of the ladies as creech and francis have taken that agreeable office upon themselves was a man of the most finished taste in all circumstances of life and he tells us in the words of my motto that he shall always love his lalage sweetly smiling and sweetly talking which two accomplishments would not have been touched upon by so fine a poet if they did not carry with them some peculiar charm and i am inclined to think that in them consists the whole train of loves artillery  expression has been mentioned by every elegant writer on this subject as the first ingredient in the composition of beauty and certainly the more pleasing the expression is the more energy will be derived from thence upon every charm for this reason the pleasing smile is the best handmaid to an elegant set of features it give numberless graces to every delicacy and diffuses over the whole countenance an emanation of that sweetness of temper which is the native ornament of the fair to this sentiment the witty dr young has subscribed in his universal passion  what is female beauty but an air divine through which the minds allgentle graces shine they like the sun irradiate all between the body charms because the soul is seen this doctrine has not been established without the utmost propriety for surely senseless inanimate matter however symmetry color and other adjuncts may recommend it cannot any way gain upon our affections i have seen many a picture where the face was well turned and the features justly disposed and yet all men of judgment have invariably concurred to pronounce the piece extremely bad because there were no perceptible traces of a thinking power within and if this property is required in the mere imitation of the human face what shall be said when it is deficient in the original when the appearance of a mind which alone can distinguish us from other sublunary existences and which alone can impart real satisfaction and excite the social feelings in an intelligent being seems to be totally absent miss millefont is without the nicest proportion of features and without a glossy bloom of complexion and yet i believe no one ever saw her sitting in a sidebox at a play or dancing at an assembly without feeling love and joy in sprightly tumult about his heart on the other hand formosa has a delicacy of shape and regularity of countenance and still no one of taste will hesitate to pronounce her unamiable and i will venture to assert that she is never toasted but by those whose intellectuals are so poorly stocked with ideas that they never perceive the vacuity in others  the secret quality from which this difference arises has been called by the french a jenescayquoi and the phrase has been adopted in this country but it is serving the purposes of good sense to explode so unmeaning a term for my own part with all due submission to better judgments i declare myself of that sect of speculatists who really believe that women have souls and i am apt to imagine that the operation of this inward agent has no small influence upon the outward frame a poet of eminence has sung the passions in the features are and therefore i should think that those ladies who are ambitious to appear lovely in the eyes of men should sometimes sit to an intellectual mirror in order to see their affections reflected to them by which means they would be enabled to adjust them to harmonize them to keep them in regular order and if i may so say make them sit right in my opinion they should be as assiduous to fashion themselves in this point as to apply the patch to reestablish a disordered lock to recall a straggling hair to settle the tucker or compose the mant since taking care of the movements of the mind is also regulating the features  from this will naturally result the next essential to beauty the manner of talking agreeably than which accomplishment nothing can so much enliven the amiable sex we are pleased to see a beautiful pair of lips in motion when every thing that comes from them administers to the pleasures of conversation the spirits of the fair are awakened by the exercise of their thinking faculties and the eye beams with double luster the tongue confirms what the countenance had before indicated that all within is sprightly cheerful gay spirited and sensible the scene is frequently shifted to our imagination we are delighted to observe the celerity which distinguishes itself in the operations of the female understanding and the quick succession of ideas which they call up amuses with pleasing variety while the beauties of the mind and face mutually exalt each other and we stand convinced of the platonic tenet that good and beautiful are the same  there are three things highly pernicious to the endearments of beauty from which i must absolutely interdict those who are willing to become my pupils the enemies to loveliness which i mean are gaming scandal and politics surer destroyers of every elegance and bloom than a spotted fever or the smallpox as chronical diseases are more fatal to the constitution than a transitory fit of an acute illness  with regard to the first of these corrosives i leave it to the fair votaries of fortune to consider how the winning graces and the attractive smile can irradiate the countenance when the internal is disturbed by anxiety and solicitude which soon transpire into the face and prey upon all their charms besides when the temper is disconcerted politeness and goodmanners are in danger of being neglected and while every one is intent upon the aftergame which is the fashionable term for that clash of tongues frequently heard in one loud din as soon as the deal at whist is out it is not probable that the fair can converse in a manner suitable to the softness and elegance of their sex  scandal always carries with it a dreadful efficacy to ruin a delicate face because it generally springs from envy or malice which are both entirely against my rules for acquiring and preserving beauty as they are inveterate habits the traces of which are apt to wear themselves into the complexion inducing frowns wrinkles roughness and a settled appearance of illnature of all things the most unamiable  politics is also of pernicious influence tending to inflame the ladies with partyrage to cause heats in the face and to occasion those vibrations of the fan bitings of the lips and fidgets on the chair which greatly discompose the whole form on this account i would have my fair readers abstain from parliamentary debates and though the intended naturalizationact has engrossed the thoughts of the whole nation i think it enough for the ladies to have secretly resolved not to marry a jew and without engaging too deeply in the controversy the sparkling crosses which they wear upon their lovely bosoms will be a sufficient indication of their principles and will at once reflect a luster upon the whiteness of their skins and the delicacy of their sentiments  in what has been premised i would have it remembered that i do not mean to recommend a studied simper or a restless exertion of chitchat but i would have both to be a natural effusion from the sources of goodnature and goodsense which i am convinced will be found a better beautifying cream than any cosmetic advertised in our newspapers and therefore instead of lyingin for a new face or using any other artifice my precept to the ladies is be goodhumoured for a complexion and i now give notice that i shall carefully observe in all public places what ladies repair a decayed visage or add new graces to a blooming one by this receipt and that i shall insert an exact list of the same in the articles of news which i shall serve up weekly to regale my customers z  true intelligence register office oct    it is confidently said that several academies will be

have hitherto published were chiefly intended to open a way for the better execution of this undertaking as pioneers are dispatched to clear the country for the main body of an army and in the same light i beg that the present lucubration may be considered i find since the commencement of the graysinn journal that i have been the subject of much conversation in this metropolis the critics it seems are busy in their enquiries after the author does any body know him  has he been long upon town  has he any thing in him  what sort of a man is he  these and many other questions of the same nature are the topics at present and though at first setting out i thought to evade an account of myself having had always a strong antipathy to any thing that might border upon the ridiculous character of an egotist yet such is the prevalence of custom that it is now become a tribute due from every adventurer in this way and therefore i shall wave the resolutions i have taken and will at present gratify the readers curiosity  i am of the sprightly family of the rangers who have made a distinguished figure in this country ever since the reign of charles ii and am a near relation to my namesake in the play whom many of my readers have often admired when personated by mr garrick though i do not at present ascend by ladders of ropes into honest mens houses yet under a few restrictions i still bear some similar habits of his humor my education was at eton where i imbibed my first tincture of letters though to tell the truth i was chiefly remarkable at that place for running out of bounds i scarcely passed over a week without paying a visit to windsor i was delighted in the castle with the bold imagery which the touch of verrios pencil has poured fourth to the eye and to see the canvas every where glowing with mimic life was pleasing to my young imagination  at length with the character of a wild lad that had latin and greek enough i was removed to the university where i maintained the same reputation for five years whatever was the reason of it i never could adopt any partyprinciples and those whom i perceived attached to prejudices of either side have always appeared to me in very ludicrous colors i have known a jacobite drink himself out of his health and fortune for the good of his country and i have seen a very worthy gentleman reduced to necessity by squandering his substance in elections to keep out the pope the devil and the french king i believe there cannot be a more ridiculous character than that of a state quixote who having affairs of moment to himself and his family generously neglects his own concerns to take care of his country which would be in every particular as well without such a patriot  for my part i have no manner of taste for politics the election of the king of the romans does not concern me nor do i trouble myself about the windowlight tax provided the prices at the playhouse are not raised upon us and as to a standing army twenty thousand redcoats shall give me no kind of trouble while they plant no bruisers in the pit to overruled our decisions should any such attempts be made upon the birthright privileges of an englishman i shall then be as warm a patriot as the best of them not even the freedom of both houses shall buy me off and i have now lying by me several essays on history and the british form of government which in that case shall see the light  these are the principles i have contracted with regard to matters of state as to my person i beg leave to be silent on that head as i do not choose to receive any proposals for marriage which i am told have been publicly solicited by a certain daily writer thus much i will hint i am now in the two and thirtieth year of my age and after having taken the tour of europe grays inn is become in shakespeares language the seamark of my utmost sail i have been registered according to the police in paris and like sir harry wildair in

opportunity of collecting materials for these lucubrations and among the number that frequent this place i shall be able sometimes to glean a few characters for the amusement of my readers besides this i belong to a club of originals which meets once in each month at the deviltavern near temple bar every member of it is remarkable for some peculiarity in his manners and way of thinking and this not contracted by an affected imitation of others but absolutely inherent and native to the respective persons i shall take a proper opportunity to bring the town acquainted with this society and perhaps may deduce from their assistance such matter as will not be disagreeable to my reader  i must add to what has been said that i have from nature a very extraordinary talent which as it will be of use hereafter i will here explain i have been remarkable from my infancy for a most surprising skill in physiognomy and have had from my greener years the sharpest discernment into the passions of men from the survey of their countenances this faculty has grown up with me and it is now arrived to that degree of penetration that i can by infallible rules read the thoughts of people when a critic talks of longinus i can often perceive by the cast of his eye that he never looked into him and in all decisions upon style language and authors etc i can discover with a glance the secret springs of action and the latent prejudices lurking in their minds of this more another time as to the news i shall receive frequent contributions from a particular friend who is every way qualified for that

the better conducting this our grays inn journal  resolved that this author shall not be the tool of any party whatever  resolved that he shall not like the gay inspector trifle with his readers over

lucos amaenae ques and aquae subeunt and aurae hor the operations of the human mind are at all times extremely subtle and while we compound vary and associate our ideas into so many different combinations the workings of the soul are not attended to and the traces they leave are so delicate that they are afterward scarcely to be perceived i do not think this phenomenon in the ideal world is at any time so surprising as in those moments when the faculties of bodily sensation are lulled in sleep then the imagination calls forth her abstracted train and being free from the encumbrance of flesh disports herself in the most whimsical manner and is at liberty to form what appearances what scenery what imagery and what reasoning she thinks proper this i experienced in a lively manner the other night and as i cannot help believing that any of my readers would have been glad to enjoy the same visionary scene i shall instead of a formal essay make my dream the subject of this days paper  i retired home to my chambers a few evenings since in a very poetical mood and to gratify the present course of my ideas took into my hand virgils georgies which has always been considered by the critics as the most perfect poem of the most accomplished poet the delicacy of expression and every refined beauty in the turn of the style have been finely treated by the elegant mr addison and for my part i never look into it but i perceive some concealed stroke which had before escaped me but the enthusiasm which animates the following passage struck me the other night in a manner which never happened to me before  me quoque parnassi deserta per ardua dulcis paptat amor juvat ire jugis qua nulla priorum castaliam molli divertitur orbita clivo the fire and rapidity in the first line and the rapture and air of inspiration in the succeeding one must warm any imagination that has but the least spark of fire i could not help dwelling on it with admiration it opened to my mind a train of images which gave me the most exquisite pleasure and made such an impression on my spirits that even in sleep they continued to flow in the same traces they had before been thrown into and thus my waking thoughts were recalled to me with double delight  i thought that of a sudden i was hurried away to the realms of parnassus and that i towered with rapture over the several cliffs which are frequent in those regions the air methought seemed to be clearer than what i have ever met with the skies were brightened into the purest azure the sun darted his genial rays all around and different streaks of light blending themselves in sundry parts of the hemisphere served to diversisy the scene the country smiled in vernal delight covered with the most cheerful green i had ever beheld in one part was displayed to view an ample lawn stretched to such a length that the eye lost itself on the other side presented themselves meads and gardens and laurel groves hills there were whose blue tops grew fine by degrees and lessened to the sight amid the clouds from one of these issued the pierian fountain which divided into several rills came tinkling down the mountain and at the bottom all assembling into one general reservoir they there expanded themselves into a pleasing surface and formed a river which watered all the country round here i fell into that state of mind which is so excellently described in the pleasures of imagination   then the inexpressive strain diffuses its enchantment fancy dreams of sacred fountains and elysian groves and vales of bliss the intellectual power bends from his awful throne a list ning ear and smiles the passions gently soothed away sink to divine repose and love and joy alone are waking love and joy serene as airs that fan the summer i felt the most ardent ambition to gain the summit of the hill but it was in several places so sleep that i believe i should never have reached it if apollo had not been favorable to the humble prayer which i preferred i did not build my supplication upon any merit in the literary world but humbly presumed upon the delight which i always took in works of genius and in apollos eye the next thing to a good author is to have a taste and relish for the beauties of fine writing i was struck with reverential awe at the sight of the god of wit and such melody filled my ears such divine harmony enchanted the place that i instantly fell on my knees and worshipped the nine harmonious maids who caused the heavenly strain they beheld each other with an air of mutual affection and complacence their eyes were bright with meaning and i thought that in delicacy of shape and feature they had a near resemblance to two ladies known to the world by the name of the hibernian beauties  after paying sufficient adoration i withdrew from the presence of the deities and went round the place in order to view the country more particularly the greatest part of these regions is portioned out by apollo into different tenures some of them conveyed to the person for ever others for life and many for a shorter duration there are mansionhouses built on many of these estates and the great geniuss who

prefaces and dedications to the great men of parnassus and mr pope was retired to his own house which was situated on the banks of the river already mentioned and the country adjacent was laid out in the most exquisite taste mr pope was formerly very attentive to the improvement of his land and where the soil did not yield spontaneously he assisted with hotbeds this turn was now quite over with

think it indispensably incumbent on me to take some notice of it i did not imagine before this incident that a cold trifling frothy writer could have drawn so much from me but in the defense of truth justice and good sense i cannot control myself from it and as he has thought proper to record a fact i will in my turn begin with one of as glaring a die as i have ever known  by these presents then be it known unto posterity that in the year one thousand seven hundred and fiftytwo there really did exist a daily author who arrogated to himself the title of inspector general of great britain that under this pompous appellation he took upon him to prescribe fashions to the ladies and wirewigs to the gentlemen intrigue to rakes and taste to pretty fellows that he pestered the town with dissertations on fossils minerals and insects that never existed but in his own imagination and from thence emboldened by a kind of negative applause that of being endured he rose a degree higher and at a time when our theatrical entertainments were under the justest regulation did his endeavors to sow the seeds of discontent in the minds of the audience to soment divisions among them and contrary to all law to raise a riot at the theater royal in deary lane and in a public paper absurdly encouraged them to throw the sconces and benches on the stage  it is hard to imagine to ones self the ideas that will occur to posterity upon perusal of this most extraordinary passage they will i am afraid believe their ancestors at this period relapsing into the ancient  of the first inhabitants of this island i have examined the index to the spectator to the  and guardian for the words riot benches sconces etc and i cannot find any thing of the kind recommended under any of those heads nor do i believe such an outrage to common sense was ever offered in any civilized nation of the known world the authors of the immortal performances just mentioned endeavored to cherish good humor goodnature social harmony and goodmanners theatrical merit in their time was promoted to the greatest elegance every thing that carried with it the least tincture of a vitiated taste was by them attacked with the most masterly strokes and now this essayist would turn the tables upon these approved geniuses and by extinguishing all sparks of emulation destroy the only means of heightening our public entertainments and disabolishing sense and refinement among us  as i generally like to trace things to their source i have been considering what could be the motives that induced his inspectorship to this proceeding and i  i may take upon me to say i have discovered the latent cause this prodigy of genius this florid witty elegant sensible unexhausted inspector owed the first dawnings of his immoderate fame i blush to tell it to a pantomime entertainmnt and shall he whose monsterbreeding brain spawned orpheus and eurydice in whose head hell rises heaven descends and dance on earth gods imps and monsters music rage and mirth a fire a jig a battle and a ball till one wide conflagration swallows all pope shall he look tamely on and see his favorite monsters exposed to ridicule may he not have some wild production still in store such a genius never can have done and hence all that labored impotence of animadversion which he has thrown out in two different papers  but to be a little more serious it is certain that two contending theaters have always indulged themselves in strokes of pleasantry upon each other the impromptu of moliere was a banter upon a rival house in so polite a place as paris and a recent instance will evince that mr rich has no aversion to the practice it is notorious that a few winters since he engaged a person whose abilities consist solely in mimickry publicly to burlesque as far as in him lay mr garrick as a man an actor and a manager he has always given oblique allusions whenever they came in his way and nothing has escaped him from the coronation in harry the fourth down to the ballad in harlequin ranger  and shall not the manager of the other house have leave to amuse the town in his turn it is acknowledged by the writer who has occasioned my taking the pen in hand that the objects are well disposed there is humor in the management of them and there is merit in the song that explains the design of their introduction what is more there is justice for the subject is worthy ridicule in saying this he advances nothing but the truth but when he adds where is the modesty of arraigning the taste of an audience to an audience etc and again it is unjustifiable it is cruel it is not to be supperted in the name of common sense what would he be at first there is merit in it then it is not to be justified there is humor in it then it is not to be supported there is justice in it and the next moment it is cruel for heavens sake mr inspector learn to be a little consistent and dont thus trifle with our understandings  when a man will write in this shuffling manner blowing hot and cold saying and unsaying when an author who pretends to instruct will run off from the point in a snipsnap style with pert question and answer down a whole column of his paper it is not eligible to follow him further therefore let his meandering briskness run what riots it will for the future i shall here state this matter in a proper light and then have done with controversy  nothing in my apprehension shows the temper of this nation more than the ferment their minds are thrown into by little divisions of this nature a real or a mock monarch a minister of state or a manager of a theater must eternally embarrass their thoughts every thing among them must be a partybusiness whereas in my opinion while their liberties remain inviolate they should know no party but a party of pleasure and all differences betwixt tweedledum and tweedledee should be subservient to their merriment the field of humor is open to both play houses and if without animosity they will cull from thence the result must be that the public will receive more entertainment from a spirited emulation than from an inactive state this is the case among the french to this day and those who weep one night at a tragedy of genius are sure to laugh at the same piece the evening following at the italian comedy and if this liberty is taken with the noblest productions of the human mind why so much tenderness for what is really ridiculous and unfit for the stage the dramatis personae exposed to derision on this occasion are if i am not mistaken a lion a bear a cat a dog a monkey a serpent and an ostrich an admirable company of comedians truly but are they such respectable personages as to claim an exemption from the lash of ridicule  ay but poor rich poor rich  if by that pathetic exclamation is meant that he is an object of compassion i own i have always thought him such and do from my heart most sincerely pity him but if through a depravity of taste or debility of mind he has no relish for the sublimer compositions of a theater let not us therefore like egyptians worship serpents dogs and monkeys but on the contrary let us by the assistance of the politer arts efface all traces of barbarism and preserve in all our public exhibitions a manly affection for the cause of dramatic poesy of genius and of shakespeare  true

mr garrick has made an unwarrantable attack upon richs animal comedians one of these choice spirits assured the company that he really believed if this transaction had not deterred the covent garden

brevis pede lumine laesus rem magnam praestas zoile si bonus es martial in a former paper in which i gave some account of myself i was not in jest when i told my readers that from a natural sagacity of sight improved by experience and study i had made a surprising proficiency in the art of physiognomy among my private acquaintance i have acquired such a reputation in this way that i have known many ladies who would no more dare to come into my company than the young romp in swifts vision would venture to stroke the parish lion after she had played at hide and hoop with jackey in the garret notwithstanding this i am sensible the majority of mankind at this day treat this art as a mere exploded imposture like astrology and palmistry imposed upon the credulous in dark and ignorant ages with them a physiognomist and a conjurer meet with the same degree of respect and credit but this objection i believe will quickly vanish when we come to consider the principles and foundation on which the art is established i might here aptly bring in the story of socrates and the physiognomist but it is known to every body besides reason alone and not authority is what i proceed upon  the great and almost incredible wonder of this talent consists in being able to discover the passions virtues and affections even at the very time that they are dormant in the breast so as to point out a knavish citizen at his prayers to know a cutthroat though he smiles or a fellow that has a design upon your fob though he turns his head another way with an affected vacancy of face to mark out a fellow whose mouth is open only to have it stopped with a bribe while he is declaiming against corruption or to detect the niggard hand of a miser in the very act of seeming generosity and munificence yet all this and more may be done and how it may be done i will here in part explain but i must beg to be excused if i do not reveal some secrets of this arcanum  every passion every virtue and their several modes mixtures and combinations which subsist in the human breast have a correspondent set of muscles in the face or if the anatomists will not allow this they at least operate differently upon the same set of muscles which when any affection is master of the temper are thrown into motion and this regularly produces a certain configuration of features which is commonly known to us by the name of expression this the painters and the statuaries can also attest and to this they owe the very soul of their art for by observing the exact shape that each different passion of the mind gives the several muscles of the face and by copying the same upon a lifeless subject it produces that agreeable deception which makes us imagine that this disposition of features is an effect of motion communicated from a thinking mind within when it is only the result of their skill in the art of imitation the good player goes another way to work he excites in himself the inward motions which we call feeling and then the outward effect upon the countenance naturally follows  the anatomists will further inform us that every muscle of the human body collects strength and expands itself into larger dimensions by continual exercise and use as the legs of chairmen and others who are used to carry burdens from the same cause swell to an uncommon thickness it follows then that the correspondent muscles of the face which express any ruling passion of the mind being more frequently exerted grow out of proportion and become conspicuous above the rest hence the face contracts an habitual air marking the features with some peculiar cast of character which is legible at one glance of the eye any body can distinguish a miser a coxcomb a leacher or a glutton in every circumstance of life  i know some wellmeaning people may be shocked at the thoughts of indulging ourselves in the practice of forming opinions of mankind by their looks this proceeds from a charitable consideration that as we make not our own faces we should not be accountable for them but they who think in this way take no care to distinguish the good face the ingenuus vultus of the ancients that which cicero says is the best letter of recommendation a man can carry about him from the handsome the mere formation of inactive features and gloss of complexion the latter is the gift of nature alone and is that which the philosophers of all ages have persuaded us is of no intrinsic value but the former which we understand when we say such a face is not handsome but is extremely agreeable is in every mans power to acquire not by studying to put on a formal simper or smiling complacency before the glass but by rectifying the mind and furnishing it with noble generous and virtuous sentiments which transfuse themselves into our features with an irresistible persuasion commanding by a secret kind of fascination the esteem of every judicious beholder i never knew a stronger instance of this than in the face of a certain nobleman who to a vulgar eye might appear to have an unpleasing assemblage of disproportion and irregularity  i have observed a certain attorney in westminsterhall who i think has one of the handsomest faces i ever saw and yet through the luster of his eye the regularity of his features and bloom of his complexion i could read such a settled habit of the most contracted cunning so many determined purposes of cozenage and fraud that i protest i could not be easy while the fellow stood within armslength of my pockets yet to my astonishment upon inquiry i learned that several great families had entrusted this man with their most important affairs  eugenio is neither happy in a face nor a person and at the time he should have learned to dance was unfortunately employed in forming his mind upon the model of the ancients hence he has contracted an uncouth air a college look and an awkward deportment yet through all these disadvantages and a cloud of uneasy circumstances the judicious eye can discover a soul within capable of displaying the most divine attributes of his god with a sublimity inferior to nothing but the subject  on the other hand cast your eye upon florio florio is a man of gaiety and plausible address and there are some whom he has persuaded to think him one of the prettiest writers of the present age by his dexterity in the art of plagiarism he passes upon the crowd for a man of some learning and i have heard himself say that the ladies think him a man of gallantry and a wit no man is more perfectly satisfied with himself than florio he writes with the utmost facility without any manner of subject and this he thinks is style simplicity and ease upon the whole one might be so far deceived at first sight as to think florio a pretty fellow yet look at his countenance can any thing be more visible than the furniture within a confused assemblage of vanity arrogance cowardice dullness ignorance and conceit florio generally wears a gleam of cheerfulness on his face and yet it is visible that this is all forced and through the false appearance florio has an uneasy disconcerted temper  the mortification in sordidos leg had like to have gone too far before he could prevail upon himself to be at the expense of cutting it off i attended him at the time of the operation which to the surprise of every one he bore with wonderful patience but while others were admiring his amazing resolution i could plainly perceive by his looks that sordidos composure proceeded from the consoling thoughts that he should hereafter save just half his expenses in the article of shoes  i could point out a certain reverend gentleman who wears the most plausible appearance of humility sanctity and grace ask him familiarly how he does and with a solemn thanksgiving voice and the whites of his eyes turned up with pious gratitude to heaven he blesses his god he is very well yet view his shining jolly countenance with the smallest degree of attention and through this gauze of hypocrisy you plainly discover a horrid groupe behind composed of pride gluttony cruelty and lust  yet i will engage he will rise in his profession for he can cringe and flatter with the best  prudissa is regular at her devotions she goes twice a day to church she constantly has her footman to carry her prayer book

to the character she chooses to assume  the unhappy calista through the persidy of the man she once placed her affections upon and some family misfortunes that followed after is now obliged to endure the embraces of one of the most detestable leachers upon earth yet in calistas soul i can read the latent traces of chastity humility and love blended with a tenderness of distress that sometimes flows into her eyes and adds such a melting softness to her native beauty as nothing that is human can avoid being affected with yet to a vulgar eye the unfortunate calista appears no better than the common tribe of prostitutes  not to produce any further instances at present i can see so clearly into the characters and dispositions of mankind that if some folks whose names i could mention do not shortly mend their manners i will take a general tour through the cities of london and westminster and unmask every smoothfaced villain that i meet in the mean time if a certain gentleman who generally wears a laced frock a bagwig and a long sword does not lay aside his project of sacrificing to a set of sharpers with whom he is to go shares the good natured young nobleman who took a liking to him for his honesty i will certainly let his lordship know the whole affair and if a certain lady of distinction who by a side glance last monday in the mall discovered what intimate familiarities had passed the evening before between her and a certain handsome fellow in a red coat does not instantly break off all further commerce with him i must immediately inform her husband for

improvement of her understanding those ideas which she is possessed of are in a constant rotation and she never dwells long upon any subject but is always sure to say something lively upon every thing that offers her ladyship began to rally me with a deal of pleasantry upon my being a public writer when as apollo would have it a loud rap at the door shook the whole house i have often wondered at this strange din with which even though the entry stands wide open our ears are always to be stunned upon these occasions as the company comes to a rout it is possible this may make part of the ceremony and besides the pleasure of alarming a whole neighborhood i suppose the ladies may think that what with the thunder below stairs and the lightning in their eyes they sail into a room with a greater eclat  this was the case with mrs fidget after she had seated herself in her chair twisted her body two or three times to compose herself adjusted the sparkling cross upon her neck and given a

parts of the room and in an inward apartment a bragtable was prepared for those who are fond of that game the thoughts of the whole company began immediately to flow into another channel they who were before happy in a mutual intercourse of social pleasure became of a sudden secret enemies to each other and every one had a design on his neighbors pocket i should think this strange scene would afford many nice touches to the pencil of an hogarth and it would not fail of being highly entertaining to see the different effects of the same passion operating upon a number of people according to their respective tempers and various ideas of winning and losing to mark this with delicacy and to blend the private habits of each different character with it would in my opinion show a nice discernment and be worthy of a masterly hand to execute it  after a rubber or two at whist i detached myself from the party i was joined to in order to take a survey of the room and i could not help wondering how men amid such a prosusion of charms as the ladies displayed could fit so cool and attentive to their game and i observed that the queen of trumps grotesque and unnatural as the figure is was the venus of every gentleman present it is the interest of the ladies not to encourage a gamester for if this should become the ruling passion of the men the labors of the toilet are all in vain in vain may the fair dress themselves in smiles in vain heave the tender breast cards have banished love and so adieu to the female reign  but this is not all if this taste continues not only love but beauty is at stake and the odds are greatly against it while the amiable but delicate sex sit in painful durance at a card table the liquid luster of the eye is extinguished the roses fade upon the cheek and uneasy passions deface the countenance amanda is at present in all the pride of beauty her is stature tall and genteel she boasts a regular and elegant set of features her bloom glowing as the poets fancy a mild radiance beams from her eyes there is such an inexpressible delicacy about her mouth that it is entirely the beuche gracieuse of the french and over her whole countenance is

little wings and a disagreeable expression immediately succeeded i could not bear to hear so exquisite a beauty with a confirmed voice tell a forward young fellow that truly she would not be bullied

days since and as it unfolds some of the follies which are apt to adhere to the ladies i shall beg leave to recommend it to the perusal of my female readers  to charles ranger esquire sir as i perceive that you frequently detach yourself from the more serious business of a public writer in order to mix with the beau monde and that you still retain great attention to the amiable sex as you politely call the ladies i must beg you will permit one of them to break in upon your studies  you must know sir that i have hitherto been of that species of women called coquettes i was initiated into this science in my greener yearr and the whole course of my education conspired with other circumstances against me my mamma took early pains to train me up in this way and the attendants i had about me all joined to infuse the same sentiments into my mind as if they had made a point of it to reader me egregiously ridiculous from a child i promised to make a fine woman as the phrase is my features were regular and i must add did not want delicacy and i had a bloom that greatly enlivened my whole countenance the lesson constantly rung in my ears was that miss should hold up her head  and put forth her chest  and one day or other she would become a celebrated toast and then the men would all be expiring for her  this you may believe was flattering to my fancy and to give the last finishing to my accomplishments for this state of felicity i was put into the hands of a french dancing master  from this gentleman i acquired a thousand nameless arts of affectation and he not only undertook the direction of my carriage in the graceful movement of a minuet and the more sprightly gambols of a countrydance but the management of my features became also part of his concern he let me into the whole secret of the elevated brow the languishing glance and the sleepy eye he instructed me when to display the snowy breast to move with the easy indolent carriage to throw the whole person into a graceful attitude and after observing that it is a thing very rare in these kingdoms taught me the whole use of the hands in every circumstance at cards or conversation though it was not without some pains that i attained the method of taking snuff with a proper air and artful display of the fingers  there are a thousand artifices to make up for the deficiency of chat in company and in all these i became as regular as a piece of clockwork add to this that he recommended to me a great variety of french romances novels and memoirs of ladies of quality and to complete the whole he told me one day with a mighty serious air that i really had an immense share of wit in this notion i was further consirmed by monsieur lojeunesse my haircutter i assure it you madam says he as my hair was receiving the proper adjustment from his finger you have indeed ver much esprit  wherever i go to dress de gentleman it is all dying for you  you have them in chains madam  pon my vord  just as i have dis lock here in my hand  pray hold your head a leetle more aside  and all de ladies envy your eclat i assure it you madam  charmed with these ideas of my person my breast was fired with the love of conquest and the thoughts of being a wit quite intoxicated me it was enough to turn my little head for let me tell you mr ranger wit is the most dangerous thing a woman can think of because it generally ruins the share of understanding heaven has been pleased to bestow upon her i was not content to say or do any thing in the common way and i read rochefoucaults various thoughts in order to retail his brilliant sayings again in company i am sure you would laugh at me were you to see the pains i took to distinguish myself in all places of public diversion i think i remember something in a poet that may help you to an idea of my behavior  she rolls her pretty eyes in spite and looks delightfully with all her might my heart danced within me to hear clarinda in the suspicious husband utter with an air any woman can give ease i disdained so poor an accomplishment and to cause pain and uneasiness was the business of my life to see that the fellows could not be easy with me nor without me was the joy of my soul i read all our modern comedies to glean up the airs of the fine women and i was delighted like lady betty modish to hear a tortured lover bring out yet for the curse of human race this devil has an angels face   whenever i could meet with a man of parts and sense my highest ambition was to ensnare him such a one i had a pride to lead in captivity and in spite of all his boasted reason to play upon his passions gave me the most exquisite pleasure favonius is one of this class he has understanding without affecting it his wit is always tempered with good nature and politeness he is as handsome as most of his sex and there is no requisite in the character of a gentleman but what he is possessed of with these accomplishments he became my professed humble servant and though he made love to me in a manner hardly resistible i delighted in tormenting him if we were at a i lay together i took pleasure in pointing out to him several young fellows whom i pretended to be charmed with one i observed had the finest set of teeth and the prettiest smile in the world another the handsomest forehead and the most delightful eyes a third had a becoming head of hair and abundance of wit and though an underactor perhaps was on the stage i vowed he was a charming man in a countrydance when i perceived his spirits elevated i have sat down of a sudden told him i was tired and immediately after begged of him to let me take one turn wih a frightful horrid creature whom i detested  notwithstanding all this i really was in love with favonius but by my own misconduct he has slipped through my hands the amiable elfrida has won him by her artless attractive beauty elfrida has always formed berself upon a plan very different from mine assability cheerfulness and good humor were the only stratagems she had recourse to and these joined to a fne figure and a lovely face have made her happy in the arms of a man with whom life will be one scene of endearment  this incident mr ranger has opened my eyes and i now perceive that i have been all this time vainly aiming at imaginary triumphs and that all my artifices were like the wars of the french king in flanders serving merely to extend conquests which are afterward not to be ascertained on this account i am now de ermined to divest myself as fast as possible of all my follies and to attach myself for the future to those rules of behavior which i am sensible add new graces to the beauty of our sex to convince you that i am in earnest on this occasion i beg you will annex to this letter

four or five hours the other order seems to breathe a spirit of enthusiasm and they frequently give vent to the most fervid ejaculations such as d  n my blood  damnation  zounds etc it is imagined

bellum hoc hoc bellum an romule ceves persius there is not in the whole province of an author a point of greater difficulty to attain than what is called a good style an expression which is in every bodys mouth but as i take it very little understood by the present critics i shall endeavor in this paper to reduce into some sort of order the several scattered thoughts which recurred to my mind upon this subject in a vague manner a few days since  the term style if i mistake not is derived from the stylus of the romans which was an instrument used by them in writing upon wax one end of it fashioned to cut the letters and the other formed to efface the impression whenever it should be judged proper hence horace advises a writer who would aspire to the fame of being worth reading to turn his stilevery often that is to rub out and alter the arrangement and choice of his words  saepe stylum vertas iterum quae digna legi sunt scripturus  from this turning and altering is deducible the meaning of this expression which is a proper choice of words in a regular and harmonious disposition this requires a great deal of art and without a just sense of the force and beauty of language can never be performed in any degree of perfection in some we never can perceive the least tendency toward it which renders their works not very palatable to the reader and in those who have by practice cultivated this talent it is an embellishment to good sense gives a luster and elegance to every thing the author advances and renders his productions pleasing and inviting i believe there are to be found several critics from whose works a good plodding head may extract very sound and sensible observations upon all branches of literature but while there are those who treat the same subject with a delicate touch he must be lamentably dull that would have recourse to the former and while longinus addison and spence are not lost to us the dutch commentators will lie mouldering on stalls and in the dusty libraries of insipid pedants  to attempt to lay down rules for the acquirement of this quality might perhaps carry with it an appearance of a tacit declaration that i am master of it myself which i am far from the vanity of believing but it appears to me that what mr lock mentions as the chief thing to be attended to in the conduct of the understanding is also a necessary step toward this accomplishment the thing i mean is an habit of thinking in train on whatever subject the mind may choose to expatiate upon by which means our thoughts will follow in a natural order each arising and growing out of the former and the whole connected in all its parts will by these means be a regular composition which at one glance the reader may take in and carry in his mind there is an association between almost all our ideas and whenever one of them presents itself to the imagination an whole train is wakened into life so that if an author has enlarged his understanding and enriched himself with a tolerable stock of knowledge he need not be apprehensive but his thoughts will offer fast enough and that too if he has habituated himself to the government of his faculties above described in a regular series this would prevent that violent straining very perceptible in some gentlemen of the quill that manner of flying off from one subject to another in a wild incoherent manner which serves only to bewilder the reader who expects something of method and not being able to attend his author into the realms of chaos and old night he throws him aside as a vague wandering genius whom he can make nothing of  i am aware that what has been premised may appear to an hasty peruser digressive from the matter i first set out with but thinking is so intimately connected with what is called style that it is entirely coincident with the design of this essay and is so essential to a composition that without it elegance can never be expected and with it it is odds that it will never be wanting to furnish the mind with knowledge is a rule of the ablest of critics and words says he will never be deficient to cloth our ideas  to think clearly therefore is the original source of good writing and he who considers things with perspicuity will also aim at the same in conveying his sentiments to others this is the main use of language and on this account a good writer will avoid all affectation of glittering all false ambitious ornaments all prettinesses all conceits quaint turns points and antitheses which never can give strength to an argument and only serve to enervate and corrupt the imagination as no language can possibly have a competency of terms appropriated to every different idea recourse was had to the metaphor which consists in transferring the name of one object to another on account of some resemblance subsisting between them but by this in the nature of things it never could be intended that an whole piece should be carried on in a string of borrowed phrases every body knows how cloying this manner is in some of the most eminent writers of the last century and it would not be hard to point out some of the present tribe who put off every thing in such a motly mixture of farfetched terms and allusions that the sense is hid under a flourish of tuneful periods which by the injudicious is called a good style and a pretty flow cicero the father of eloquence and the excellent quintilian in several passages have condemned the two frequent insertion of metaphors and vida who was both a poet and a critic has elegantly described those writers who disdain to express their thoughts in the terms appropriated to them and though the subject does not require it must need set off every thing in the delusive coloring of figurative language  namque aliqui exercent vim duram and rebus iniqui nativam eripiunt formam indignantibus ipsis invitasque jubent alienos sumere vultus i believe the late dean swift understood the true genuine beauties of writing as well as any author ancient or modern and i would advise the reader to open any part of his works and try whether he can find any thing of this florid manner that at present serves to elevate and surprise i am convinced that no man of common apprehension need ever read a sentence twice over in any of this writers productions his method is perspicuous and at the same time elegant without false embellishments and his metaphors all bearing a palpable allusion to the thing they are introduced to signify this is a point which should be always be considered and even then they should not be sowed too thick nor pursued with a pitiful ambition to too great a length whenever i find a person erring on this head he appears to me in the light of a child who has blown a bubble prettily variegated and pleasing to his fancy and then follows it in order to keep up the illusion as long as he can in short it has happened in language as in commerce what was first intended to supply our natural deficiencies is now by the depravity of the human mind perverted into a vice the transgression on the one hand has been sufficiently condemned by all moralists and in the eye of a just critic nothing can be more blameable than a luxury of words  i know there are many other corruptions which contribute to vitiate a true taste but i have dwelt longer on this as it appears to me to be the reigning fault of all our pretty essayists at present but if metaphor is considered in the light i have stated it as only an aid to the perspicuity of language it will no longer pass for an elegance when it is not subservient to its original institution add to this that all tedious circumlocution should be quite exploded though it is an excellent subterfuge to him who wants to spin out the sheet to be a great while saying and saying nothing helps out many a tritical essay writer a multiplicity of words of the same import with a profusion of epithets is also very useful upon a pinch but i believe it is unnecessary to observe that there cannot be a greater error it should also be remembered that every species of writing has its peculiar manner and its own proper coloring and whenever the distinguishing qualities of each are not preserved whenever the different boundaries are invaded then all propriety in writing is destroyed a true style should be clear of all foreign infusions like the river marsyas which curtius tells us glides pure and unmixed within the fortifications of a town in asia free from any adventitious waters to pollute the limpid stream but when without the walls it pours along with a more impetuous current and a swelling surge it no longer retains its original name but then commences to be styled the river lycus cum extra munimenta se evolvit majore vi ac mole agentem undas lycum appellant  after the choice of our words the arrangement of them is to be attended to and in this consists a great deal of the writers art the reference which the several terms in a sentence bear to one another the strength they acquire by being joined with proper epithets the luster they reflect upon an whole period when disposed with such an artful brevity that nothing is perplexed or entangled are all points of moment in a composition and at the same time that they render every thing clearer they give grace and harmony to the whole  the particulars here insisted on are in my opinion the constituents of a good stle but as i am apprehensive i may have been all this time giving a specimen of a very bad one myself i shall here release my

quemque voluptas virgil in a former paper i mentioned that i belong to a club which meets once in every week at the devil tavern near temple bar i then promised my readers to make them acquainted with the nature of this meeting the characters of the several members and the oddities in my own temper which entitle me to a place in this extraordinary society and therefore i shall make an account of it the subject of this days lucubration  our club is called the club of originals by an original we do not mean a character entirely new and such as has never been seen in the world before but we intend by it a person of an independent understanding whose distinguishing marks are not contracted by an affected imitation of others but are absolutely native and constitutional in the very frame and temper of his mind as i had the honor of filling the chair the last club night i shall begin with myself though i am aware that a public writer should remain as much behind the curtain as possible on account of the prejudices which arise against a known author  i have perhaps as many whims in my turn of mind as any man whatever and they adhere to me so tenaciously that i cannot disengage myself from them notwithstanding all the pains i have been at i cannot induce myself to carry a supernumerary ace in my pocket to a bragtable i could never contract an intimacy in a gentlemans family in order to debauch his daughter or carry on a design upon his wife i had rather lose my joke at any time than my friend and i am so awkward that i cannot attempt to bilk a boxkeeper add to this i am far from being a freethinker notwithstanding the very great reputation to be acquired by it i am sensible that these are unaccountable oddities and it does not escape me that in so enlightened and accomplished an age as this they must set a man in a very disadvantageous light but the truth of it is they have taken such root in my mind that i am apprehensive i shall never be able to attain that elegance of life and taste which is remarkable in some of my neighbors  the next who is to sit for his picture is a gentleman of the most extensive knowledge in all branches of polite literature his name is candid remarkable for his knowledge in critical learning but what constitutes the oddity of his character is that he is a critic with goodnature no man has quicker sensations than mr candid and hence it results that in perusing the works of antiquity or those writers among the moderns of allowed reputation their beautiful passages strike so forcibly on his imagination that he admires them to a degree of rapture it may be imagined that this warmth of temper hurries him sometimes into a false applause but his judgment is so deliberate that he generally withholds his admiration till he is perfectly satisfied that the sentiment and diction are just and he is never known to be imposed upon by false embellishments of style or those ambitious ornaments in writing which are censured by horace to this refinement of taste mr candid has joined the most finished good breeding which renders his company extremely desirable and he is a source from whence those of his acquaintance derive many excellent observations upon every kind of different writing  mr abraham gulliver follows in order of succession to the chair a gentleman of very diverting humors and descended as he himself informs us from that very gulliver whose travels have been collected with so much accuracy by the late doctor swift the love of recounting adventures i believe runs in his blood and he frequently sets the company a staring at the surprising incidents he has met with his passion for voyaging was formerly so prevalent in him that he never omitted an opportunity of sailing for it as he expresses it and merely to gratify this inclination he embarked in lord ansons squadron found the world he has lost one eye and part of his chin in that expedition but he does not repine at the accident as he says it is made up to him in the acquirement of knowledge which he insists no man can be said to possess who has not crossed the line and attempted the northeast passage he has conversed with a bramin in the east and there is no place in the map of which he cannot give some account he certainly has laid up a large fund of knowledge but that tinged with so many oddities that he is a whimsical member of society  after mr gulliver my friend harry wildair whom i have mentioned in a former paper as my coadjutor in the articles of intelligence claims our attention harry wildair has a quick insight into men and manners and nobody better knows the characteristic marks and latent foibles of all whom he meets in the social intercourse of life joined to this sharpness of discernment he has made great enquiry into the connections and business of mankind and is actuated by so strong a desire of novelty that he has fixed his residence at charing cross that he may have an opportunity of observing the mighty throng which is constantly pressing that way he can tell by the coat of arms to whom each passing coach belongs and if by chance a vehicle unobserved before occurs to him he is sure to run after it through nine or ten streets in order to satisfy his curiosity in short my friend wildair is all spirit and frolic is foremost in every scene both in high and low life and he is equally pleasant upon the finer foibles of the polite and the strong humors of the inferior class from whence it results that he is never without a fund of gallantry and humor and his conversation abounds with a gay and sprightly variety  the next of the society is counselor plastic of the inner temple counselor plastic was called to the bar in the year    0 but the death of his elder brother soon rendering it unnecessary for him to attend his profession he laid aside the long robe and has since indulged himself in the gratification of his natural cast of mind instead of walking in westminster hall he takes a turn every day in the lyceum or saunters in the groves of academus in plain terms mr plastic is a complete shaftesburian philosopher like all the gentlemen of that inclining he has a polite taste for the imitative arts his imagination is warm and elegant and he has entirely a muselike apprehension with all this there is a peculiarity in every thing he says or does the christian system cannot stand his art in ridicule which he calls the test of truth and he adores a deity of his own making the doctrine of rewards and punishments is to him abominable and his discourse generally turns on ideas of beauty and virtue besides the five senses in common with his neighbors this gentleman has a moral sense a sense of honor a public sense an internal sense and many other powers of perception not mentioned in lockes essay which is in my humble opinion the most accurate history of the human mind in short counselor plastics imagination has attained a great degree of refinement and his disinterested benevolence is frequently laughed at by mr allcash who stands last upon the list  it is owing to a whim of this gentlemans that our meeting is fixed at the devil tavern as he has made a resolution never to go beyond the bar mr allcash is esteemed to be worth half a plum and is now pretty well recovered from the shock he received by the reduction of interest as he has spent most of his time in a constant intercourse with scriveners and stockjobbers he has discovered the artifices of that class of men and he is satisfied from that partial view of mankind that he knows the world he is extremely fond of a maxim in hudibras what is worth in any thing but so much money as twill bring this with him is the test of truth which he opposes in his joking way to the shaftesburian rule he declares that he had rather have a sense of money than all the elegant senses above mentioned and he is a constant attendant at church as he says from a sincere motive of piety though it is hinted by mr plastic that he does this because he thinks it is his interest to be saved  these are the members of the club of originals which has been instituted upon the commencement of

language of this sort is a phrase i have somewhere met with viz les petites morales which is used by them to signify those subordinate points of behavior which cannot be looked upon in the same light with concerns of an higher moment but are however so essential to our conduct in life that they are thence denominated lesser morals a small share of common sense will point these out to every mans observation but as the infringement of them is frequent and very often attended with serious consequences it properly comes within the province of a public writer to correct these lesser deviations and therefore i have set apart this day to animadvert upon a transgression of this nature  the offense i mean is the notable art of humbugging which started up of late years and has made such an extensive progress that it is now enlarged into a general fashion and calls aloud for a censor and here it may not be improper to remind people of the true definition of wit which consists in reconciling ideas between which there is no palpable congruity in a sudden lively association to this i will add that humor is the talent of discerning the oddities which constitute the great variety of characters this kingdom is famous for and exhibiting them in ridiculous colors to the eye of the world things being thus circumstanced i would ask the tribe of humbuggers how far a plausible lie with a grave countenance will give them a pretension to either of the two faculties above described the truth of it is they are but pitiful attendants on the camp of false wit and if they would consider how easily it is to falsify and how hard to do it with pleasantry they would in my opinion desist from so unpolite an art than which i do not remember any thing more gross more stupid and more senseless an author of the first magnitude i think the late dr swift observes that he never knew above one good lie in his life and that one i will venture to say was told by himself and we may

facetiousness propagated and in this is contained all the wit and all the humor and all the fun of all the humbuggers of the age  i could wish that this tribe had subsisted in the days of horace because then we should have them under some proper appellation delivered down to posterity with the ambubaiarum collegia pharmacopolae mendici mimi balatrones hoc genus omne but i do not think that the polite authors of greece and rome seem to have the faintest idea of this egregious turn in all the characters of la bruyere there is no such monster to be found the wits of king charless time were absolutely ignorant of it in the reign of queen anne which to use the words of a fine author notwithstanding the happy days that have succeeded every briton may yet remember i say in the reign of queen anne when wit humor imagination and every elegant talent were in their highest perfection nothing of this sort arose in short it seems entirely reserved to grace the annals of these latter days and i make no doubt but it will give a surprising eclat to the pages of some future historian to have it related in a pompous style that in the reign of his majesty king george the second by the grace of god king of great britain france and ireland defender of the faith and so forth the never enough to be admired art of humbugging came into vogue and was the amusement of tea tables the delight of the court and the study of beaux and pretty gentlemen from whom it descended to all ranks of people and became the general fashion of the kingdom  instead of expatiating any further on this sprightly absurdity i shall close this paper with a passage from lord shaftsbury whose decision upon wit and manners i believe will not be contested  it is real humanity and kindness to hide strong truths from tender eyes and to do this by pleasant amusement is easier and civiller than by a harsh denial or remarkable reserve but to go about industriously to confound men in a mysterious manner and to make advantage and draw pleasure from that perplexity they are thrown into by such uncertain talk is as unhandsome in a way of raillery as when done with the greatest seriousness or in the most solemn way of deceit it may be necessary as well now as heretofore for wise men to speak in parables with a double meaning that the enemy may be amused and they only who have ears to hear may hear but it is certainly a mean impotent and dull sort of wit which amuses all alike and leaves the most sensible man and even a friend equally in doubt and at a loss to understand what ones real mind is upon any subject this is that gross sort of raillery which is so offensive in good company and indeed there is as much difference between one sort and another as between fair dealing and hypocrisy or between

some particulars was i do not doubt extremely pleasing as to its general purport to a man of your character for my part i have ever beheld with pleasure the motto with which a certain eminent physician has long adorned his chariot viz non sibi sed toti and am for promoting industry in a more exalted signification of the word than that in which it is most commonly used i mean as it tends to the good of mankind without the least tincture of private advantage  when very young i remember to have read in some author that the turks are obliged to exercise some trade or occupation which may contribute to the public emolument and that even their emperors have no exemption from this institution it is true a certain sultan a kind of wag very artfully evaded the force of the law by the following device the musti it seems had reproved him for being so unmindful of what their prophet had expressly enjoined as to spend all his time in following hawks and hounds the next morning the wily sultan sent his troublesome monitor an handsome present of wild fowl and venison informing him at the same time that being convinced of the justness of his reproof he had in consequence thereof taken up the trade of a hunter  far from approving such a mohammedan equivocation i began to consider wherein i could be of the most general use to my fellow creatures without the least regard to any selfish views i found myself in possession of an ample patrimony and consequently a subsistence was out of the question as to divinity law the navy or army i was aware that they carry with them some glittering toy which more or less attracts the hearts of even the most philosophic of their followers a mitre for example the great seal a flag at the maintop or a truncheon have their respective charms and no doubt operate accordingly on the conduct of their several admirers  to all these allurements i resolutely shut my eyes and determined to set a noble example void of any the least concomitant selfinterest thus resolved to dedicate my time and studies to the service of man including woman i made choice of an occupation of universal consequence to the world but of which none except a few mercenary pretenders have ever made public profession not to keep you any longer in suspense mr ranger the profession i have taken up and exercised for some years is that of a dentifricator or what the vulgar call a cleaner of teeth i have heard with rapture of a certain worcestershire squire who formerly applied himself with great success as well as assiduity to cutting and curing the corns of all those he could persuade to make an experiment of his skill not long since a noble peer was famous for thirsting after a few ounces of the blood of all who came near him not from any cruelty of temper but purely on account of the exquisite and laudable pleasure he took in the use of the lancet even peter the great the immortal refiner of the russian empire greatly delighted in drawing the teeth of every one who betrayed a pain in those parts by holding his handkerchief to his mouth by making wry faces or any such indications of this i have been assured by an eyewitness of his dexterity to the common soldiers he gave a crown for every tooth he deprived them of which indeed encouraged so many poor wretches who were ignorant of the value of their grinders to undergo the operation of an imperial hand that the officers remonstrated to his majesty that if he continued to make such depredations in the months of the soldiery he might disband his troops as they would be fit for service no longer than they could eat  to a persen of mr rangers sagacity i need not remark how much my profession of cleaning beautifying and preserving the teeth surpasses the inconsiderate zeal of that great man every one is sensible how much we surpass all other nations in the bravery of our soldiers and the dexterity as well as intrepidity of our mariners and yet it is well known that all this depends on eating and of course on the goodness of their teeth and as to our beaux and belles how much the force of their charms is assisted by a delicate set of teeth is a truth so evident in itself as not to need the least demonstration  in consequence of these reflections i applied myself to study every author who has wrote on this subject i went so far as to take an arabian into my house to instruct me in his language that i might be able to consult the writers of his country in the original as well as the authors of greece and rome after this i traveled over all europe to converse with such as profess this noble and delectable operation i have even put myself in their hands in order to acquire every excellence as well as avoid every defect incidental to my brother operators  some time since mr ranger you favored us with an account of the progress you had made in physiognomy you therefore will easily believe what i am going to relate of my own sagacity by a curious and exact observation of the various marks on the teeth in different persons from the continual friction they undergo as well from each other as from the tongue and lips i am able to discover what passions their several owners are subject to and how far they indulge them particularly as to anger envy or love it is an old remark that proverbs are a kind of test of national wisdom and are either literally or allegorically founded on truths of no small importance now i need only instance a few of these pithy sentences to convince the most incredulous what great discoveries may be made by a skilful contemplator in this way as for instance such a one has all his eyeteeth  he shows his teeth but cannot bite  a third has a soft tooth in his head  this good lady has a colts tooth left yet  another has a liquorish tooth etc i have made many observations of this nature and even at first sight i can discover whether a certain mark be out of a young ladys mouth or not in plain english whether she be in a state of pure virginity or has really given it up or in what degree of danger she is of so doing by the indications her teeth contract from being frequently applied to the sheets or pillows in some i have discovered after their having been in company with two sistergraces a certain duchess and countess that shall be nameless whether their teeth have been affected by the corrosive qualities arising from envy or brightened by the motion of the lips occasioned by the smiles of a pleasing admiration  i have already taken up too much of your time and therefore decline giving you an account of my travels for the narrow considerations of wife or family cannot long detain me at home in search of all opportunities of improving myself in the art of preserving and beautifying those useful implements the teeth it is true i was lately very near abandoning my profession through the treatment i met with from a certain great prince in germany who pretending to want my assistance no sooner got my finger in his mouth than closing his foreteeth he held me fast in the greatest pain imaginable and at the same time he spoiled with one of his grinders the nicest

dearth of good papers of late i am surprised that any advances are made toward it the pangs of despised wit are perhaps equal to those of despised love and one would imagine them sufficient to extinguish an authors honest emulation and to determine him to think a post of inglorious ease more eligible than that state of warfare he must be involved in as a writer it is to no purpose to plead

the use and he seemed to take a malicious pleasure at the shrilness of the sound in process of time an hornbook was procured for the young gentleman and at the first sight of it he grew extremely peevish and shortly after began to pull it to pieces in this he was encouraged by his grandmother who alleged it would spoil the childs eyes but it is confidently said that he at last took to it of himself but that he applied at random in a very irregular manner and i am credibly informed that he could not be induced to pursue the alphabet in its natural order but that the first letters he

the titlepages of books and pamphlets in order the more effectually to abuse them  our youth in his countenance had a blended resemblance to his parents with a very great air of his grandmother from his grandsire he derived a disposition to all kinds of vice and therefore the evil qualities of his father thrived in a soil admirably fitted for their reception pleasure he was an utter stranger to unless the misfortunes of his neighbors excited the mixed sensations of that malignant joy mentioned by ovid  risus abest nisi quem visi movere dolores nothing could ever rouse him to an emulation of others whom he perceived to excel but he sat pining and selftormented at the idea of their merit and having a volubility of speech from his mother he vented his spleen in obloquy and scandalous invective in these qualities he made great improvement and each day added some new accomplishment such as impudence pertness illmanners etc  being now arrived at maturity he grew wondrous fond of

improvements he endeavored to nip him in the bud  to conclude criticism has been upon town for several years and still continues in the practice of every bad quality deducible from a weak head and a corrupt heart but as i intend to persevere in the work i have undertaken i will cut matters short and inform this gentleman and all his followers that after this i shall not suffer myself to be diverted from the drift of this design i think i shall be able to offer some compositions not quite unworthy of the public perusal and if i do not point out any unknown truths i shall endeavor to place every thing in a point of view that i hope will sometimes give it the graces of novelty  i shall continue to prefix a motto to each lucubration from some celebrated author of antiquity and this not out of any affectation but because from an early taste for those excellent writers many of their beauties have insinuated themselves into my imagination in so lively a manner that they recur on almost every topic this serves very often with the classic scholar to place an entire essay before his eye at once and to see a fine passage start into a new light and carry a witty allusion to a

will be relished at least by those readers who have had an opportunity of observing the ridiculous manner in which our countrymen spend their time in that elegant metropolis of the polite world  paris jan  0      dear harry i have been in this strange place about six weeks and find myself in such a whimsical situation that i may truly say with petulant in the way of the world i am like a dog in a dancingschool upon our first arrival here we took a fiacre and drove to our banker who lives up four pair of stairs as he was our countryman we thought him the most proper person to direct us and accordingly enquired whether there were any good lodgings to be let in the rue de boncherie for you must know harry we were informed before we left england by some gentlemen who said they knew paris very well that we should take up our residence in that part of the town  but the banker smiled at the question and told us that the english gentlemen had deserted that famous street ever since the harlequin at the italian comedy in making love to his mistress told her among other professions of his passion that he loved her as violently as my lord anglois did the rue de boucherie he added that he would take care to fix us in a proper lodging and conducted us to peyri bagneur in the rue dauphine who accommodated us with a very good apartment our next care was to equip ourselves in the fashion of the country accordingly we sent for a tailor and jack commons who jabbers a little french directed him to make us two suits which he brought us the next morning at ten oclock and made complete frenchmen of us but for my part harry i was so damned uneasy in a fulldressed coat with hellish long skirts which i had never been used to that i thought myself as much deprived of my liberty as if i had been in the bastile and i frequently sighed for my little loose frock which i look upon as an emblem of our happy constitution for it lays a man under no uneasy restraint but leaves it in his power to do as he pleases i must not forget to inform you that we hired a swiss servant whom they call here valet de place and to him we entrusted the management of every thing which saves us a great deal of trouble and i really believe the fellow to be extremely honest for i do not find that i spend more money here than in london as it is absolutely necessary to have a coach in paris we engaged a remise during our stay and indeed it was indispensably incumbent upon us to set up an equipage for we commenced lords immediately upon entering the fauxbourg st germain  z  ds harry these

them a visit des petits my lords you may believe my friend i was very desirous to see their theatrical entertainments  i have indeed been at one or other of them every night they are d  strange sir  not the thing by any means  i do not it is true understand the language but their manner is quite different from ours  the players seldom or ever throw out the voice with any vehemence but speak in as natural a manner as if they were off the stage  that would not be borne with us you know however the french are pleased with it as they know no better the first time i was at the playhouse i imagined there had been a riot the night before for i observed there were no benches in the pit but in this i was mistaken for there never are any seats in that part of the house the reason is i suppose because a frenchman could not sit still during the performance with respect to the manner of living harry it is intolerable by heavens i should have been starved if i had not luckily got acquainted with an irish abbe of lombard college one mr m manus a very good sort of a man though a popish priest he has a cursed queer way of talking indeed his accent being a mixture of the brogue and the french cadence and his phrases generally literal translations from the french he is notwithstanding a d  d honest fellow and will get drunk with any of his friends at a minutes warning if it had not been for this gentleman who conducted me to a little place kept by one kemp where i got a leg of mutton and turnips and beefstakes i should have been obliged to set out post for england  it is true upon honor  my life was at stake  i could by no means live upon their soup and bully and footy kickshaws made of stinking meat their wines it must be allowed are pretty enough when one is used to them but at first they seem prodigious weak they have not half the body of our wines in england but that is easily accounted for the best growths being always sent to us at least venables and tomkins tell me so in mentioning kemps i should have told you of an ugly scrape i had like to have fallen into i got into company with an officer of the scotch troops in the french kings service and i began to hum him about party affairs but d  n me he soon gave me to understand that i was on the wrong side the water for that fun and insisted that i should give immediate satisfaction gad i reflected it would be confoundedly silly to get pinked in a popish country where they would not allow me a christian burial and so i asked his pardon and the affair was made up by the mediation of abbe m manus this has cured me from attempting any sport of that kind while i stay here you will be surprised perhaps that i give you no account of the people to tell you the truth my friend i do not know any of them i went once to an ordinary and the company were so remarkably civil to me that i began to think they had a design upon me but my friend jack commons who has studied the law and knows these things tells me this excessive politeness proceeds from their living under an arbitrary government i cannot help laughing at the immense number of chevaliers de st louis which i meet every where these gentlemen are as numerous here as knights have been in the city of london since the year fortythree they wear a little enamelled cross hanging to a red ribbon which is fixed in a button hole of the coat and most of them have a streak of dirt on their white silkstockings about an inch above the shoe which i suppose is part of the order as to the government of this country i have not thought it worth my while to enquire about it for i am satisfied with old england and there will end my days i have had very few amors since i left england for i do not know how it is i am d  d shy of the women here they are so devilish sprightly  i know three or four of them whom my barber recommended me to but they are not of the first class  to conclude dear harry mr mmanus has carried me through all the curiosities in and about paris and now my time lies very heavy on my hands for as i have no acquaintance and am unwilling to enter into any connection with people in a strange country i am at a loss what to do with myself in an evening the day i contrive to pass away tolerably in sauntering in the tuilleries until dinner which brings all the english together at kemps from thence we adjourn to procopes until it is time to go to the play which kills the time to about half an hour after eight but when the actors dismiss us we are perplexed to determine how we shall dispose of ourselves and are in the end obliged in our own defense to return to kemps and play a game at whist this way of life will not do with me and in about a fortnight you may expect to see me when we will laugh over

this paper is not a consederacy in riot and debauchery but was instituted with a view of enjoying a pleasing converse rather than of contending with each other for the renown of the most potent constitution or the most capacious swallow accordingly our discourse generally turns upon some topic that may serve to disclose the humors of mankind or carry our taste to a greater degree of refinement in the polite arts  an evening of this sort i was sure to enjoy at our last meeting as the chair was to be filled by mr candid whom i have formerly described as a very odd critic good nature and knowledge being peculiarities remarkable in his character as soon as the mutual civilities were exchanged between the company this gentleman acquainted us with an occurrence which is really of a very extraordinary nature as he was walking in the piazzas at covent garden he perceived a man extremely busy in pasting up against the walls advertisements of so singular a furport that he was induced to beg one of them which was read out to the club and was in substance as follows  lately launched at deptford a ship called the pantomime now lying at irongate whereof is owner john lun burden seven hundred tons mounts four and thirty guns and bound directly for the southseas in quest of monsters of all sorts to cruize for some time in those parts and thence to bear away to the unknown world to touch upon the coasts of asia and africa and return home north about in order to stock our theaters with the wildest exotics that can be met with good encouragement will be given to all seafaring men who will ship themselves on board the pantomime above mentioned and as a corpse of marines will be requisite disappointed fortunehunters broken gamesters henpeckd husbands underactors etc shall be received and enter into commission forthwith  n b apply to any of the brokers on change at sams coffee house georges temple bar the bedford or the stagedoor of the theater in covent garden  this piece of intelligence gave no small astonishment to the rest of the company but our chairman declared he had seen so many strange turns in life that he did not doubt but it would be absolutely carried into execution and added that it would certainly draw prodigious houses to have it mentioned in the playbills that the principal parts in a new entertainment will be performed by a wonderful armadillo from brasil a serpent from the river oronoque the famous lanthornfly from peru a mermaid from the ladrones islands a surprising camel a rhinoceros and many horrible animals being their first appearance on the english stage  mr candid proceeded to observe that poor shakespeare who used to flourish like the thorn at glastonbury in the depth of winter must now entirely be destroyed but however to prevent as far as in him lay this threatening mischief he informed us that he has drawn up with no small pains a pamphlet entitled a modest proposal against abolishing nature and shakespeare at this juncture addressed to david garrick esquire with whom he hoped it would have due weight as all his performances have displayed a true relish for our great poets masterly touches and as the course of his management has proved him to be a cordial friend to genius and letters  and now since i have mentioned mr garrick continued he i had rather see him come out from the murder of duncan in the character of macbeth with the daggers in his hands than behold a fountain of tin playing in jetteaus a real cascade or a countrydance by all the monsters of the creation  i may be out in my taste but there are touches of nature in the play just mentioned which i shall always reflect upon with pleasure though i cannot help wondering that garrick who always strikes out the brightest ideas should attach himself to the common reading of a line in the part of macbeth when so noble a meaning is to be extracted from the same passage the thing i mean is when he looks at his hands and breaks out into the following speech with all great neptunes ocean wash this blood clean from my hand no  this my hand will rather the multitudinous sea incarnadine making the green one red the last line is generally pronounced as if shakespeare meant the greenone which after the pompous expression of the multitudinous sea would render it liable to the imputation of an anticlimax whereas if it is understood as making the green  one red i e the color of the sea which is of itself green one entire universal red it would close the passage with a dignity responsive to what precedes and adequate to the vastness of shakespeares conception as it not only keeps up the image impressed upon the mind by the term multitudinous sea but also heightens the horror of macbeths crime the blood he has spilt being sufficient to convert the natural color of the whole ocean into  one red  this interpretation may perhaps not appear orthodox to those who are bigoted to playhouse tradition but by our whole club it was thought extremely just and mr plastic the shaftsburian philosopher received it with an air of enthusiasm declaring that it suggested an idea which expanded the imagination the more it dwelt upon it after this he offered some doubts which arose in his mind concerning a passage in the same play of which he conceived the meaning though he did not see the propriety and consistence of the figures the lines hinted at are in macbeths soliloquy concerning the deed he was to perpetrate  i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself and falls on the other  mr candid immediately reassumed the discourse the first thing to be observed said he is the rapidity of shakespeares imagination and the quick succession of ideas which it supplied him with the metaphorical expression in the verse  i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent  gave occasion to the figure following in the succeeding line  but vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself and falls on the other  the allusion is to a managed horse and ambition is represented as a person who endeavoring to vault into the seat by the violence of his effort overleaps himself and falls quite on the other side  the shaftsburian returned thanks for the light thrown upon this place and observed that the interpretation is perfectly applicable to the circumstances and conduct of macbeth when mr allcash the citizen interposed and told us that for his part he did not mind your plays much  that he went to see garrick at goodmans fields and could not help laughing to see the people cry at king lear when he knew it was all a play and paid his money for it this contributed to ruffle the temper of mr plastic who instantly harangued upon the public sense the moral sense and the internal sense but mr allcash was not to be beat out of his way and instead of paying any deference to this doctrine he desired an explanation of a line in othello where iago says who steals my purse steals trash it is something nothing is there not said he some mistake in calling money trash and something nothing  the chairman smiled at this observation which he promised to consider at his leisure and for the present proceeded to give a correction of a mistake in othello in the fifth act of which iago says to roderigo i have rubbed this gnat almost to the sense and he grows angry the common editions give us the lines in this manner and mr warburton has done the same theobald is the only editor who saw the absurdity to rub a gnat as he observes though ever so gently would rub it out of all sense and would effectually kill it yet though he perceived the error it seems he knew not how to mend it the quarto editions mr candid told us instead of gnat read quat or quot but theobald continued he not knowing the meaning of the word alters it to knot the name of a bird and has a long note to justify the correction but the old books are perfectly right a quat or quot being a small heat or pimple which by itching provokes us to scratch it and when rubbed to the quick or sense it becomes hot and angry the word has not perhaps the authority of any contemporary writer but must certainly be shakespeares as it is still used in warwickshire the native country of the old bard and in northamptonshire where i passed a good many months a few years since it still carries with it the meaning already assigned to it  our chairman ceased here and i apprehend that the communicating this remark will be agreeable to all the admirers of shakespeare and i am apt to think that many passages of the poet seemingly corrupted are to be illustrated not from books but from the customs and dialect of the people many of the terms which appear quite antiquated and obsolete being as i am informed still used in the northern parts of the kingdom  our researches into literature ended here and the company immediately withdrew like satisfied guests if my readers should rise from the perusal of this lucubration with the same relish i shall have gained the end proposed by this account of our transactions  true intelligence extract of a letter from dublin dear

and as an incident offered after it broke up which gave rise to the speculation of this day i beg that this paper may be received as a sequel to it  the majority of our worthy members returned home rather sooner than is usual with them at length mr candid and myself were the only two remaining as we drew nearer to the fire and to each other our hearts began to throw off all reserve and the conversation which before was vague and upon general topics of literature became gradually more confined and at length it centered wholly on ourselves mr candid amongst other particulars began to congratulate with me on my address and reputation as a writer and the credit he was pleased to say i had acquired in conducting the paper which bears my name your reputation mr ranger says he is at present in its early bloom the aspect of the public shines on you with a cheering influence and warmth but you are not to imagine it will be always thus the sky may be overcast and the enlivening radiance intercepted a chilling frost may unexpectedly succeed and nip all your blossoms in the bud to drop the metaphor continued he the countenance and encouragement of the public may be withdrawn and at a time when you are exerting all your talents to deserve and secure it popular favor and popular prejudice are the most capricious things imaginable disgust will often arise where no satiety has been given and mutual confidence and good liking will unaccountably degenerate to coldness suspicion and indifference yet it may be difficult to say from whence this alteration is occasioned or whether it is owing to the pretensions of the writer or the reader but in this case perhaps as in most others there may be faults on both sides exorbitant claims are not so easily adjusted especially where the parties are equally unwilling to recede from their presumptive rights the author is often unreasonable in his demands for fame and the public as hard to be gratified in their expectation of pleasure you are at present considered as a new writer the delicacies you regale the town with are a dish unthought of by your fellowcaterers for the general entertainment but these in time will become familiar to our taste your wit will then be censured to have lost its poignancy and your humor its relish i was going to make a suitable reply to so obliging an encomium when my friend prevented me by observing that the evening was now far advanced and that it became us as originals not to prolong our compotations to the modern midnight hours of conversation  in retiring to my chambers i could not forbear ruminating on the sentiments of my penetrating acquaintance and resolved to throw together a few reflections upon what may be termed novelty in writing  i think then that judicious imitation either of ancient or modern standards ought not to be stigmatized as larceny in an author he is certainly at liberty to draw from any excellent model whom he chooses to copy and that without incurring the ignominious appellations of a plagiary or transcriber universal custom will justify the practice all the imitative arts may be more particularly termed so as the several masters have frequently worked after a plan that was first sketched out by some eminent example the same design diversified indeed with newer decorations as genius or invention prompted may be traced in the different performances of subsequent artists sometimes extended by the addition of circumstances which naturally grew out of the work or contracted by pruning the luxuriant branches and retrenching what appeared superfluous and unnecessary  this general and distant imitation it will be readily owned is allowable and just is what cannot perhaps be easily avoided where the subject is treated with propriety and according to the rules of art thus virgil followed homer thus addison will always be regarded as the pattern either of grave or of humourous speculation and fielding will ever be a faithful guide to the adventurer in comic romance  but there is another kind of imitation which is more direct and literal and which consists in adopting the sentiments and phrase of others of this the legality is yet a question and the practice is generally judged to denote poverty of thought and defect of imagination in the writer the censure is perhaps too rigid or at least may be moderated by some qualifying considerations that suggest themselves to our impartial attention  the transfusion of wit from one language to another when done with elegance and ease has been seldom turned to the disparagement of the author who has abilities to do it when the spirit is not suffered to evaporate but retains all the sprightliness and vigor which it possessed in the original the sentence which i have placed at the head of this paper is an indulgence to an author either for reviving obsolete and antiquated expressions or for the importation of new ones if the liberty be used with modesty and discretion what horace has thus observed with regard to words only may be parity of reason be applied to sentiment and thought  if the language is enriched by the addition of a single term or phrase our stock of knowledge is made still more exuberant by introducing a succession of new ideas in proportion as the value of an ingot is superior to a single coin to discover a new uncommon vein of thinking upon ordinary and beaten topics requires that creative power of imagination which nature has imparted only to her favorites and with a frugal sparing hand authors of inferior genius have easier methods assigned them in their pursuit of fame it must be their merit to select the most agreeable and pleasing imagery to give delicate and graceful turns to obvious and common thoughts and by this means to recommend what is grown familiar to our imagination by the novelty and advantage of its dress a statue which we have ceased to look on with the eyes of admiration when removed to another point of view shall strike us with fresh pleasure and delight a pleasure which results entirely from the novelty and change of its position  there is a couplet in pope which i beg leave to produce as applicable to the sentiments advanced true wit is nature to advantage dressed what often was thought but never so well expressed and this very sentiment which i mention only as relative to the subject and which on any other occasion i should have industriously concealed our ingenious poet has taken from a remark of boileau writers who argue with precision will often unavoidably fall into a coincidence of thought nature and truth are invariable and when several pictures are taken of the same object if they are just copies of the original they will necessarily have a likeness to each other i might add likewise how difficult it is to offer what has not yet been said by any one on subjects that appear exhausted  an humourous acquaintance who often talks to me on this head lays it down as an indisputable principle that composition is only the art of stealing wisely and indeed as matters are usually managed by our worthy fraternity of authors if we strike out the last word his definition is perfectly unexceptionable i make then no scruple to declare that i look on all the wit and all the humor in ancient or modern languages as good and lawful prize and that i shall freely convert them to my own use and the public emolument but then i will take care to do it in such a manner as shall reflect no disgrace to the author from whom i borrow it and that if he comes at any time either in person or by his attorney to demand his property he shall find it employed in the very way which he himself would choose  having said this i give public notice of this my intention to mr town and all his adherents and i advise them withal to keep a good lookout in order to detect and expose me  true intelligence bedford coffeehouse feb   a new sect of philosophers

admirer he immediately contracts his brow looks wise fixes his eye and gravely answers  those are abstract ideas  i wrote an essay upon that subject once  i showed it to a man of judgment and he

every coffee house within the bills of mortality and i have some time past stood listening to the buzz of fame around me as the lion is said when he has filled the forest with terror to stop short in

variety of unknown correspondents from whom i am frequently honored with epistles in this my public capacity some of these gentlemen are so obliging as to pay their compliments to my excellent talents

discuss every thing with decency but hem  i must observe mr president that the objections to revelation arise from an ignorance of the original language in which it was commocnicated for instance the passage relating to jepthas vow has been a great fund of raillery but when we take the full force of the hebrew passage eama jacabasa irraurista diarba diota i apprehend the difficulty disappears i am glad to have this opportoonity of correcting this mistake which gentlemen have gone into in opposing revelation to natooral religion the light of the scriptures mr president leads to the improvement

mr president i have little to offer at present only i must observe that we are all greatly obliged to the worthy member who spoke last for his information he tells us we are of three species the flesh the spirit and gods grace  the former of these he possesses very amply viz the flesh but as to the spirit and gods grace he seems desitute of both for i believe if he had any share of either he would

  president is there any gentleman come in since this debate that chooses to speak  pray gentlemen be silent  you will please to take my watch that i may not transgress my time   the affirmatives in this question has endeavored to invalidate the gospel exhibition but as one gentleman has observed many mistakes arises from the ignorance of the hebrew and to be sure we does he under that disadvantage which is however in some sort removed by the notes in stackhouses bible there is a writer mounseer du pin who though of the romish communion may be allowed sometimes to speak truth though his arguments often militates against himself and i does upon the whole apprehend that revelation or the gospel exhibition like that glorious luminary the sun is of divine original time sir  the

graysinn saturday march        ut pictura poesis erit similisque poesi sit pictura refert par aemula quaeque sororum fresnoys art of painting poetry and painting have been accounted sisterarts by men of taste in all ages and accordingly we find them both in the writings of all good critics from aristotle and horace down to dryden and the abbe du bos mutually borrowing sidelights and reflecting luster upon each other they justly have the precedence among the arts of imitation and design as they convey their ideas by signs more fixed and determinate than any of the others and boast a more unbounded scope to cull and select from all nature in order to adorn and embellish the favorite piece  i am aware that it may be said statuary has very near the same advantage and that the artist in this way may observe the knitting of a joint in one the turn of a neck in another the form of the head in a third the shape and rounding of a limb in a fourth and that in short from a survey of sundry objects a complete and perfect whole may be executed but it must be remembered at the same time that statuary has not so ample a field to range in as the two firstmentioned and is therefore greatly inferior to both  painting in one particular instance seems to gain the ascendant over poetry being universally understood in every clime and every age whereas the latter is confined to much narrower limits both in time and place a raphael painted and a vida wrote at the same period and how confined is the reputation of the latter when compared to the extensive renown which has attended the name of the first through every age and country the era may arrive when through the instability of the english language the style of joseph andrews and tom jones shall be obliterated when the characters shall be unintelligible and the humor lose its relish but the many personages which the mannerspainting hand of hogarth has called forth into mimic life will not fade so soon from the canvass and that admirable picturesque comedy the march to finchley will perhaps divert posterity as long as the foundlinghospital shall do honor to the british nation a picture speaks the language of every nation and is universally felt and understood in many different countries at the same time in this instance partaking the advantages of music which is however subject to many restrictions to which the art of painting is entirely a stranger the caprice and whim of different nations prevent the power of harmony from becoming so universal in its influence for the primary beauty of it consisting in an imitation of the sounds appropriated to our several passions and those sounds varying according to the habits and dialect of every different people it follows of course that the music of any one country must undergo many changes and variations before it can be adapted to the ear of a man who has resided for any time in another kingdom  this inconvenience the art of painting is not subject to and in this respect has the advantage over poetry though in almost every other point it is obliged to yield the preeminence it has been long since observed that truth is agreeable to the understanding and fine imagery to the fancy but neither of them we find affords so intense a pleasure as when the passions are agitated and worked into a ferment we then attach ourselves strongly to the object which excites these emotions we are pleased to be wakened from a state of still life and it is a gratification to our moral sense to find our hearts sensible and alive to those sensations which are the ornament of our nature this being the case i believe it may be asserted without incurring the danger of a controversy that poetry boasts this power over the passions beyond any other art at the same time that it is a vehicle for instruction and derives much of its beauty from the scenes of picturesque imagination painting indeed partakes sufficiently of these qualities to entitle her to the name of sister has many features like and in the execution of her designs is mostly directed by the same rules both must have unity of action and unity of character and both have a latitude to introduce subordinate personages concerned in the main business and to exhibit them in proper attitudes a metaphor may be as bold in painting as in poetry an allegory may be as instructive and pleasing to the fancy upon canvass as in the written page what the critics call machinery may be displayed in as elegant strockes with the pencil as with the pen the fairyway of writing mentioned by dryden may be made use of in colors and the fancy of the artist like a new creation may start to the eye an whole race of imaginary beings some of the finest passages in epic and dramatic poesy are those where a conflict is marked between several warring passions painting throws these immediately before the eye and in tints artfully blended the nice assemblage is delineated in the most striking manner a further instance of the congruity between these two arts is that when a poet has been lavish in a description the best method of examining the justness of it is to consider what kind of figure it would make upon canvass and on the other hand the descriptions which we find in the poets may serve to supply hints and instruction to the painter of taste and poetic imagination add to this that as the chief beauty of poetic diction does not consist in a profusion of ornaments high metaphors and a flourish of words so in the other colors too rich and glowing are disapproved and the excellence of both arts is seen in regular designs and a just imitation of nature  the ancients were enthusiastic admirers of all the imitative arts particularly painting and upon all occasions we find them expressing a taste for the productions of the famous artists accordingly their poets seize every opportunity of describing a picture a piece of sculpture or any of the works of the loom ovid never omits it where it naturally grows out of his subject and virgil never seems more delighted than when he is laying before our eyes the shield of aeneas or like a skilful virtuoso pointing out to our observation the beauties of a fine painting artificumque manus inter se operumque laborem miratur    the pleasure in this case is redoubled upon the mind springing from a twofold source for the delight we take in all poetic description is chiefly owing to the natural love we have for imitation which affords an opportunity of comparing the transcript with the original object and when we peruse the description of a picture we admire not only the poets representation of it but the talent of the artist who has thus contrived to delineate by his pencil so exact a resemblance of things which have their existence in nature and thus the mind has two arts to examine at once and dwells between them both in a suspense of pleasure  i have always admired the description in the first aeneid of that exquisite piece of painting of the wars at troy and i think the poets account of it may suggest to us some notion of the sublime ideas he entertained of the sisterart of poetry all the figures which he mentions are bold and animated every thing is in motion and if i may be allowed to apply a line of mr popes all matter quick and bursting into life what an image have we of the trojans repelling the enemy and of achilles with his nodding plume thundering at their heels in his turn you think you hear the sounding of his carr and you imagine you see him with his arm aloft in act to strike  hac fugerent danai premeret trojana juventus hac phryges instaret curru cristatus achilles the situation of troilus has been often admired and the procession of the trojan nymphs will always excite the tenderest sentiments and i dare affirm a finer groupe was never imagined their dejected looks their dishevelled hair and the beating of their breasts are all striking circumstances  interea ad templum non aequae palladis ibant crinibus iliades passis peplumque ferebant suppliciter tristes and tunsae pectora palmis priam raising his unnerved arms and imploring the body of his son hector from achilles who dragged the corpse thrice round the walls of troy must also afford great room for the expression of several passions all at once struggling in the soul and upon the whole i persuade myself that if such a painting as this great poet has here described were handed down to us it would be the most valuable piece of all antiquity  true intelligence batsons coffee house march   the new tragedy of the gamester which was exhibited at drury lane in the beginning of the last month and in which mr garrick supported the principal character with all those exquisite feelings which the

est imbuta recens servabit odorem testa diu  hor to charles ranger esquire sir prompted by the esteem i have for your entertaining and instructive writings i venture to convey my sentiments to you in relation to some miscarriages in life which proceed rather from ignorance and the want of education than any natural propensity to evil and i am the more induced to this as my own life will afford ample room for reflection  without any further detail you must know then mr ranger that i am the son of a tradesman in the west of england long since deceased the lowness of my fathers circumstances would but barely suffice for the maintenance of a numerous family and you will therefore suggest to yourself that my education could not be better than what is afforded in the generality of countryvillage schools in vain did my father solicit the assistance of a rich relation of his at bristol in vain did he represent the promising genius of his son if put under proper culture deaf to the ties of affinity though possessed of an estate of fifteen hundred per annum and a large personal fortune without the charge of a family and any likelihood of having any he would afford him no assistance and i was therefore obliged after having gleaned up all i could in the short time i was at school to seek a service with a neighboring farmer with him i lived several years driving plough and employed in other sort of husbandry when news arrived of the death of the relation i mentioned and of his having left me all his real estate with six thousand pounds in money and three thousand pounds to each of my four sisters when i tell you that from my education and the nature of my servitude i contracted a very strong bias to low company you will imagine i must make but a very indifferent figure in my new station i was then two and twenty and had never been accustomed to any kind of intemperance and if my former situation had enabled me to have been reckoned company for the gentlemen of the place i might still have continued a sober man but unhappily for me the circumstance of my having been a servant made me notwithstanding the largeness of my fortune shunned and despised and i was constrained to herd with my former companions and others of better substance but abandoned morals with whom i soon acquired an habit of idleness and debauchery by which in a few years i found my ready money exhausted to gratify the extravagance of my passions which were now become violent and unruly i was advised to take up some money upon part of my estate and to this purpose i applied to a neighboring lawyer who soon procured it for me as the meanness of my education had hindered me from knowing any thing of law affairs i got my two companions to overlook the mortgage deed and with their advice signed it and they also set their hands as witnesses  being now in possession of seven thousand pounds i was advised by these my two friends to see the world as they called it and accordingly i set out soon after with them for london leaving the aforesaid lawyer to receive all my rents in the country you will naturally imagine mr ranger that in town i tasted all the pleasures it could give me i saw every thing but still in the worst company and was continually surrounded by a set of sharpers till having squandered away all my money and got considerably in debt i was arrested and sent to the fleet in this situation i directed my lawyer to remit me some money and the arrest gave me no concern as i made no doubt of being quickly at liberty but judge sir my surprise when i was informed that the lawyer was in possession of my whole estate by an absolute surrender from me which i had through ignorance signed instead of a mortgage deed and that my two friends who had left me just before i was arrested appeared for the attorney to witness the whole transaction the bitterness of this calamity and the consciousness of a misspent life filled me with the severest grief and would have entirely extinguished the use of what little reason i had but for the charity of a fellowprisoner who touched with a sense of my misfortunes not only did every thing to alleviate them but infused such a portion of knowledge and philosophy into my mind during our long imprisonment as must for ever render me sensible of his kindness let me finish the account of my life when i have told you that i was freed from my imprisonment by the last act of grace and that with a moderate sustenance procured by honest industry i find myself more happy and contented now than when possessed of affluence and a mind immersed in ignorance and folly  as my sisters received no better education than myself i should tell you that notwithstanding their fortune they are all come to infamy and poverty the eldest soon after our relations death married a labourer to the farmer she had lived with in the station of maid servant and they have run through all they had the second was debauched by the son of the gentleman at whose house she had hired herself and is now in one of the houses of bad fame in covent garden the third married a footman and died about two years ago after having lived in great distress and the fourth with shame i speak it is now mistress to the earl of  from this account of myself and my family i shall only draw one inference that if the relation who left us so liberally at his death had but given us a good education and behaved to us in his lifetime agreeably to the estate he intended to leave us the misfortune we have met with might in all human probability have been avoided and being connected by marriage or otherways with families of credit and reputation we might now remain in affluence and enjoy a name unsullied by vice and infamy i am  sir your very humble servant     the preceding story is told by my correspondent in so interesting a manner that i could not withhold it from the public this day and i not only agree with him in his remark that his misfortunes would all have been prevented by a proper education but i will add that a mind which supported itself so well under affliction and that can look back to former scenes of life with so much sensibility would have imbibed such impressions from an early improvement as might have rendered him an ornament to any family if many of those who find any striking incidents in the series of their lives would thus communicate them to the public it would be a very great service to society as it would serve to detect the ways of the world and might put the unwary upon their guard against illdesigning men there is something extremely affecting in the ruin of my correspondents four sisters but i am however highly pleased that he now enjoys a tranquillity of mind and that to alleviate calamity his resources are in virtue and honest industry i must observe that the inattention of the old gentleman who died at bristol to the manners and morals of his relations showed something in him highly illiberal not to give it a worse epithet and it is owing to this indifference to the improvement of the rising generation that we frequently see estates in the hands of those who are a disgrace to riches and while this continues to be the case it is not to be wondered that we meet with so many boobies of fashion inelegant in their behavior loose in their morals and fit to

honor our much admired shakespeare stands yet unrivalled he seized the laurel with a masterhand at one grasp johnson by slower degrees though eager in pursuit avidusque refringit cunctantem and otway seems to have gained it with facility  i am pleased to find that an author justly celebrated among the foremost successors of these immortal geniuss has added another wreath to that garland which the muses long since wove for him and in my opinion the public is greatly indebted to him for his new tragedy of the brothers which was lately acted for the first time at drury lane at the same time that i advance this i must observe that the subject of it is not perhaps as interesting to a british audience as a more domestic story and the generality of people not being acquainted with the history of that monarchy it thence results that the distress of the king of macedon does not engage our passions so forcibly as might be expected it may be added that the macedonians are supposed at that point of time to be at variance with the roman empire for which we have contracted a kind of reverential esteem and on this account those sublime sentiments which philip utters in the scene with the ambassadors against that republic are not received with a sufficient degree of warmth but if it be considered that the macedonian monarchy though it dwindled by insensible degrees and was at last swallowed up by the roman empire was at one time the most flourishing in europe i apprehend no man can be entirely unconcerned in the fall of so brave a people i do not doubt but the mention of cressi and poitiers would have a more powerful influence on the passions of englishmen than thrasymene and cannae but for my part my breast glowed to hear of those memorable battles which had like to have been so fatal to the roman republic nor do i remember a grander sentiment than that of philip when the flight of hannibal at capua is urged by the embassy of rome his answer is ay there indeed i was not with him the scene which succeeds this is full of as tender emotions as i have ever felt in any theater the anguish of the father to find a discord subsisting between his children and the remonstrance with which he endeavors to sooth them must soften the mind of every hearer  why do i sigh do ye not know my sons and if you do oh let me sigh no more let these white hairs put in a claim to peace perhaps no characters can be better marked than those of philip perseus and demetrius for the two last of which we are finely prepared by the following lines   they both are bright but one benignly bright as stars to mariners and one a comet with malignant blaze denouncing ruin the art of most writers for the stage is to exhibit one character and that perhaps without any distinguishing qualities to separate it from other heroes but in this play we are entertained with three of a different cast and each strongly marked philip is distinguished by a warmth of temper an haughtiness of soul and a tenderness for his children that runs over in the most affecting manner perseus is a different villain from any we have seen on the stage policy and bravery are so blended in him that we see their mixed effects in every scene and demetrius is of so amiable a disposition that an audience must be naturally inclined to love him and for his sake to dread the restless turbulent spirit of perseus whose contempt of demetrius vents itself in a sneering artful strain  you that admire the romans break the bridge with cocles or with curtius leap the gulf and league not with the vices of our foes i hear sir you take wing and mount in meter terence has owned your aid terence there the slave the invocation which is uttered by the same personage is carried on in a masterly manner filling the

contrast to the golden sun and spread around your pestilential blasts that wither every virtue in the bud while i transport ye etc it will be unnecessary to remind my readers of the trialscene which must inevitably fire the intelligent mind with a classic warmth i cannot help thinking that the author in this passage has given a just idea of the two different kinds of eloquence which prevailed in greece and rome  perseus enters immediately into the matter his sentences are strong and nervous and sure of convincing the understanding by the clearness of his diction he does not condescend to address the imagination it is true he at one time sheds tears but that is only to obviate the power of eloquence which he is aware might be used by his brother who having imbibed the art of roman oratory sets out in the most insinuating manner tries the avenues to the passions and endeavors to win his hearers by persuasion i am sensible that this beauty may escape the multitude but even without this secondary pleasure the scene cannot sail of striking every imagination  the distress of demetrius in the fourth and fifth act bears hard upon our affections and it must be a torture to every compassionate heart to see him undone by the artifices of villainy his speech when discovered in gaol has many affecting strokes ye dungeons deep ye subterranean caves guilts first sad stage in her dark path to hell receive a guest arrived from other scenes from pompous courts etc and when he lies dead on the ground philip delivers himself in noble language and very pathetic sentiments there philip fell  there macedon expired i see the roman eagle hovering over me and the shaft broke should bring her to the ground   i cannot conclude this paper without taking notice of the propensity which the small critics discovered at the representation of this piece to attach themselves to every trivial circumstance which could have the least tendency to excite their mirth and i must inform them that to be unsusceptible of manly emotions and at the same time to yield to the idle sensations of levity and giddy merriment is the sign of a little and frivolous mind  true intelligence from my

as my thoughts are entirely engrossed by an unhappy event which i am persuaded will affect your mind very greatly our once worthy friend jack  yesterday evening after having passed the time with his usual alacrity of spirit went home to his lodging and clapping a pistol in his mouth shot himself through the head the noise alarmed the family who instantly went up stairs and found him dead i shall write to you more at large very shortly and must beg leave for the present without adding any thing farther to subscribe myself  dear sir yours with great sincerity    the gloomy month of november being passed i imagined that the horrid crime of suicide would cease at least till the return of that heavy time of the year it is certainly a poor desertion from the dignity of our nature to suffer the pressure of the atmosphere or any other sublunary incident to make such an impression upon our spirits as to render us avowed enemies to ourselves i have heard a popular insurrection called an unnatural rebellion but by what name shall we stigmatize an action which flies in the face of our maker which dares to thwart the dispensations of the supreme being and say to eternal providence who from the first ordained all things for the best not thine but my will be done  it requires no profusion of imagery no bold daring metaphor no studied hyperbole to represent this piece of impiety in its proper colors it strikes the eye at once in its most flagrant atrocious dye and were it sufficiently attended to it would teach a due resignation to the determinations of heaven and would prevent all that train of evils from which any thinking mind must now start back appalled  if selfpreservation is the nearest principle to the heart of man what a perversion of our faculties of our reason and our judgment must usurp the mind of him who thus runs counter to the very end of his creation the dignity of the human soul is extinguished not only his power of reflection is suppressed but his very passions are thrown off their bias they are seduced from their original institution their nature use and end is perverted and what before sought real or apparent pleasure and avoided actual or imaginary pain now by a strange fatality seeks its own destruction anarchy and civil war disturb the imagination and the man bears his own secret enemy in his breast he forms a design upon his own life he has the air drawn dagger constantly before his eyes and he at length becomes his own macheth not even the bloody purposer of determined vengeance on anothers head horrid as the crime appears is half so astonishing because he does not carry with him half the absurdity the latter has time left him to atone by penitence for his barbarity whereas the suicide urges precipitantly to the tribunal of his offended god  the real source of this fatal evil is perhaps hard to be ascertained but if it is not originally an emanation from pride it is tinged with it so strongly that there is reason to conclude it is frequently derived from thence self love will always induce us to overrate our rank in the scale of beings and when once the imagination is struck with the idea of fancied importance each little trial of adversity is considered as a grievance intolerable it is too much for the man to bear he concludes himself a destined mark for affliction and rather than drag a feverish life under an huge load of misery he proudly resolves to put an end to his sufferings and measure out the thread of his own existence  for my own part i cannot look upon any contingence in this world of consequence sufficient to urge a man to this extreme of madness is he reduced to want by his inordinate expenses or do the narrowness of circumstances prevent him from emerging into that station of life which his ambition would aspire to  let him but examine the happiness of the affluent how many want with a full purse how many are tortured with diseases or eaten up with uneasy passions have a mans relations unworthily withdrawn their protection from him there are occupations enough in which he may endeavor to support himself without their assistance and then he will have the satisfaction of living independent of those who have deserted him and should he fail his honest indigence will at all times be a disgrace to them so that either way he will be a living affront to his false friends  in so polite an age it may not be proper to corroborate what has been advanced by arguments drawn from religion but if an heathen may have any weight in the affair i would inform the man of despair that plato and cicero were both of opinion that we are placed in this world as soldiers upon duty and that no one has a right to move without the summons of his commanding officer and virgil in the words of my motto tells us that there is a place of retribution for those unhappy wretches who dare to lay violent hands upon themselves and prodigal of life to precipitate their souls into eternity they would be glad continues the poet to bear poverty and the sharpest miseries could they again return to life but the fates forbid them and their passage is irremeable  to these authorities i would beg leave to add the sentiment of our great shakespeare who though he may be justly suspected of christianity was still a poet and therefore may be cited on this occasion he has introduced a young prince deliberating whether he should not extricate himself from the troubles of this world by boldly putting an end to his residence on this side of the grave the point is argued with great strength of reasoning the calamities of this life are thrown into the scale and after stating every thing in the most striking colors a prospect of futurity opens to the imagination and the mind starts back from the desperate act convinced that it is our duty to endure life and bear our portion with fortitude until heaven shall be pleased to put in execution that sentence of death which it has passed on all mankind  who would fardels bear to sweat and groan under a weary life but that the dread of something after death that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than to fly to others that we know not of true intelligence to charles ranger esquire sir from a motive of gratitude and for the benefit of my countrymen in general i beg leave through the channel of your paper to communicate the disorder i have been for some time afflicted with and the traordinary cure i lately met with i have had for many months successively a flow nervous fever with a constant flutter on my spirits attended with pertinacious watchings twitchings of the nerves and other grievous symptoms which reduced me to a mere shadow at length a friend who had himself experienced it advised me to have recourse to the reading of the inspectors papers i accordingly took one of them over night and the consequence was i fell into a profound sleep which lasted near six and thirty hours since that i have been ordered for fear of a lethargy to take them in smaller quantities a paragraph at a time now answers my purpose and under heaven i owe my sleeping faculties to the abovementioned inspector i look upon them to be a grand soporificum mirabile proper to be had in all families he makes great allowance to those who buy

visit to a lady for whom i have always had a very great respect an excursion which she made into the country was the occasion of my not having seen her for some time but upon the first notice of her being in town i immediately did myself the favor of waiting on her it was with great satisfaction that i perceived her complexion florid to the highest degree of health as i knew she had two sons at eton school i enquired after the young gentlemen and received for answer that the brats were minding their books boys mr ranger said she are best when out of ones way  they make such a noise in an house that there is really no such thing as bearing with them  i hope they are going on well  but sir you dont know all my family upon this she rung the bell and ordered the servant to bring down miss lucy and miss charlotte and then continued mrs bizarre they are both quite jealous of one another miss lucy has taken a notion into her head that charlotte is my favorite and charlotte equally suspects my propensity to lucy  but upon my word it is without foundation i give them no manner of reason  well now i think it would be quite wrong in me to make any difference when they are both deserving  i vow and protest i love them both alike  i cannot think how some folks can be so  to be sure it is very commonly the cause of great uneasiness in a family and the little things are unhappy in their minds  lard i wonder what keeps them above so long  when on a sudden the parlour door was thrown open and as i did not recollect that mrs bizarre had any daughters i advanced with some degree of impatience to salute the young ladies but to my great surprise the maid introduced to me two very ugly monkeys dressed out in the nicest manner with paris caps and well chosen petonlair and petticoat  the disappointment i met with flung me into some confusion and i retired back in a very awkward manner to my chair there mr ranger reassumed the lady this is miss lucy and this is miss charlotte  pray sir dont you think they have very pretty turned faces  there is a family likeness between them i think  they are the only comfort i have  pray molly did miss lucy take the manna as the doctor ordered  lord i was frighted out of my wits yesterday the poor thing was so terribly pained with the cholic  and miss charlotte has been coughing all the morning i hope it will not fall upon her lungs  they are the sweetest creatures in the world  where is your curtsey miss when a gentleman speaks to you  she is absolutely mr ranger the greatest prude in london  she quarrels with the maid

finest teeth  i am afraid she is a little inclined to be sat  she will never be taller  lard mr ranger i wish i could get her a husband i should be glad to see her well settled  he he he  now i have a queer notion in my head  do you know that i have a husband in my eye for her  guess who it is  to this i took occasion to answer that there are really so many pretty gentlemen about town that it would be absolutely impossible for me to form a right conjecture and i therefore begged she would be so kind as to inform me why sir replied she there is tom titmouse that is always biting his lips and never has a bit of his shoe seen above his buckle and billy wirewig who always stinks of perfume or jemmy doll with the delicate complexion and the little mincing step but it is not any of them  o fie

ever at mother midnights  to be sure you was he he he  well for certain i am a comical woman  you remember the pretty dear creature that sits at supper on the right hand  he he he it came into my mind the moment i saw the dear fellow that it would be a good match and so now as i dont know where to send i have drawn up an advertisement which i intend to put into the papers  here you may read it sir  this i complied with it was in substance as follows  if the monkey that sat on the right hand at mother midnights and drank a glass of wine after bowing to the company has no aversion to matrimony he is desired to call at mayfair chapel and he will hear of something to his advantage  upon perusal of this extraordinary advertisement i endeavored to expostulate with the good lady on the oddity of her proceeding and i remonstrated that it would appear to the world the most whimsical thing that was ever practiced irritated at this mrs bizarre could not bear to be touched in so tender a point and she told me with some vehemence that monkeys have often more sense than many of the human species and i believe the dispute would have rose high between us had not an accident put an end to it  while we were engaged in conversation a quarrel happened between the two young ladies and in a moment miss lucy tore off miss charlottes cap which compliment was returned in kind and then the battle was carried on with great eargerness on both sides attended with violent screamings with bouncing about the room leaping on chairs and tables and flying violently in our faces all the ornaments on the mantlepiece were broke to shatters the china figures which before seemed to breathe and think came trembling down woodward and mrs clive who represented in exquisite chelseaware their different

this strange scene with the utmost expedition and as soon as i found myself in my chambers i could not help reflecting on the whimsical turn of mind which disposed this lady to fix her heart on such a disagreeable race of animals when a woman becomes an apostate from the laws of nature and divests herself of the proper ornaments of her sex she is as great an exotic as any in her collection of wild beasts i believe the pangs of jealousy would be much keener in an husbands breast were he to find himself rivalled by a monkey and for such a set of odious creatures to see a person neglect her own children is so fantastical a circumstance that some of my readers may perhaps think the existence of such a character improbable but i can assure them that there are frequent instances of it in this

small ribs of a third and if i proceed in this manner i begin to be apprehensive about the consequences which may arise from unforeseen accidents and therefore i am now determined to entrench myself from insults within one of the resolutions which i entered into upon the commencement of this paper viz not to deserve ill of any man  it would be well if all the individuals of society would enter into a reciprocal agreement of observing the same principle in their deportment we might then see that harmony subsist which as sociable beings it is our business to promote this would banish all surly moroseness and in short this single rule of deserving i will from no man would prevent all indecorums and animosities and substitute in their room mutual considence and goodbreeding  but the contrary occurs every day and seems to be derived from no other source than a vicious gratification of our private humors a selfish spirit is condemned in ethics as the cause of many vices and it is of no less evil influence in the petites morales or lesser morals when a narrow regard to a mans own sensations gains the ascendant and none will recede from their equal right of having their own way it is not to be wondered that ill humors should sour the temper and that frequent quarrels should arise  philipsus has taken it into his head that to be brisk and shining in conversation is the most elegant accomplishment he can aspire to and therefore has spent most of his time in the acquirement of something that he calls wit but in the eyes of men of sense is only a petulant pertness very annoying to his company philipsus has laid it down as a maxim that he must upon all occasions display his favorite talent and would rather at any time lose his friend than his joke antiphaus is an absolute enemy to all pretensions to be shining conversation with him must be in a plain sensible manner he will neither give nor take a joke hence these two are constantly at variance and it is imagined by their friends that the affair must be at last decided behind montaguehouse  for my part i have often wondered how men can be such enemies to their pleasures as to be thus obstinately bent on the indulgence of their own private whimsies without abating any thing from their pretensions in order to contribute to the felicity of their neighbors the social passions afford more real delight than any selfish gratifications the latter are sure to occasion a narrowness of spirit while the former expand the faculties of the mind and receive addition from being communicated like the sun painting the hemisphere with streaks of light which serve to adorn his way and augment the glory of his career in a state of mutual dependence which nature has allotted to us all it is not to be imagined that any one will pay the least deference to our ease and happiness unless in our turn we recede a little from our own humors and purchase by our deportment that complacence which every one desires to meet with in his intercourse with society  but as this restraint upon our conduct seems to be too much thrown off it is not to be wondered that frequent recourse is had to duelling to decide differences between those who have renounced the guidance of reason which would surely forbid us to squander away the life  bestowed upon us by the supreme being upon such trivial incidents as for the most part occasion these extremities the romans knew nothing of this modern practice which is entirely of french growth and like many of the fashions of that country should be exploded from all civilized nations it may not be improper to cite the definition of courage from so fine a gentleman as mr addison in his elegant poem entitled the campaign he tells us true courage dwells not in a troubled flood of mounting spirits and fermenting blood lodged in the soul by virtue overruled insiamd by reason and by reason ccold i never yet heard of an affair between two gentlemen according to the polite phrase but one or both of them was egregiously in the wrong and i persuade myself that if indead of determining wilfully to support matters of no moment people could be brought to canvass their differences with some degree of temper and cheerfulness we should not often have advices from morybone fields or any of the usual scenes of action upon these occasions to evince this i shall conclude with the following story i was once in company at a tavern with a set of gentlemen when after much mirth and festivity one of the party who had been silent almost the whole night accosted a gentleman who had contributed greatly to our entertainment by a lively vein of fancy peculiar to him in the following words sir says he taking him by the button i have something to communicate to you  i have observed sir  that you have been very facetious all night  you have run your rig upon me sir and so  i desire you will meet me tomorrow morning in pancras buryingground  a blood of the town would perhaps have been fired at this proposal but my friend received it with great composure and while the rest of the company were struck dumb at the solemnity of the challenge he turns to him with a mixture of jest and earnest in his countenance and whispers in pancras burying ground sir yes sir in pancras burying ground without fail  very well sir  must i bring my shroud with me  the pleasantry of this question excited a general laugh in the room and the solemn gentleman could not resist the impulse of mirth he joined in the chorus and as soon as he recovered from his fit of merriment exclaimed youre a brave boy  give us your hand  i will never meet you but on a party of pleasure and to that you may command me whenever you please  true intelligence drury lane april   this

when they have vanished and disappeared makes fond excursions after them again and even in our sleep it will occasionally recall the objects of our waking reflection and from thence receive livelier sensations than were perhaps occasioned by the first impression though there are many fantastic circumstances in these night thoughts if i may be so allowed to call our dreams yet on these occasions we sometimes find ourselves presented with agreeable visions and amidst the wildest vagaries of fancy we can often trace something like just reasoning and a real picture of life as i take this to have been the case with me a few nights since i shall make no apology for throwing my dream upon paper this day  i found myself on a sudden near a large intricate wood which i had the curiosity to enter a whimsical band of hope and fear joy and grief pain and pleasure hovered over our heads tender anguish soft desire pleasing agony were all intermixed and in their motley livery formed a manycoloured groupe cupid made violent work with his darts and flames and nothing was to be heard but tinkling rills falling fountains and lovesick sighs by which the aspen leaves were perpetually kept in a rustling tremor the god of love had by him a prodigious quantity of arrows differently feathered according to the various effects of which they were to be productive this circumstance called to my mind a beautiful passage in a poem by doctor parnell  and every dart can boast a kind which suits each proper turn of mind from the towering eagles plume the generous hearts accept their doom shot by the peacocks painted eye the vain and airy lovers die for careful dames and frugal men the shafts are speckled by the hen the pyes and parrots deck the darts when prattling wins the panting hearts when from the voice the passions spring the warbling finch affords a wing together by the sparrow stung down fall the wanton and the young and fledged by geese the weapons fly when others love they know not why it was not unpleasant to observe the variety of impressions that were occasioned in both sexes by this strange flight of arrows men i perceived in close pursuit of blooming virgins merely from the impulse of vanity and i saw several nymphs running with the utmost precipitation from their lovers though by their manner of looking back and the rustling they made in the trees there was room for conjecture that they did not desire entirely to escape  pleasing as the sensations of love are i could observe that very unhappy effects were often the consequences many there were whose mien spoke a dejection of spirits and they were frequently driven to such extremes that they laid violent hands on their own lives as i traveled on i saw several hanging on bows of trees and on the waters which were swelled with tears and ruffled with sighs floated many a pallid corpse in their countenances i could plainly see the traces of that sickly luxury of thought which is so apt to settle into a fixed despair  from this scene of distress i turned away as soon as possible and was relieved from my uneasiness by the sight of a few who seemed to be happy in their passion whose hearts felt a mutual warmth and whose eyes were brightened into gladness they walked arm in arm down the flowery meads interchanging mutual glances of affection though ever and anon succeeded anger suspicion open war and peace again in the center of the wood stood a temple sacred to virtue where all who were desirous of leading a life of happiness were directed to bend their course in order there to be united together in bands of chaste affection i was sorry to find that some of the ladies had not resolution to persevere in this path whether it was owing to loose desires or seducing temptation i cannot decide certain it is they tired in their journey and stepped aside with their paramours to sequestered bowers from whence they were afterward discarded into the thorny parts of the wood for the remainder of their days but even of these a few there were who after their digression still found means to be introduced into the temple whither they were however pursued by an old hag called scandal who never yet has been known to let them entirely efface the remembrance of their error  the ladies who kept on a due course never failed to lead the men in captivity after them to the temple from whence after a short ceremony they were dismissed in pairs to commence the road for life three different paths were open to their choice and a guide stood at each entrance to receive them the first was of a cold dispassionate temper who took every thing alike and his name was indifference the second had eyes of a greenish cast and he seemed to loath the food which he notwithstanding eagerly swallowed this personage was called jealousy and the third by an openness of countenance a strong expression of quick sensibility and cordial affection was known to be friendship too many gave themselves up to indifference and instantly an inattention to each others wants succeeded in their breasts the men betook themselves to midnight shouts and revelry and the fair to parties of tea and routs and drums by which means every spark of love was soon extinguished and the gratification of their own separate inclinations was their only study  the walks of jealousy were craggy dangerous and steep full of thorns briars and brambles in the heart where before gladness and joy revelled secure arose anxiety distrust and perturbation of spirit the distempered fancy started at scenes of its own creation and in a fit of madness hurried many a tortured wretch down the precipice of fate or let fall its vengeance on its neighbor what was observable in this part was that though sometimes there were the appearances the real footsteps of guilt could no where be discovered  the very small number under the guidance of friendship enjoyed a pure heartfelt tranquillity and the fierce desire and impatient wish which had formerly actuated their minds having now subsided a steady and uniform flame succeeded not unlike the mild refreshing air of a placid evening after the fervor of an hot summers day glad suns rose over their heads and kindly nights lulled them in each others arms a smiling race grew up around them and the culture of their young and tender minds afforded a pleasing employment they journeyd on through life blessed with the sunshine of the soul till at length the easy dissolution of nature put a period to all human felicity  here i could not help exclaiming with

inter nubila condit virgil there are few terms which are applied with greater impropriety than those characteristical appellations which men usually bestow on their acquaintance or on others in whose company and conversation they may at any time have been casually engaged every character indeed is formed by the prevalence of some particular passion which influences the temper and gives a casting weight to the genius of the person in whom it subsists but no rules that i know of have been yet laid down nor is there any certain standard which should fix the degree of elevation to which the ruling passion must necessarily rise before it can have strength sufficient to determine the character  the reader must however be informed that i am not speaking of those moral qualifications or endowments of the heart which speculative writers have taken so much idle pains to adorn and recommend and which men of sense or men of the world have unanimously agreed in rejecting as unworthy of their serious notice the qualities i mean are pure virtues of the head or face properties which enable the possessor to assume a solemn aspect at incidents which set the rest of the table on a roar or to interrupt what is truly serious and grave by impertinent questions of levity and mirth or lastly to condemn and cavil when all the world sees the highest reasons for applause and admiration the effects which these causes produce in life however various and complicated in their appearance may be reduced to the three general sources of wit humor and criticism and as the pretenders to these several qualities are infinite in number i have determined on a certain standard in order to regulate and adjust their claims the method i propose is to decide their different pretensions by the height and stature of the body  and lest this should be considered as a wild chimerical design i must beg leave to assure my reader that the theory i am forming is built upon the latest discoveries and most uncontroverted principles of true philosophy it is possible however that persons of an overrefining curiosity may be able to raise some objections to what i am going to advance but as every thing is liable to be called in question by those who are disposed to cavil they will give me but little pain upon that head the plainest truths have been disputed and the most extravagant opinions have been fortunate enough to meet with their advocates and admirers now i would have such people recollect what are the general apprehensions arising in the mind on the sight of an uncommon stature and how favorable withal even the notions of the vulgar are to an unusual height of person is it not commonly supposed that men of this superior eminence possess as superior parts and extraordinary degrees of merit from this principle my little friend of drury lane is universally censured as falling short of a true hero by near half a foot whilst his more aspiring antagonist is allowed to have all the necessary dimensions required both by ancient and modern precedents to constitute the heroic character  it is an axiom in philosophy which few i hope will be so hardy as to deny that the soul is all and all in every part from hence it is obvious that the body which is a covering only for the aetherial particle that is lodged within it must necessarily receive its dimensions from the vigor of the spirit which actuates the exterior frame the greater portion of fire this spirit is endued with its elastic qualities will be proportionably stronger and the dimensions of the body will be protruded to a size exactly of the same dimensions with the soul which informs it on this simple hypothesis which i imagine cannot be easily disproved i proceed to settle the respective qualifications of the different pretenders who have been mentioned above  in the first place those who with gentle william in the play boast themselves not on account of their wisdom but as they have a pretty wit do not exceed the lowest degree of our appointed standard it is not in nature that such persons can rise in their stature above the height of five feet and six inches for wit which is merely an exercise of the tongue does not require the same bulk and dimensions which are essential to qualifications of a superior order it is evidently a much less exertion of the interior faculties than what are productive of that talent which we call humor hence we must advance a little in our standard and can admit no one to be a man of real humor who does not come up to the full height of five feet and eight inches and this small progression is the more allowable as a considerable part of humor is frequently expressed by such feats of body as require some little degree of size and strength giving a friend a violent and unexpected slap upon the back or the dexterous leaping over chairs and tables have been often regarded as so many undoubted signs of genuine humor and are generally agreed to denote a most facetious vein of pleasantry in the authors of such exquisite jokes it will sometimes further happen that these two qualities may be blended in the same person as i doubt not but many of my readers can recollect several of their acquaintance who are your only men of wit and humor now this conjunction manifestly implies a much superior energy of soul and consequently a still higher advancement in our scale of characteristic excellencies these candidates for fame will accordingly rise two inches above those who are mentioned last and none are to pass under this denomination for the future but whose height is five feet ten for these qualities when thus united will frequently exert themselves in strokes of gallantry and mirth which are so much the more honorable as they are dangerous to the person or the purse of the ingenious artist who has the courage or curiosity to attempt the experiment the demolishing of windows knocking down of watchmen bilking of waiters at places of entertainment with other instances of the like kind are very laudable and convincing proofs of these compound qualities residing together in the same habitation the last quality which greatly overtops the rest and is indeed the crown and perfection of all is the wonderful and most ingenious faculty of modern criticism and as this is in the most exalted manner the gift of nature whoever has the happiness to be born a true critic is at least six feet complete a critic is the masterpiece and noblest work of nature and may justly be expected to bear about him some distinguishing tokens which will enable a spectator at the first view to acknowledge and revere his merits hence she has bestowed on him a more than ordinary portion of the daring and tremendous and these would appear to very little effect in a person of less dimensions than those which we have here assigned him the wit may be pert and sanguine the man of humor confident or overbearing but it is the critic alone who glares horribly terrific his every look freezes the young authors blood and at the sound of his voice the rooted seats have been known to be torn from the ground and hurled violently through the air in furious and wild commotion phenomenon like these can only be produced by that iron strength of lungs and brazen audacity of figure which nature has so liberally imparted to the modern critic  it will be necessary to obviate an objection arising from popular prejudice that the science of criticism being to examine into the merit of all productions of genius and learning it does not seem to demand the size and dimensions which i have made essential to the character but the objectors i apprehend are mistaken in the end of modern criticism and have not perhaps duly reflected on the necessary qualities to discharge the province they are desirous of allotting it to execute that task would require a moderate portion of sense taste and judgment under the direction of modesty and candor talents so little practiced by those who have taken up the occupation of a a critic that they appear on all occasions not to have the least conception of them whoever will give himself leave to consider that the character of a critic a wit and man of humor in the present estimation of the world is supported wholly by mechanical operations in which the understanding has no manner of share he will easily agree with me that the surest method to discover those characters must be taken from that part which is principally concerned and as we can truly judge from outward appearances alone i have shown to a demonstration that the stature of a person is the only infallible criterion by which we can decide on the justness of his pretensions and that no one for the future can have any right to either of those characters but whose dimensions will exactly tally with the measures of this standard  true intelligence bedford coffeehouse mr ranger gives public notice that he will shortly issue his edict for a general show or appearance of all the critics wits and men of humor within this metropolis and five miles round it the place of rendezvous will be the piazzas in covent garden and he

this measurement and afterward he is to be reputed accordingly the name of every person will be carefully entered in a register to be kept at the said coffeehouse to which every man will have the liberty of appealing in case of a dispute mr ranger out of consideration to the circumstances of the said critics etc generously remits his own fees and requires only one shilling to be given his

graysinngardens i withdrew to the edifice raised by the great sir francis bacon where i scarce had seated myself when i perceived an elderly gentleman hastening toward me he was of a ruddy hale complexion but had the air of one somewhat disconcerted in his mind scraping the ground with one leg drawn backwards and holding out his hat at arms length he hesitated a desire to know if i was mr ranger the entertaining writer upon answering him in the affirmative with regard to the name and at the same time expressing some doubt about the compliment made to me as an author the gentleman immediately looked grave and shaking his head aye sir says he you are the very man i want  i must be a little troublesome to you for your advice in an affair that weighs heavily on my spirits and a friend has advised me to apply to mr ranger for his opinion  upon this i assured him of my inclination to serve him and as i perceived he had not yet divested himself of his diffidence i begged of him to proceed without any farther ceremony which he accordingly complied with  my name sir reassumed the stranger is oldcastle of oldcastlehall in the north of england  nothing but an affair of consequence should have brought me upwards of two hundred miles to town  i have fetched my eldest son up with me as i think of putting him to something  a wounded sharp boy he is  he is a tartar for your greek and your latin and the best mimick in the world  odds my life he would mimick all the waggoners as he come along the road  but that is neither here nor there  i now think it time as i told you to put him to business  i have a large family and but a final estate was handed to me by my ancestors  the land was surveyed in the time of queen elizabeth and there is just the same number of acres to this day  i would have my son be the first of his family that improved it and then he may help me to provide for his brother and sisters  but look ye sir in this large town i am mainly puzzled what to put him to  i am afraid i have made such another journey to london as sir francis wronghead in the play and unless some such good gentleman as you assists me i must go back in the old squeaking stagecoach without doing my business  if you please i will step and fetch dicky he is at the bull and gate inn and will be here in a crack here he paused for a reply as the matter he consulted me upon was of no small importance i begged leave to be silent for the present and promised i would give him an answer in this days lucubration mr oldcastle was perfectly satisfied and withdrew in the fullness of his joy after assuring me that he would always read my paper and that he would leave orders with the publisher to send it to his house in the country every saturday for the future  the direction of a young gentlemans genius to any particular profession is a point of more consequence than perhaps appears to the inattentive as to this step is often to be imputed the happiness or misery of the person in the ensuing part of his days this circumstance in life is not unlike what we see at a bowlinggreen where before a man plays off he should consider the bias of his bowl and if it is delivered with judgment it makes its way to the destined point but if there should be too much rapidity in the outset or if a proper degree of force should be wanting to forward it it either runs beyond the mark or lags in the middle of its progress on this account it is no easy matter to advise upon so delicate a point as i have now to handle  i have considered all the professions and i really think them very precarious many great estates and eminent titles have been derived from the law but it is now reduced to such a state that without very great friends a person possessed of the talents of a murray shall never rise to any degree of eminence with regard to physic a genius may spend his time in saving the lives of patients in garrets and doing real services to mankind without any emolument to himself while doctor slaughter puts his license to kill in execution upon thousands of his majestys welldisposed subjects and lolls at ease in his chariot  in the army it is to be feared that preferment goes more by interest than merit and there is not a wind that can blow from any quarter of the heavens but fills the merchants imagination with pictured scenes of shipwrecks and while he breaks the seal of a letter he trembles for fear of receiving the news of some correspondents failure the stage indeed seems to be a place where merit meets its reward but even there there are great disadvantages and though a genius should start up with the talents of a garrick and person of a barry it is odds but his eye is one time or other knocked out by a well directed apple  there is however a way of life which i cannot help thinking the most eligible and not to keep the reader any longer in suspense the occupation i mean is that of a gamester after mature deliberation the gentlemen of this calling seem to me to be in possession of greater advantages than any of the others and the inconveniences attending them are not upon a balance with the conveniences  a gamester from a constant habit of venturing large sums upon the turning up of a card or a die acquires that thorough disregard for money which is so much recommended by the philosophers like catiline in sallust he is alieni appetens sui profusis at the same time that he is desirous of his friends substance he has the pleasure of being profuse in his own private gratifications instead of creeping through life with that mediocrity of spirit which depresses the man of business the gamester lives with an eclat ryan venable or tomkyns supply him with his wines and he is every hour gaining an insight into men and manners as rude health has too much of the country in it and of course is not very pleasing to the ladies he acquires by his midnight vigil a pallid meagre countenance which generally denotes an intimate knowledge of the town and while others deceive one another in the face of day a gamester has the modesty to fly to the covert of the night and if i may use the poets words the pale moon and stars alone are conscious of the theft while the man of genius is left undisturbed in his study the gaydressed footman knocks at the gamesters doos and leaves the agreeable card to invite him to my lady bragwells there he has an opportunity of carrying on a design upon a ladys money and virtue at the same time and if he can once contrive to get her in his books he sinds it no difficult matter to make her give personal security and when once a womans body is mortgaged there is no equity of redemption  there are many other conveniences annexed to a life of play and therefore i would have my friend mr oldcastle train up his son to this profession and to encourage all beginners in this way i shall dismiss this paper with only one article of true intelligence which i take to be of the utmost consequence to all such adventurers  true intelligence to the public lately arrived in this town from paris the marquis de fourberie well known to many of the nobility and gentry who have been in foreign parts he is well versed in all the different branches of gaming and he teaches how to play the whole game in a months time  he has taken an apartment for this purpose in the haymarket where he reads lectures every day in the week except wednesday when he attends the gentlemen of the city at his room near the royal exchange where he will let any young prentice or city smart into the secret without hindrance of business  he has taught since his coming here several gamesters of both sexes and it was he instructed the scaramouch who carried off fifteen hundred pounds from the last masquerade  gentlemen and ladies may learn in a private manner without being overseen by strangers while learning and for the more expeditiously completing them there is a set to practice from seven in the evening till three in the morning  as several persons have and do think still that it is impossible to learn without going into company he thinks proper to inform them of his method for that purpose he first teaches the scholar the shuffle then the different methods of cutting next he explains his rules by the assistance of secondhand cards when the party is so qualified he makes his own family sit down with them where they play most of the games in vogue after the person has learned in this manner which he or she may do in a very short time he dares answer for them they will be qualified to play in any genteel company whatever  jacta est alea  n b the marquis had not a stitch of clothes when he began and he now shines away with his dresden ruffles and diamond ring such persons as are desirous to learn any branch excessive quick may come twice or thrice a day or lodge and board in the house for the time he insures for a small praemium one thousand pounds a year to any ingenious young gentleman who will make himself master of his rules he sells dice for gentlemen to carry in their pockets  numb    graysinn saturday may        ausus non operam non formidare poetae nomen adoratum quondam nunc paene procaci monstratum digito  praedium rusticum derision and contempt have been for many ages the portion of most authors whom rank in life or superiority of abilities have not eminently raised above the common herd of their fraternity and the name of poet in every company where the word is mentioned is sure to excite ludicrous ideas of garrets unwashed shirts and unpaid tailors by these means it has obtained that younger brothers had rather take a pistol or a pack of cards in their hands to raise a livelihood than endeavor to help out the years income by the exertion of their talents dreading the infamy of wit more than any other imputation that can be fixed upon their characters  this effect is not produced without a concurrence of many efficient causes among which the principal one is the known poverty of the generality of the tribe that write and among all the inconveniences of indigence it has been well said that there is not a greater hardship than that ridicule which it brings upon those who labor under its lash  nil habit infaelix paupertas durius in se quam quod ridiculos homines facit  the belly has been often called the teacher of art and the inspirer of wit but i apprehend this maxim can only be understood of a full belly  satur est cum dicit horatius evoe horace was warmed with good cheer when he calls out to bacchus to spare him says juvenal and the same author adds with an elegant vein of pleasantry that fine writing is the production of an exalted mind free from the solicitude of procuring a blanket and that if virgil wanted a lodging and a boy to attend him the snakes would fall from the fury which he so admirably describes and the trumpet would not sound to war with so shrill a clangor nam si virgilio puer and tolerabile deesset hospitium caderent omnes a crinibus hydri surda nibil gemeret grave buccina  it is not therefore to be wondered that poverty should diminish the poets luster since it not only renders him an object of contempt but extinguishes the fire of his genius and such is the fate or perverseness of authors that to circumstances which they cannot remove they are industrious to add many of their own creating so true is the saying of mr congreve that wherever wit is it is always contriving its own ruin the race of writers are extremely irascible prone to malice and envy toward the man whom they perceive in possession of fame and instead of endeavoring to equal him with an honest emulation their aim is to snatch the laurel from his brow or if they cannot reach it to wither it on his head by the bitter blasts of calumny and detraction voltaire delivers himself on this topic with so much delicacy and good sense that i shall here translate the passage it is a disgrace says he to the human mind that the republic of letters should be infested with personal resentments private cabals and mean intrigues which should only subsist among the slaves of fortune what advantage can accrue to authors from this civil war their animosities have no other tendency than to depreciate a profession which it is in their power to render respectable why should the art of thinking finely the greatest blessing man can share from heaven become an object of ridicule it is really hard that men of genius should render themselves by their mutual invectives the sport of pools and instead of being revered as the masters and instructors of the public turn out the buffoons and zanies of the town  there is another reason which contributes strongly to bring a disreputation upon poets and that is their mean and prostitute servility to a set of men whom they call their patrons these gentlemen are for the most part eager after praise and careless of the means by which they might obtain an honest fame hence the parnassian incense is extremely grateful and is therefore profusely offered up by every scribbling fool who vainly thinks to wriggle himself into preferment but the misfortune is that what happens in this case is not answerable to the writers intention his patron plumes himself upon the imputed accomplishments and glows with rapture and self admiration while for the bard he feels no passion but contempt and the rest of the world with pleasure behold infamy and disappointment the rewards of venality and prostitution  as i have always entertained great good wishes for the gentlemen of the quill i have devised a method by the observance of which they will be able to retrieve in some measure the honor of their calling and obviate that torrent of contumely which at present bears hard upon them  in the first place i would have them frequently inculcate that fortune is only the deity of fools and if she has not been favorable to them they had better enjoy a virtuous independence in private than by an ambitious poverty bring themselves under the contempt and ridicule of the affluent  secondly instead of wasting paper in mutual calumny and detraction i would recommend to them to vent their anger upon the critics or the malevoli a species of people highly prejudicial to the cause of literature on whom no severities can be too hard as it is notorious that not one of the race about town at present is any way fit for the province he has usurped a total ignorance of the learned languages and a lamentable want of taste together with a plentiful share of spleen and ill nature being the distinguishing characteristics of the whole tribe  thirdly and lastly i would advise my brother writers to dispense their panegyric with a little more reserve and always with an eye to truth from whence it will follow that they will find themselves more courted by their patrons and their butlers will the more readily condescend to hear them from the sideboard to maintain a poets dignity and ease is a beautiful sentiment of mr pope and his life and manners show that he carried it from theory into fractice who is not delighted to hear him declare with a noble pride enough for half the greatest of these days to scape my censure not expect my praise whenever i reflect upon the conduct of that great genius i find it hard to determine within myself which holds most of admiration the fineness of his perceptions and the elegance of his poetry or that grace of character and that unprostituted dignified independence which will always do honor to the man doctor swift likewise with less delicacy of manners jealously preserved his own respect and sure i am that the writings of these two great

additional delight from numberless adventitious circumstances to the association of ideas explained by mr lock may also be added the association of passions which reciprocally awaken each other and agitate the mind with their mixed operation thus the primary effect which any object or landscape may have on a persons taste is heightened and enlarged beyond its bounds a recollection of collateral images starts upon the fancy the passions pour in their auxiliar influence and our joy is increased by several sensations at once like a river which admits at different inlets the tributary illapse of several lesser streams and thence swelled above its banks dispenses verdure and fertility to all the country round that this is the case in many situations of the mind will be obvious to any body that will but turn his eyes inwards and i believe it is not more so in any one instance than the joy we seel from the opening of the spring  in my opinion we are not acquainted with a more complicated pleasure our love of novelty which is a leading principle in the heart of man implanted in us for the most benevolent purposes by the author of our frame is particularly gratified at this season of the year the appearance which things assume is not only pleasing to us on account of its natural beauty but also from its newness to the eye during the winter all nature seems to suffer a melancholy distress the animal creation droops their spirits seem sunk into dumb despair and we read their languid situation in the mute imploring eye the vegetable world seems also tending to decay and a general scene of calamity overspreads the face of nature from this state to see gradually a new creation emerging and every thing reviving with renovated vigor cannot fail of pleasing our imagination the whole race of animal life feels the genial influence of the soft season from a turbulence of clouds and all the inclemencies of the elements the scene is shifted to enlivening suns blue skies hills clothed with verdure imbowering shades refreshing streams and the harmony of the grove  the learned reader will perceive with what elegance virgil has described this vernal delight in the words of my motto the passage from whence i have selected these lines is carried on with an air of enthusiasm he seems particularly fond of this season and the whole is closed with a moral reflection on the providence of the supreme being who placed this part of the year as a medium to render the transition from intense cold to the heat of the summer less perceptible to our constitutions there are many short sketches of this nature in the same author we frequently find him casting a side glance this way and i will venture to say every reader of taste must have been greatly delighted with these

so often taken occasion to introduce  besides the obvious pleasures of this season already mentioned there is another circumstance which still renders it more delightful the spring more particularly than any other time of the year is the season of love at this juncture we feel the sun warm at our hearts young health smiles in the virgins eye the morn or evening walks affords sensations unfelt before a pleasing stillness runs over the faculties of the mind and every thing conspires to fill the heart with what the poet calls the spirit of love and amorous delight by love i would not be supposed to mean a mere gross impulse of passion but that elegance of desire that refinement of taste which distinguishes the gentleman and never fails of being acceptable to the amiable sex  whatever may be rattled over a bottle at a tavern we are obliged to the ladies for the most valuable gratifications of our lives and after all our highboasted reason and our superior abilities to them it is owing that our manners become more gentle and our sentiments acquire a finer polish our looks and gestures assume from them a molder air our passions soften into harmony and joy and the man who has used himself to this agreeable converse is acquainted with a thousand delicacies in his amusements and several elegancies in his way of thinking to which vulgar souls are absolutely strangers  instead

is with unspeakable pleasure i have observed for a considerable time past that those unhappy divisions which have been the bane of society ever since the late commotions in the north are in a great measure reconciled at least so far as to make an intercourse between people of different political sentiments not altogether impracticable the distinction of whig or jacobite seems to be at present thought not essentially necessary toward constituting a good companion and the word honest appears to have acquired a more enlarged signification insomuch that whenever we honor a man with that appellation it is generally understood that we mean something more than a person who is ready to drink a certain set of toasts in short the enthusiasm of party in this respect is so far abated that one may spend a cheerful evening with some of the most sanguine friends to the government without dedicating a single glass to the memory of king william and i have more than once within these last six months sat with some reputed wellwishers to the exiled family without being under a necessity of ungartering my stockings and pulling off my wig at every return of the bottle but alas what avails this coalition the spirit of party is so intimately interwoven in the constitution of an englishman that all attempts to extinguish it must inevitably fail of success it may indeed be diverted but will not admit of being eradicated  the truth of this observation is sufficiently manifested by the two powerful factions which now disunite this great metropolis  i could wish for the pen of bolingbroke in order to trace the rise and progress of those fatal dissensions which sow discord in families make breaches among friends embitter society and if not timely restrained threaten danger to the state  the reader i believe has anticipated me and plainly sees that i can mean no other than the sects distinguished by the denomination of garrickeans and barryists  the several pretensions of the theatrical leaders from whom the names of distinction just mentioned are derived are so extremely difficult to be adjusted that two persons can hardly be found within the cities of london and westminster who persectly agree in their way of thinking upon this head and as the amiable sex generally support with great impetuosity their favorite principles it is inconceivable to those who have not had opportunity of observing it what feuds and animosities prevail among the female partisans of these heroes  i was lately present at a controversy between two ladies who had adopted opposite sentiments the one being a garrickean and the other a barryist the dispute began in form  the garrickean insisting upon it that she did not like barry and the barryist protesting with equal emphasis that she could not so highly admire garrick  thus mutual contradiction being given the debate soon grew warm and the garrickean lady enforced her opinion with great vehemence there is something so clever something so lively something so i dont know how in garrick  and his eyes sparkle so that to be sure he is the sweetest creature in the world  her antagonist withstood this torrent of eloquence and with no less energy replied  nay madam if you talk of eyes nobody can say but barry has as lovely eyes as ever were seen  then he is so tall and so fine a man that lord bless me there is no comparison  i am sure garrick cannot make love so well  come now you must give that up  not i upon my honor maem resumes the garrickean why should i give it up all the gentlemen and you must allow they know best say garrick is the finest romeo  the weight of this reasoning piqued the barryist and she exclaimed with no small appearance of indignation  pshaw what signifies what the men say i dont mind it a farthing  they envy the dear man because he is so handsome  the earnestness and resentment with which this was delivered excited a general laugh and the ladies had prudence enough to suspend the contest for that evening but i have been since informed that they renewed it the next day with redoubled vigor and proceeded so far as to use some certain figures of speech which are thought not quite consistent with female delicacy  a wide breach ensued between the disputants in consequence of this disagreement which was in a few days happily healed by the mediation of some friends and the ladies now visit as usual but have obliged themselves in the most solemn manner for their mutual quiet never to mention for the future the names of garrick and barry in the company of each other  i have only related this affair as a slight instance of the unhappy effects attending our partydivisions that they are productive of the greatest uneasiness in the conjugal state is so very notorious

acquaintance of mine who is strongly in the garrickean interest paid his addresses to a very agreeable and everywayaccomplishd young lady but a violent barryist the young couple liked one another perfectly well and there appeared no reasonable objection to the match but the difference of principles  this however was an obstacle not easily to be got over the relations on both sides had several meetings and many difficulties arose in settling this point which was at last adjusted by a compromise the lawyer who was employed to draw the articles received directions to insert a clause importing that all the boys born of that marriage should be bred up garrickeans and the girls barryists  the reader i believe is surprised that i have not in this dissertation upon parties taken any notice of the quinists a faction which in its time has been by no means contemptible whether we consider the bulk or quality of the leaders the reason is  i have observed that this party is considerably declined since the abdication of their monarch most of them having subscribed to the revolution which took place in goodmans fields in the year fortytwo and those few who still continue attached to this cause being old men from whom no disturbance can be expected in the female world  that these heartburnings threaten danger to the state i think is very obvious the business of the theaters is almost finished and it is expected that both houses will be prorogued in a few days when many of the members will go into the country and most unquestionably excite a partyspirit wherever they fix we shall hear from one town that the inhabitants are divided into marrists and scrasists from another that the usherists have got the upper hand and the favorers of raftor do not dare to show their faces what influence these divisions may have upon the approaching election i leave to the gentlemen in power to consider not doubting but they will thank me for this friendly intimation and make a proper use of it  from this fair and candid representation of the present state of parties among us many useful reflections may be drawn which as they are extremely obvious the readers good sense will undoubtedly suggest to him i might here dismiss my subject in the words of horace verbum non amplius addam  but i am unwilling to conclude without declaring my own principles i have the satisfaction to say that i am conscious of being entirely free of partyprejudice  i am neither a garrickean nor a barryist but between both in an honest mean  i defy my greatest enemies to prove that i ever gave a clap or hiss but according to the dictates of my conscience  and o my dear countrymen and countrywomen there is nothing i so ardently desire as an union of all true friends to our theatrical entertainments in order to rouse the directors of the drury lane and covent garden companies from their lethargy and make them sensible that though the public have a violent appetite for plays and can feed on a romeo and juliet thirty or forty times in a season yet they would be glad of a little variety  this surely they may modestly expect as the heavy subsidies for the maintenance of these states are raised entirely upon them if we should be happy enough to obtain this next winter i flatter myself all discord will subside we shall admire the powers of a garrick and do justice to his inimitable performances in a lear a richard a macbeth an hamlet a ranger or a bendick without being any way disinclined to yield to the tender emotions of a castalio or backward to acknowledge the dignity and homefelt anguish of an othello in short we shall then enter the theater without any other biass on our minds than a disposition to be pleased  true intelligence bedford coffeehouse may    yesterday evening between the hours of seven and eight mr town came to the board of criticism in his usual clothes and gave his assent to the following bills viz  an act for preventing clandestine amors behind the scenes  an act for the better suppressing the growth of poetry and for other purposes therein mentioned  an act for limiting the number of orangewenches in both playhouses and to several public and private bills  after which mr town made the following most gracious speech  my friends and critics it has always been a very sensible pleasure to me to see you assembled together and i shall continue the exertion of my best abilities for your welfare the management of the theaters has ever been my principal care and i have now the satisfaction to inform you that mr richs negotiations with the harlequin of the italian comedy in paris for which purpose he is gone thither have been attended with the greatest success and there is no reason to apprehend any danger from the machinations of david garrick esquire who is in a constant alliance with men of genius and is perpetually encouraging them to write for the stage in hopes that at length the true spirit of dramatic poesy may again

manifested to me and my judgment  my friends and critics  the summer season being now opened i am unwilling to detain you any longer from your country seats at islington hoxton marybone etc you may rest assured there is nothing i so ardently wish as to see you all the most cavilling critics in europe in the several places of your residence do your endeavors to promote the the true genuine spirit

is accordingly prorogued  numb    graysinn saturday may         contemptu famae contemni virtutes tacitus the sentiment which is very beautifully expressed in the words of my motto grew naturally out of the conversation at the last meeting of our club and to enforce it still further mr gulliver who then occupied the chair produced a stricture of oriental history which he believed would impress the reflection deeper on the mind as it carried with it the admonitions of experience and therefore as such i shall recommend it to the perusal of my readers  in the chronicles of the sultans of the east it is recorded that when othman held the rank of vizier under a prince of the sassanian race and by his faithful councils added security luster and dignity to the throne his son mustapha displayed in his early bloom all the virtues which could endear him to the best of fathers and render him amiable in the eyes of all beholders achmet the hermit who had been called forth from his retreat in order to attend the cultivation of his tender mind had taken care to season him with religion and to inflame his young imagination with the desire of a fair and honest fame the sage well knew that this propensity would be a strong secondary aid to the native beauty of virtue would warm and cherish his native goodness and invigorate the exertion of it accordingly mustapha soon drew the eyes of all men upon him his conduct was a constant emanation of benevolence and in his bosom glowed that intense heroic ardour which soon after distinguished him in the field of glorious danger in a short time he arrived to the highest degree of popularity the sultan heaped favors on him in what might be called a profusion of liberality had not his merit daily deserved it from him he was delegated with unlimited authority to command the armies of the sultan and from the confines of persia to the indian ocean he soon reduced every thing under subjection though he was yet green in years each tongue was mute in his presence and before him every eye looked down with a kind of reverential awe he loved the prince who raised him to this state of elevation and by the gentleness of his manners he softened that envy which might otherwise arise against the luster of his glory  while mustapha was constantly reaping fresh laurels and gratifying his insatiable love of fame by daily acquisitions of glory his father at home met with a reverse of fortune othman possessed all those qualities which shone forth in his son with a more striking luster and he vainly imagined that in a corrupt degenerate court he could be great and good with impunity but the storm now gathered heavily in clouds around him and the turbulent tempests of jealousy ambition hatred and revenge environed him with a whirlwind more dreadful than that which tears up whole continents of sand in the deserts of arabia the grand apartments in his house which were formerly filled with a band of courtiers were now empty and forlorn he was divested of all his honors his trust was taken away from him and after a series of years spent in the service of his prince he was stripped of every thing but his paternal estate whither he withdrew to shelter himself from an ungrateful world  in this retirement othman what were your thoughts what were your sensations the sun ushered in a day void of occupation and the night a train of restless dreams at length his constitution received such severe strokes from a constant succession of corrosive cares that he languished under the pressure and his soul sickened to desperation a gloomy visionary light obscured his eyes with dim suffusion and he beheld with joy the approaching sunset of his days as he lay languishing on the bed of sickness he gave orders that his son might be informed of his situation mustapha immediately quitted his high command flew to his dying fathers languid arms and in a gush of tears embraced his agonizing body othman with what little strength he had left raised his head and fixing his faded eye balls on him my son said he hear my words you have beheld your father in the sunshine of prosperity you now behold him in the last extreme of misery i am fallen a prey to the intrigues of illdesigning men  the angel of death now hovers over his victim then listen to my last directions  avoid public honors  fly from courts as from the monsters of the desert be not misled by a vain love of fame and an unavailing popularity  virtue is its own reward  then let your happiness be fixed in your own mind independent of external objects  despise the opinions of mankind which are always fluctuating and uncertain as the caspian when deformed with tempests  for the remainder of your days have a contempt for fame  it will only lead you into a series of toils for an ungrateful world  steal through life imperceptible like the path of the arrow which leaves no trace behind it  let your moderation shade you from envy and look down upon the giddy   he could no more his lot for eternity was cast and he expired mustapha wept in bitterness of anguish over the best of fathers he treasured up his precepts in the inmost recesses of his soul and instantly began to conform his conduct to the practice of them his dignities and honors he resigned forthwith and in the sullenness of his soul he locked himself from the world his house no longer resounded with singers and with minstrels no longer did amber and aloes administer their rich perfumes the vases of agate which in his fathers time overflowed with all the delicious liquors of the east lay tumbled into an unregarded heap and even the hand of charity which was before stretched out at his gate was now congealed and frozen up echo no longer repeated his praises and scandal began to accumulate disgrace upon him this he heard and he despised the rumor the many lessons given him by his tutor were now totally forgot the seeds of virtue lay dormant in his breast and his love of fame was now entirely extinguished nay the very thoughts of it were loathsome to him insomuch that to leave no room for a suspicion that he had any the least regard for popularity remaining he would often say to himself that the world may see how much i am above any notices it may take of me i must not be guilty of a single good action  by imperceptible degrees this turn of mind settled into a fixed insensibility to all dignity of character and on the contempt of fame was grafted a contempt of virtue  mustapha mustapha you thundered at the head of armies whole nations obeyed your voice and now how altered relaxed and enfeebled you groan in anguish reluctant to every finer impulse of the soul and callous to all the stimulating incentives to virtue   true intelligence chapter

wafted abroad by every breeze and at length reached the ears of achmet in his hermitage the venerable old man heard the story with the severest compunction his heart was appalled within him as if the hand of death had smote him he sat down in his haram but there no angel whispered to his meditation no inspiration bore his thoughts aloft to the prime source of being mustaphas shame depressed the swellings of enthusiasm and quite extinguished the pious fervor of his soul he was tormented with the reflection that so noble a youth should stop short in the middle of his career and check such excellent propensities as he knew were lodged in his breast at length he arose and taking his staff in his hand he extinguished the light which burned before him and set out on a journey over the deserts of arabia and in a short time arrived at his pupils habitation  it was with difficulty he gained admission but the gates were no sooner opened for him than he went straight to his young pupils apartment mustapha was reclined upon a sofa his looks sullenly fixed on the ground and his mind hardening into insensibility achmet eagerly presented himself before him his eyes were vivid and piercing though the quickness of their luster was somewhat diminished by the galling effusion of tears which this unexpected shock had cost him the winter of age had shed its snows upon his head and beard and the lively expression of passions which throbbed in mingled tumult about his heart rendered him an alarming object to his pupil a conscious blush diffused itself over his face at sight of the hoary sage and both their sensations being too big for utterance their tongues were suspended and their eyes overflowing discoursed for a while in the most eloquent pathetic silence at length achmet faintly uttered mustapha and a gush of tears choked up the rest mustapha at this was covered with confusion and attempted to break from him but the palsied nerves of the venerable hermit felt a renovation of strength from the glowing purpose of his soul and laying fast hold of his pupil he exclaimed you shall not put me from you in me your genius now alarms you by me it means to rouse you from your lethargy and awaken the dying embers of that amiable fire which formerly kindled all your spirits in those happier days when my instructions were refreshing to your ears as the morning dews to the verdure which clothes the fields of damascus but now how art thou fallen each finer principle of virtue is suppressed and you are even deaf to the voice of fame that sweetest music to a virtuous ear but to redeem thee at once from the dreams of folly and overweening pride in which thy soul is now sluggishly immersed read there that mystic truth which a genie put into my hand in an hour of inspiration when my thoughts were swelled with sublime ideas of the dispensations of him who is in the heaven of heavens and whose wonderworking hand launched forth the planets into the illimitable void and still continues to produce the harmony of the physical and moral world by various secrets and indirect causes  the heart of mustapha was alarmed and he read as follows when virtue was sent down from the third heaven to restrain the irregular passions of mankind the dignity of her mien and beauty of her aspect were sufficiently attractive to make her admired of all beholders but such is the depravity of human nature that these allurements soon began to lose of their influence and virtue shortly finding herself neglected and forlorn returned to her celestial mansion in order to prefer her complaint against the sons of men there she remonstrated that blind mankind was not only insensible to her personal charms but also deaf to the promise of rewards which were to be dispensed to her votaries in a future state of existence though this was a sufficient provocation of wrath yet such was the supreme benevolence that virtue was again sent down upon her mission and the better to strengthen her interests fame was ordered to attend her with an high commission to dispense temporary retributions even on this side of the grave as soon as they reached the verge of human nature fame blew aloft her silver trumpet and an instantaneous glow was kindled in all hearts wherever virtue was cherished fame pursued her footsteps and if court was any where made to her alone she was sure to withold her favors until the candidates found means by the recommendation of virtue to insinuate themselves into her good graces by this amiable union mankind were restrained within just restrictions and were excited to a series of meritorious actions either by an attachment to the allurements of virtue or from a desire of obtaining the applause of fame but short is the duration of all sublunary things fame in her turn began to share the same fate that virtue had met before her the appetites of men were now wellnigh sated and the music of applause no longer sounded grateful to the ear it was observable that wherever she met with a repulse virtue was soon known to follow her and it very rarely happened that she remained with above one or two in an age without her attendant fame in process of time matters were carried to that extremity that this celestial pair were tired of their pilgrimage and wearied out at length they resolved to offer up a joint petition to be recalled they therefore flew to the throne of him who is in the heaven of heavens and humbly urged that it was in vain for them to sojourn any longer upon earth as deluded mankind was now entirely seduced by the spurious ornaments of the monster vice which had issued out of the regions of darkness and set up in opposition to all that virtue and fair fame could inspire in this instance again the tender care of heaven was eminently displayed and these two radiant beings were a second time commanded to return to earth with directions that however depraved the appetites of men might be they should persist in an unremitted course of endeavors for their service but the more effectually to strengthen their cause a fiend called infamy was ordered to issue forth from the unhallowed cell of vice and to adhere close to her whatsoever way she should bend her course it was likewise ordained that whoever should betray a disregard for virtue and honest fame should be branded by infamy and that these two should thus continue to wander among mankind until the angel of death should walk forth by the command of the almighty and sweep the whole race from the face of the earth to receive that retribution of rewards and punishments which may be due to their virtue or vice  mustapha now perceived the mists of error clearing away from before his understanding he embraced achmet and poured out the effusions of his gratitude for thus recalling him to the task of virtue whose strength consists in activity he acknowledged that the transition is easy from a contempt of fame to an equal disregard for the virtues that deserve it and the name of mustapha during the remainder of the chronicles of this reign makes a distinguished figure and it is said that he closed a life of virtue with honor and renown  true intelligence childs coffeehouse st pauls churchyard we are sorry to observe that amongst the occasional visits which mr ranger pays to our fellow laborers in the

contracted a very heavy debt on the score of visiting and being willing to discharge the demands upon me as expeditiously as possible i determined to dedicate an entire evening to the settlement of this account i accordingly writ my name upon about fifteen pieces of card and fallied out upon this important business at most of the places where i called i had no occasion to alight but discharged my obligation by delivering to the footman at the door one of the tokens of modern friendship above mentioned i had however the good fortune of finding some of my friends at home who received me with prodigious affability and after desiring mine and giving me their opinion of the important disputes concerning elizabeth canning and mary squires dismissed me with great politeness  i was not a little fatigued with the successive repetition of the same flimzy chitchat in every company where i was admitted and quite disgusted with so trifling a manner of spending my time i was just going to direct the coachman to drive home when i recollected that i had not seen my friend mr discount of cateatonstreet since the lord mayors day  this determined me to steer my course toward the city and my good genius prevailed so far that i found mr discount his lady and two daughters at home it being the day upon which mrs discount saw company  as soon as i entered the room my old acquaintance saluted me in a friendly manner and assured me that he was glad to see me his lady in an ironical compliment delivered with a forced smile gave me to understand that she was highly sensible of the honor i did her family in condescending to come into the city and the young ladies curtesied and told me with some appearance of resentment that they were extremely glad to find that mr ranger had not entirely forgot his old friends  this reception somewhat disconcerted me however i endeavored to acquit myself with the usual compliments such as  that i had the greatest esteem for mr discount s family  that nobody respected them more  but that affairs of business had engrossed my time  that i seldom could command an hour to myself  but that i certainly should not be so had a visiter for the futurs  as soon as this preliminary point was settled mr discount seated me next himself and turning about asked me how things went at our end of the town  what says he shall we have a lottery do you think i was going to answer that i really was not in the secret of those schemes when the eldest miss discount interposed and said lord papa do you imagine that mr ranger troubles himself about the things you talk of in your city coffeehouses what are your moneyaffairs to him  have you been at a great many plays last winter mr ranger  what do you think of footes farce i saw it the first night  i would not miss it the first night for any thing   as i was meditating an answer my worthy friend takes me by the hand and exclaims  heavens mr ranger what will this world come to the young people of this age sir think of nothing but diversions  from morning to night my ears mr ranger are dinned with garrick and barry and dogs and monkeys and mother midnight and spoonatissimo and such a jargon that one would imagine the order of things was inverted  here the youngest miss discount seized the conversation  nay now papa says she because you do not go to those places yourself you would not have any body else go  that is true betty replied mamma he is a strange man to be sure  mr discount has no notion of any thing genteel  well he must have his own way   mr discount without taking notice of these interraptions resumed his discourse  why sir says he this must portend something  certainly a judgment hangs over the nation  we shall undoubtedly have another earthquake at least  you know the last earthquake was occasioned by the immense number of places of public entertainment  the bishop said so in his letter  do you not remember it mr ranger  here a loud laugh made it unnecessary for me to reply and my wellmeaning friend intent upon his subject continued to animadvert on the extravagance of the times  your uncle caleb added he mr ranger and i used frequently to talk over these things together and we have often lamented the degeneracy of the times  we foresaw that it must end in the ruin of the nation  ay we foresaw it a long time ago  all this luxury which has been the bane of old england has crept in among us since the year twenty  ah that year twenty mr ranger was a fatal year  a fatal year indeed  here miss discount could contain no longer but broke out with some warmth  lord papa you are always bringing up that year twenty  how many hundred years ago is it since that year twenty  it does not signify talking  while people are in the world they must do as other people do or they had better be out of the world and one must go to public places or they will have nothing to talk of  is it not so mr ranger come now i am sure you are of my opinion ant you  as i was unwilling to disoblige either party in this dispute i replied to the lady in two lines of prior seldom your opinions err your eyes are always in the right this topic had i thought been pursued rather too far therefore i waved the conversation and asked the ladies whether they had seen mrs brillant since her marriage to this they all answered at once o yes  whereupon i took the liberty to address myself particularly to mrs discount and desired to know whether she did not think her a very fine woman  a fine woman mr ranger replied she how can you ask me such a question to be sure she is a showy woman and such a one as takes with the men but you cannot call her a fine woman surely  then she wears her cap so horridly and always overdresses herself  the gentlemen i know admire her but i protest i cannot see for what  madam replied i i must beg leave to be of a different opinion in my eyes mrs brillant appears a very amiable woman and it gives me a great deal of pleasure that she is so happily married  o indeed says miss discount i believe she is very happy for she has a very handsome equipage and a sweet pair of earrings and then she sees a vast deal of company  there were ninety persons at her last rout  she plays crownwhist   i could not forbear observing that i was a little surprised so discerning a young lady should estimate mrs brillants happiness from the stake she played for at whist when to me it appeared that she possessed a a more certain source of felicity in the amiable qualities and polite accomplishments of her husband  o law that is true replied the ladies they say her husband too is a pretty man  we were proceeding farther on this head when a thundering rap was given at the door and the servant signified that lady portsoken was coming into the room as i thought i had paid a visit of a sufficient length i took advantage of the alarm given by this city knights lady and withdrew unnoticed  in my return home i could not avoid reflecting on the capricious notions the female world entertain of happiness  to be dressed as well as others of the same rank to be present at all public places without considering the entertainment in any other light than as the means of bringing company together to visit and be visited by every one whom they think it of consequence to salute at the playhouse to live if it may be called living in a perpetual course of cardplaying and to sum up the whole to be married to a man of any age figure or qualities whatsoever capable and willing to support all this in the opinion of ninetynine females in a hundred constitutes a happy woman i should be perhaps censured as a pedant if i offended the delicacy of my female readers with observing that they degrade the faculties of the human soul by confining the exercise of them within such a circle of trifles but i hope i may be allowed leave to refer them to the spectator where they will learn from the elegant mr addison that the strongest argument which can be advanced for the immortality of the soul is the continual progress of the mind in the acquisition of knowledge  now i would submit it to the candor of my fair countrywomen whether their conduct does not subvert the principles upon which this polite philosopher reasons and tend to establish the mohammedan doctrine that the souls of women are mortal  should this turkish tenet ever prevail among us dreadful will be the consequences how will it be possible for an english lady to content herself with the fourth part of a husband and what a melancholy transition will it be from the liberties at present indalged to british wives to the confinement and horrors of a seraglio   i could add much more on this subject but i am aware that my pretty readers are prepared with a conclusive answer to whatever can be advanced  well you may say what you will but people will do as they like for all that  the force of which i readily acknowledge and as becomes me lay by the pen  true

third of the company received their rudiments under her auspices  numb    graysinn saturday june         vultis and his mecum pariter considere regnis urbem quam statuo vestra est  virg i have of late received several very urgent letters from my correspondents in which they strenuously press me into the service of my country and though i have always disclaimed politics as a subject averse from my inclinations these gentlemen are for making a statesman of me in my own despite i must own i am not willing to be thrown off my bias but when the act of parliament in favor of the jews engrosses so much of our conversation and has worked all our spirits into a ferment it then becomes the duty of a public writer to make his bow to the muses and devote one lucubration to the happiness and welfare of his countrymen  the english have naturally interwoven in their constitution a peculiar kind of national selflove and the least attempt to dispense a favor to foreigners alarms their fears and awakens that jealousy which is natural to their very frame it is to this we owe the general discontent which has broke out among all ranks of people upon the late occasion but that it is owing to a mistaken prejudice i believe will be manifest to any man that does not see things with the jaundiced fie of party  it has been said that by this act we give the lie to the scripture and fly in the face of a peremptory prophecy which declares that the jews should be without a fixed scttlement in any country a vagabond race upon the face of the earth there was a time when this objection might be allowed to carry with it some degree of weight while christianity subsisted in this kingdom it would have been the grossest absurdity to introduce a bill of this nature  but the christian dispensation has entirely disappeared from among us and i believe in the memory of the oldest person now living no trace of it can be found which is in my opinion a conclusive argument in favor of this naturalization act were it any way inconsistent with the religion now in fashion i persuade myself it would have met with opposition from a certain bench in the h  of l  but as nothing of this kind was offered it is to be presumed that judaism properly coincides with our present disposition both in church and state and i would therefore recommend this doctrine to be preached from the pulpit for the better quieting the minds of men and if the right reverends would issue out pastoral letters to this purpose the remedy would be quicker in its operation and the mistaken notions which the common people have imbibed would the sooner be effaced  about three weeks since i had occasion to take a boat at whitehall stairs in order to go a little way down the river we no sooner put off from shore than i perceived the waterman to be a very sensible fellow and particularly knowing in politics i therefore gave him an opportunity of discovering his sentiments on the bill in question and he discussed it with great strength of lungs and vehemence of observation d  mn the circumcised dogs says he now they are naturalized i will engage we shall have them all turn watermen and they will have all the business of the river to themselves  this story which is really a matter of fact will show what prejudices are entertained by the common people who have raised the violent clamor against the israelites on this occasion and hence may be inferred that wisdom does not always cry out in the streets for my part i am persuaded when things are considered dispassionately the act will bear a different aspect in the eyes of all men of sense for who have been served by it not the poor jews who are still lest under the severity denounced against them but the rich who are by this stroke rescued from heavens vengeance and this regard to the affluent and contempt for the moneyless i take to be perfectly consistent with the genius of a trading nation and i am of opinion that from this incident a very useful moral may be enforced viz that money cannot only influence sublunary things but also supersede the decrees of providence and as i think this act has given the nation in general a very great accession of credit reputation honor and riches i should be glad to see a further step taken in order to render the work complete i have not had time to digest my thoughts into a regular scheme and shall therefore content myself to suggest a few hints which may be improved at maturity  first as it is apparent from what has been observed already that the christian religion has no longer a footing in this country it may not be improper to repeal the sacramental test and to substitute in its room the act of circumcision for which purpose proper circumcisers may be found in dukesplace who shall perform the operation upon all our placemen and a proper number may be chosen out of a certain venerable body in the nature of a jury of matrons to examine whether the person be qualified according to law  secondly as the jews are known to be possessed of overgrown riches and as no lottery can be vigorously carried on without their concurrence whenever sir john barnard or any

conversation that mr suchaone is a man of very good sense or on the reverse that he has not common sense and yet notwithstanding the frequent usage of this phrase i will e upon me to say there is not a term in the english language so little understood or made use of in so many vaguesignifications the cause of this variety of conception is to be imputed to the various lot of human life in which most people derive their stock of ideas from the occupation they have been accidentally thrown into from whence they acquire such confined habits of thinking that they have no power of reflection out of the beaten path and most things are by them determined according to their partial survey of men and manners  i have somewhere read of a people residing in a small town situate in the midst of the alps with whom the principal constituent of beauty is a swelling prominence of flesh in the throat by them called a gother and it is recorded that when when an english gentleman remarkable for all the graces of manly beauty was passing by on his travels to italy these virtuosos observed that he was of an elegant form and would really be very handsome if had but a gother in like manner we daily meet with as notable opinions relating to the intellects of our neighbors i remember myself to have heard a person of excellent parts condemned for a blockhead because he never won an odd trick at whist

rule by which to judge of a character as i conceive it the term sense is derived from the organs of bodily sensation which when in due order give to the mind an immediate information of the qualities inherent in natural bodies from thence the phrase is transsferred to the human mind and denotes a quick power of perception in the understanding upon all occurrences in life were i to define a man of sense i should call him a person of clear apprehension and sound judgment talents which a small degree of observation will convince us many are possessed of though they do not upon all occasions avail themselves of them but on the contrary let them lie dormant in their minds without calling them forth into action the late sir richard steel i believe may be allowed to have enjoyed as strong

dirt which though a necessary of life is certainly incapable of conferring one single accomplishment either to the head or heart and is generally the acquisition of the dullest of human race  certain it is that to create a fortune in the ordinary paths of business is so far from requiring wit genius learning imagination invention or any liberal faculty that every one of those attributes have rather a tendency to keep the possessor of them still the poorer as heavens blessed beams turns vinegar more sour an eager love of pelf a narrow attention to what is called the main chance a spice of that clergymans way of thinking who delivered in his sermon that a shilling is a serious thing and a cold languid unimpassioned temper are the principal ingredients in the composition of the man of business while persons of quick understanding will always have lively sensations which must at times hurry them into scenes of action astonishing to the sober shopkeeper or the sedate bookkeeper but it should be remembered that passions are the gales of life and that to be divested of them is so far from denoting a sensible mind that it is a proof of lamentable dullness and stupidity i shall

would take a sober walk to islington newington paddington etc and when a frolic seized him he would in the fullness of his soul spend his threepence at jennys whim as he grew up he became a downright stoic in the government of his passions to such a degree that he was thought at length totally to have extinguished them all except his darling love of money which has never ceased to influence his thoughts in short avarus has been so attentive to the main chance that he is now flourishing and starving with a large fortune is determined to sell his vote at the next election and is likely in time

him a great knowledge of greek and latin while at oxford he enlarged his mind with useful studies and cultivated a just and elegant taste for all polite literature being turned of one and twenty he entered himself in the temple where he read the law with sufficient application but in order to unbend his mind he was frequently found dipping into shakespeare and it has been said by his enemies that he never would entirely divest himself of an attachment to the belles lettres i have somewhere seen it remarked that a taste in reading is apt to infuse the same in morals which observation proved fatally true to liberalis and in consequence of this turn of mind he could never prevail on himself to fall into any mean practices by which conduct he soon found himself deserted by his clients and neglected by the attorneys and he now remains unsought in his chambers in the high road to poverty in which agreeably to the way of the world we will leave him to himself and lay down the

wildair in a circle of his acquaintance he was talking over the several occurrences he had met with in his rambles after intelligence that day and as he has a peculiar dexterity in dressing up a story in all its most striking colors without falling into a tedious minute detail of trivial circumstances he touched upon many incidents in a manner so diverting that he excited a general mirth in the little audience that was gathered round him wildair to speak the truth has something extremely captivating in his conversation and is of all the men i know the best turned for society though a fellow of parts he has never suffered his spirits to subside into a serious habit of thinking but in a superficial way glides over every thing that offers in company no subject comes amiss to him and be it what it will he has always something to say for himself which circumstance joined to a sprightly delivery contributes greatly to enliven his company he frequently rallies a gentleman of our intimate acquaintance on this head and will tell him frankly i know jack you are a sensible fellow in the main but as you manage matters your friends must study hard to find it out  take my word for it the world is very superficial and a facility of dismissing every subject in a brisk manner will make a person pass for a knowing one at the same time that it renders him sociable and of course agreeable  this is my worthy friend wildairs way of thinking and upon this plan he acquits himself so well that he is extremely sought by his acquaintance and whenever they lay hold of him it is difficult for him to elude their solicitations for a party of pleasure this was the case with him the other night and as i was paying my debt at the bar he made up to me and with a whisper told me that if i would make one of the company it would furnish me with hints for some future essay in vain i reminded him that it was club night and his turn to possess the chair this party he assured me would afford higher entertainment i yielded to his solicitations and i must say that my manner of spending the evening has supplied me with materials the like of which never came in my way before  before i proceed farther into the business it may not be improper in imitation of the writers for the stage to give a degree of insight into the characters of the dramatis personae the reader is already acquainted with my disposition and way of thinking and he also knows mr wildair the rest of the company consisted of a man of wit a man of humor a damned honest fellow and a person of a very elegant appearance a cool sedate temper and extremely decent and polite in his deportment with this set i shifted the scene from the bedford to the shakespeares head and upon entering the tavern the honest fellow alarmed the house by calling for a room with great vociferation which being showed to us with the utmost attention he ordered a brace of bottles of the right sort immediately filled a round of bumpers and roared out come let us be jolly ranger  d  mn your musty books  let us sit down  this i had no objection to but as i was attempting to do it the man of humor with infinite pleasantry removed the chair that was placed for me the consequence of which was that to the great surprise of the whole company i was brought to the ground as i received a contusion in the fall i could not entirely relish the joke but it gave infinite satisfaction to almost all the rest and they agreed that it really was a very good thing as good a thing as ever they had known immense by g  d says the honest fellow a glorious hum says the wit while my humorous friend with a dry composure of countenance denoting something between jest and earnest begged my pardon and then officiously offered to settle my wig and this he did in such a facetious position and such a whimsical stare of the curls that thence was deducible a new flow of mirth which amidst the bursts of joy that stunned my ears he enjoyed in a sober manner humor being ever grave and sedate wildair perceiving by this time that i did not approve my company came over to me and begged i would see it out and squeezing my hand he added from virgil forsan and haec olim meminisse juvabit  this had so much prevalence with me that i agreed and the honest fellow showed away egregiously the bottle went round at so brisk a rate that my eyes began to dance in my head like wildfire by all that is burgundy says he harris is the best pimp in england  here waiter call harris enter harris  harris d  mn your old soul get us a fine girl  there is a fine

and blood please your honor  most of the irish wenches have please your honor  and if your honor chooses it i fancy i have a bait will bring her out  this proposal was universally received and in a short time the lady was ushered into the room not without some glances mutually interchanged between her and harris  the man of humor and the wit immediately began to play her off as they called it  but as it is a rule among good writers never to enlarge too much upon any subject and to leave something for the imagination of the reader to supply i shall upon this occasion conform to the precept and will only add that the lady in the space of about half an hour drank and sung and laughed and cried and danced and sat and talked and said nothing with the most surprising quickness in the vicissitude till at length the honest fellow swore that she spoiled good fellowship andabruptly desired her to take half a guinea at the bar and withdraw which madam performed after several te hes and titters  this matter being settled we were suddenly surprised with the most enlivening melody accompanied by a sprightly voice that plainly and musically articulated non toujours dire non etc it seems one of those fair natives of savoy who are goodnatured enough to undergo the fatigue of a long journey in order to make our public streets harmonious was placed in the yard with private instructions to entertain us with the vocal and instrumental strain by this our spirits received a fresh reinforcement and the man of wit immediately threw his wig out of the window bounced over the table broke several bottles and glasses and alarmed me with a most intolerable rap on the shoulders the man of humor expressed his approbation with a dry joke the honest fellow pushed the burgundy about and the decent gentleman whom the reader will recollect i mentioned in the beginning of this paper smiled with the most winning complacence this personage has hitherto made no figure in this symposium the fact is he did not drink above six glasses of wine during the whole night but now his heart seemed to dilate his eyes sparkled with the most vivid luster and in the cheerfulness of his soul he held out his fist to the company and come says he odd or even for this little silver the spirits of almost every one present were ready to flow into any channel and gaming became the general amusement cards were immediately rung for to play at brag and after a few rounds the elegant polite man produced a box and dice out of his pocket and i believe he will hardly forgive me for desiring a bill at five in the morning as he was in a tolerable run and had picked up about seventy pounds however with some reluctance he condescended to collect the reckoning which as soon as every body paid his proportion he carefully put into his pocket and desired his friend tomkyns to place the whole to his account  this being adjusted in order to complete this evening the man of humor proposed a scheme which he said would afford more pleasantry than he had ever known itis says he the luckiest thought in the world  a better  ne  never  enter  ed  into a  mans  he  ad  let us tofs up who shall  be  th

wildair who was instantly surrounded and the honest fellow opened the window not without violent roaring while the decent man still continued at the table throwing the dice and saying to himself sevens the main i really believe the coroners inquest would have sat on wildairs body at ten oclock in the morning had not the timely interposition of sober entreaty begged him off  upon this i made my escape and i do not know when i spent an evening in a manner that has given me such reflections the man of wit i suppose has acquired his notions of things from sir richard blackmore who tells us that wit consists in regular and exalted ferments or from mr dennis who defines it a motion of furious joy and pride of soul upon conception of an hint for indeed this gentleman has certainly very exalted ferments and most surprising motions upon the conception of his hints i shall take occasion in some ensuing essay to undeceive him by giving the ideas i have formed to myself of the talent he professes and in my next lucubration i shall endeavor to convince the man of humor that he is wide of the character he would be thought to possess as humor is a subject of some difficulty i shall endeavor to treat it with perspicuity and i beforehand beg some mercy of the critics  true intelligence parnassus june    this day arrived a mail from robert dodsley at tullys head in pallmall which

with pleasure upon each others merit in the literary world  numb    graysinn saturday july         populumque falsis dedocet uti vocibus  hor it has been long since recommended to the tribe of critics to adjust and settle their ideas in a clear and regular order by fixing the distinct meaning annexed to each term they make use of in conveying their remarks if this advice was properly adhered to it would cut matters very short in all debates which arise upon points of literature and would enable those who aspire to the province of criticism to pass their judgment with precision but the reverse of this is frequently the case and i shall at present single out two expressions from a multitude of others which appear to me to be used in a vague random manner the determinate meaning of either not being sufficiently ascertained  the terms i mean are an humourist and a man of humor they are thought by what i find synonymous by many people which must be the source of numberless mistakes to define each may be perhaps matter of some difficulty but if i understand them right the reader is welcome to what light i can give him into the matter  an humourist i take to be one under the influence of some remarkable oddity or unaccountable whim which has taken such strong possession of the mind and has so insinuated itself into all its operations that it mixes with the common train of his ideas and thereby gives such a cast to his way of thinking that every thing strikes him in a different light from the rest of his fellow creatures and of consequence every thing he does is also in an extravagant manner  i have not been able to investigate in any historian the first appearance of this species of men in this kingdom whether it was in the nature of the aborigines or first inhabitants of this island or whether it made its inroad among us with that general conflux of different nations which landed here is a point not very easy to determine one thing is clear that they are of a long standing among us and indeed they thrive with such large increase in this our soil that there is room to apprehend the whole nation will shortly become a nation of odd fellows  besides the many extravagancies which this set of men are addicted to they have all a strange notion that they must have their own way mr congreve has observed that there is a proverb by which they are in a great measure governed he that will have a may pole shall have a may pole they are entirely attached to the gratification of their own particular bent their imaginations have contracted such whimsical habits that they see things through a medium to which men of a more reasonable turn are strangers and thence it results that wild and fantastic opinions are delivered upon all topics and their conduct is nothing but a series of inconsistencies  the person who falls into this way of thinking is properly speaking an humourist and quidquid vult valde vult should be the motto of every one of them they being all inflexible in pursuit of their inclinations it is a trite remark that the spirit of liberty and independency which is diffused throughout this kingdom contrioutes very much to feed this odd turn and to promote its growth i have mixed frequently in the meetings of humourists in order to animadvert upon their ways and have always observed that none of them will suffer themselves to be controuled for this exceilent reason because d  mn my blood i can club my reckoning as well as any man and i have been an housekeeper man and boy these thirty or forty years and i pay my rent and so a fig for king g   thus while the humourist has his property secured to him by the salutary laws of our noble constitution he will enjoy his independency to give a proof of which he thinks it essential to have a value for no man and to please himself though at the expense of his company is his darling delight  it is to the observation of these oddities that we owe the man of humor and hence is deducible a definition or rather description of his character he is one who eyes natures walks as mr pope sinely phrases it and catches the manners living as they rise he sees the pololes which have taken root in the man and the many motly circumstances which adhere to him he looks as it were into his very mind perceives there the jaundice through which every thing paes and from whence all objects derive their hue he sees the imagination tinged with this strange dye and all the affections of the soul discolored by it he views such traces formed in his brain that it is rendered quite different from that of any other human creature and thus the man of humor perceives the secret and internal springs of action which lead on the humourist he cannot help smiling to see the operations of his soul so extravagant and being acquainted with the latent cause of those odd appearances which disclose themselves upon all occasions he afterward represents them to the world in true and lively colors  thus may the two characters in question be described though they have been so much mistaken by many people the confusion i apprehend is owing to the vague use of the word humor which is promiscuously applied to both it is common to say of the humourist he has his humor or it is his humor and of the humourous man we assert that he has a great fund of humor in both cases the phrase carries with ta different sense denoting in the former instance the foible or whim which operates upon the mans conduct and in the latter signifying that pleasantry which represents the odd fellow in a diverting light the poverty of our language has introduced this ambiguous use of the word but if people would be carefur to acquire perspicuity in their ideas and the terms they express them by it would prevent much perplexity and confusion  for instance it would be absurd in any critic to call the inimitable mr fielding an humourist but he who would pronounce him to be a man of exquisite humor would i believe express something more pertinent to the point in like manner mr hogarth has exhibited in his pieces with the most masterly strokes of his pencil an whole set of humourists and the ingenious artist who thus enchant our eye is undoubtedly a man of humor  there is another cause to which in my opinion this mistake has been greatly owing it frequently happens that a man of humor is at the same time in some measure an humourist himself these two characters thus blended together have often a very happy effect and serve to heighten each other this we experience in shaiespears falstaff in whom we find united in a pleasing assemblage the mixed qualities of these two different characters sir johns love of plunder his pretensions to deeds of hardiness his aversion to cowards and his moralizing on the manners of the age cannot but appear whimsical when we consider that he is sitter to drink sack and unbutton him after dinner than to attempt feats of prowess that he is an accomplished coward in his heart and that his way of life is quite abandoned and dissolute these are the circumstances which denote him an odd fellow but his quick perception of the foibles of his neighbors and his vivacity in exhibiting them in a ridiculous point of view are the qualities which constitute him a man of humor this last circumstance i apprehend makes sir john a favorite with every body and endears him to all the sons of merriment and in this if i mistake not lies the chief difference between shakespeare and ben johason the characters produced by the latter are always disagreeably odd their whims are so extravagant that they sometimes deserve rather the name of madmen and there is hardly any thing in any of them that would induce a gentleman to spend an evening with them  it requires a close knowledge of the world to exhibit personages of this cast on the stage every idea that rises in the mind of an odd fellow his various ways of thinking and inconsistencies must be the constant object of the poets attention and he must be careful to give to each his specific language the player must not only be acquainted with the human heart and human understanding but he has also a farther step to take he must watch the humourist in every circumstance his manner of delivery his tone of voice the cast of his eye his every gesture and attitude must fall immediately under his inspection and to all this he must add the rare talent of concealing his art  in this point i am apt to think mr woodward excellent as he is from an overwarmth of spirit sometimes deficient i would submit it to himself whether his feeling of the whimsies of some characters is not now and then too lively and whether his sensations do not carry him so far in some passages as to make it visible that he is conscious of the oddity of the appearance even while he is personating the man  his bobadil is one of the exceptions to this remark and his not permitting his fancy to run into riots in that part has so sine an effect that i am persuaded were healways equally upon his guard his greatest enemy would have nothing to do but to admire him  whoever has seen mrs pritchard in beatrice in maria in clarinda etc will recollect such lively and acknowledged touches of nature as can hardly be equalled unless the pleasantry of mrs clive in her very humourous walk of comedy may be deemed to rival them  i cannot conclude without mention of mr garrick who is certainly admirable in every species of acting in tragedy his power over the passions is too well known to be here insisted on and in comedy every thing is impressed by him on his audience with the nicest skill and in such parts as benedict and sir john brute he is at once an humourist and a man of humor with the most diverting pleasantry i shall dismiss this paper after applying the words of mr pope on this occasion he is not more a master of the great than of the ridiculous in human nature of our noblest tendernesses than of our vainest foibles of our strongest emotions than of our idlest sensations  true intelligence richards coffeehouse temple bar july   among the accounts which mr ranger gave of

saturday july         o matre pulchra filia pulchrior hor to charles ranger esquire sir if i remember right you some time since recommended the maxim of an old greek philosopher who lays it down as a rule that we should not suffer any thing in life to take too strong an hold of our imagination because that power of the mind is found to have a very considerable influence upon all our sentiments and all our actions certainly when the reins are thrown loose upon the neck of ungoverned fancy we become instantly addicted to what is called in the common phrase castlebuilding than which there is not a more dangerous exercise of our intellectual faculties it is a continual roving of our thoughts to ideal scenes of joy pleasure is our pursuit and when it does not appear within our reach we catch at the shadow instead of the substance we ramble into a kind of fools paradise and lounge away our hours in the imaginary gardens of a dreaming eficurus from whence it results that the sinews of the understanding become relaxed an enervating stillness spreads over all the powers of the soul which is constantly dissolved in luxury of its own creation fond selflove holds up to us a pleasing picture throws some joys into perspective flings what is disagreeable into shades and totally hides from us the thorny parts of the landscape these perhaps may be accounted pleasures but they are in the main like the visionary ideas excited by taking laudanum at the same time that they administer a flow of spirits they invade our nerves and render us entirely unfit for any sphere of action  an instance of this intoxicating power of castlebuilding i have observed for some time past in mrs vainlove who has spent the greatest part of her life in a waking dream and can hardly be accounted one of this world as she has been in the general quite abstracted from society and has dwelt mostly in the airy regions of fancy mrs vainlove in the greener part of her life was flattered into a notion of her own beauty by which means she became fond of power her eyes she thought gave her a right divine to be a pretty tyrant over the opposite sex and as the imagination never deals out blessings with a scanty hand her sway soon became in appearance as extensive as her most delusive hopes could desire but though she led the whole race of man in captivity she at length condescended to let an ambitious lover aspire to her bed the consequence of this condescension was that in due course of time she was the happy mother of a fair daughter in whom she saw her own features but molded with greater delicacy selflove inclined her to admire this flattering likeness of herself and the emanations of fancy bestowed upon her every grace before miss could walk in the mothers eye she danced with all the elegance of auretti and as soon as her tongue began to utter imperfect words lord what a deal of wit the child has dear cousin ant you astonished at her pon honor i never taught her that in process of time miss vainlove devoured up these expressions of admiration with a greedy ear and she began insensibly to believe every word perfectly true till at length her imagination took the very same turn which had distorted the thoughts of her mother before and a series of years instead of banishing the deceit but served to give a stronger tincture to her fancy  when virgils dido is crossed in love and she finds herself upon the point of being deserted by the trojan prince her ready fancy seizes the occasion to disturb her with visionary scenes of solitude in which she thinks herself abandoned and forlorn   semperque relinqui sola sibi semper longam incomitata videtur ire viam  but with miss vainlove the cafe is quite reversed though it should happen that her fate removes her from the dear society of man though the sudden excrescence of a pimple on her face or neck should doom her a recluse until her skin regains its native alabaster smoothness though an untractable lock should refuse to join in amicable confederacy with the rest of her headdress and determine her in a fit of peevishness to sequester herself from the world yet still she reigns queen of the assembly and has a circle of beaux about her the ideal footmans rap sounds transport to her ear and she is every instant receiving the homage of contending lovers who have no existence but in her own brain her mother confirms her in the deception and through the force of habit they are constantly amused with pictures of their own creation like those who mr lock tells us in his treatise on the conduct of the understanding through some distemperature in their blood or any other internal cause see a variety of colors passing continually before them and frequently perceive a groupe of human figures soldiers and combatants marching in procession before the deluded eye of distempered fancy  miss vainlove has carried matters to such an extreme that she really thinks herself the most celebrated toast about town at present ryan at the kings arms is under infinite obligations to her for the plentiful libations of burgundy which have been poured out to her beauty at his house and almost all the taverns in the cities of london and westminster have felt in this way the happy influence of her beauty  her footman has the best place in england because as she has taken it into her head he is in the constant receipt of bribes at all public places to induce him to tell the name of his young mistress and the place of her abode madam la place owes a great deal of her success in business to miss vainloves having the lead of all the fashions and directing the ladies of her acquaintance to her milliner that they may set themselves off with the same advantages of ornament  miss vainlove without having one real lover has constantly a large number of fancied slaves to her frowns and smiles and from thence it happens that she looks upon all the women as a set of creatures that envy her and the men she considers as her votaries fit for nothing but to grace her triumph there is nothing more common with her than to be within a few days of being married to a man of large fortune even when she never exchanged a word with him well to be sure says she it is surprising how things are whispered about the common report is that i am to be married to mr whatdo yecallhim without doubt it is in my power  but  lord the whole town has it it is in vain to assure her that the town does not trouble its head about her her mother has told her she does not meet so fine a woman any where and so the opiate works i met both these egregious characters at vauxhall a few nights since when they informed me that the whole set of foreign ambassadors were now in the young ladies train and that  who is a man of consequence and forture in the country which he represents is absolutely expiring for miss vainlove it happened that after this i paid her several visits and never meeting any of her florid retinue i took the liberty to mention that i never had the pleasure of seeing her gay set of enamoratos to this mrs vainlove replied that she had given them their answer whenever we give them their answer they never come again  thus these two ladies never see any thing in its proper color they think their dreams realities and like mad people are constantly reasoning right from wrong principles pray mr ranger minister to a mind diseased as shakespeare phrases it let them know that they cannot subsist very long upon such airy pleasures as they imagine to themselves and convince them that there is great truth in what is said perhaps too loosely by the comic poet  there is naught but willing waking love that can make blessed the ripened maid or finished man i am sir your constant reader t w g   true intelligence court

verdict  not guilty  numb    graysinn saturday july          nee tu divinam aeneida tenta sed long sequere and vestigia semper adora statius i have lately done myself the pleasure of perusing the several performances in criticism with which voltaire has introduced into the world his various poetical compositions that excellent author has the modesty to call most of these short essays by the name of fugitive pieces of literature but the smallest productions of so pleasing a writer are indelible and will be read with pleasure while there remains any taste for a fine turn of sense and an elegant felicity of expression when i observe thus much i would not have it imagined that i perceive any traces of infallibility about him in the general his remarks are deduced from nature and aristotle and on most occasions he delivers himself with a sound judgment but in my late cursory review of his writings i think i have met with some passages which demand the animadversion of a writer who pretends to instruct or entertain his readers in the discharge of this task i think i cannot acquit myself in a better form than that of a letter to the author this i shall endeavor to do with that politeness which is due to such an extensive genius and i make no doubt but the english reader will concur with me in the few observations which i shall submit to his perusal  to monsieur voltaire sir the republic of letters has happily removed that awkward distance and that extreme difficulty of access which policy ministerial artifice and insolent pride have established in the ordinary intercourse of life by which means it has obtained that the easy seasons of application the mollia tempora fandi are at all times allowed to every member of the serene republic already mentioned and while decency and good manners are preserved an easy habitude subsists between the highest and the lowest of that august body freedom of converse is the happy collision which has struck out so many new lights in every thing relating to the sciences and the liberal arts and it has been observed that there is no book so mean but some useful hint may possibly be derived from it on this account it may be proper to wave all offers at an apology for the liberty an unknown writer allows himself in addressing a letter to so enlightened a genius i shall only premise on this occasion that i take the pen in hand with that respect to which you are certainly entitled by the superiority of your parts but as i have taken exceptions to some criticisms scattered up and down in your writings i cannot suppress a very strong inclination of making some remarks upon them  i have observed sir that you are apt to reprobate the english stage with some degree of acrimony whenever it comes in your way and that you have not hesitated to make free with our immortal shakespeare after a manner which in my opinion is inconsistent with that relish for manly sense which seems to be your characteristic and in a style which to me appears destitute of your usual delicacy if i should say that the boasted bienseance of your country has relinquished you in some of these passages i flatter myself that upon a review of them you will not totally disavow it the most striking of the various judgments which you have vented against the greatest dramatic genius in the world is found in your discourse prefixed to your tragedy of semiramis and is literally translated into english as follows  i do not mean to justify the tragedy of hamlet in every particular it is in fact a barbarous piece abounding with such gross absurdities that it would not be tolerated by the vulgar in france and italy the hero of the play runs mad in the second act and his mistress meets with the same misfortune in the third the prince takes ophelias father for a rat and kills him and in despair she throws herself into a river her grave is dug on the stage and the gravedigger with a skull in his hand amuses himself with a string of miserable jests while the prince answers them in language equally disgusting hamlet his mother and fatherinlaw drink together on the stage they divert themselves with bottlesongs chansons a boire they quarrel they fight and kill one would imagine this play the production of a drunken savage and yet among these absurdities which render the english drama absolutely barbarous there are some strokes in hamlet worthy of the most exalted genius this has always been matter of astonishment to me it looks as if nature in pure sport diverted herself with mixing in shakespeares head every thing sublime and great with all that can be conceived low mean and detestable it is thus the elegant and sensible voltaire speaks of shakespeare i would submit it to yourself sir whether this criticism is candid and whether it is a fair discussion of the tragedy in question we do not concern ourselves in this country with what is agreeable to the taste of the vulgar in france or italy we know that the clinquant of an opera or a comedy ballet is more acceptable to their refinement than the sterling bullion of an english performance but we might expect from a writer of eminence a truer and more exact opinion hamlet sir does not run mad though if he did king lear has proved what a beautiful distress might arise from it he counterfeits madness for his own private end but no body ever imagined that he thinks he is killing a rat when he slays polonius if you will be pleased to recollect the passage you will find that he takes him for his better meaning the king and that the rat is only mentioned to save appearances  that ophelias grave is dug on the stage cannot be refuted but that very indecorum produces so many fine reflections and such an excellent vein of morality as perhaps cannot be paralleled by the scene francoise and is without doubt warmer and more interesting than the frigid unimpassioned declamation of a more correct writer i cannot recollect that hamlet ever shocked me with miserable jests upon this occasion not do i remember that any of them are such honest bottle companions as to carouse and sing merry catches on the stage pray consider sir that our language though no way inferior to the french is not universally understood abroad and from your representation of matters it may be inferred that our great poet is really the drunken savage you have thought proper to call him this would be derogating from the greatest poet the world has ever seen since the days of homer and i believe you will grant is dealing unfairly with a man whom you cannot but reverence  when you confess that he has many flights of the highest elevation you make an approach toward justice but i cannot help thinking that you are somewhat like a painter who lays on just and proper coloring and then instantly effaces it when you and that you are astonished at his sublime excursions of fancy i should have expected from your candor that you would rather have said it is a pity that he who soared to such glorious heights should ever tire his eagle wing and fall beneath himself you may remember that it is with this good temper longinus talks of homer they are dreams says he but they are the dreams of homer he might perhaps with as much propriety as you have given the appellation of a drunken savage have called him an old dotard and asserted that some of his long stories are detestable but a candid critic forgives the imbecilities of human nature and passes sentence like a mild and goodnatured judge  cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti hor in one of your letters concerning the english nation you are greatly pleased with a saying of the late lord bolingbroke in relation to the duke of marlborough he was replied that ingenious nobleman when his opinion was asked so great a man that i have forgot his faults something like this might be your judgment upon shakespeare and it was more particularly incumbent on you to treat his memory with respect because i apprehend you owe very great obligations to him in many of your own dramatic writings we frequently perceive you lighting your torch at his fire in your mahomet macbeth marshals you the way that you are going in many other scenes we can catch your eye fixed upon our immortal bard and in your semiramis you have adventured to introduce a ghost in imitation of the very play which has occasioned the severity already cited the success you met with upon that occasion might serve to convince you of shakespeares inimitable merit the parterre if i mistake not turned their backs to the stage and blew their noses while the ghost on our theater never fails to impress an awful stillness on every mind this sir give me leave to assure you is not owing to the barbarity of our taste but to the amazing power of our poets imagination which could explore the undiscovered regions of eternity and recall the slecting spirit with a solemnity of ideas responsive to the occasion  shakespeare is a kind of established religion in poetry and his bays will always stourish with undiminished verdure when i say this i am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of transgressions but for every transgression he recompenses his auditors with beauties which no art will ever equal that the rules established by aristotle and horace are agreeable to nature i am ready to allow and that inferior geniuses may avail themselves by a skilful conformity to them i as freely assent to but fable is but a secondary beauty the exhibition of character and the excitement of the passions justly claiming the precedence in dramatic poetry it is in writing as in gardening where natures does not afford spontaneous beauties recourse must be had to the embellishments of slow endeavoring art to the regularity of uniform vistas the intricacy of elaborated mazes and a studied insertion of evergreens but when the course of the country of itself presents attractive scenes on every side when the trees branch out with a free expansion and the bold prospect surprises with the heath the lawn the hill and valley in wild variety the littleness of tedious culture is unnecessary and trifling ornaments are unlooked for  i shall conclude with a passage from your own works do not blush sir to repent of your little inadvertencies it is hard but it is amiable to acknowledge our errors ne

     quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri sacra famcs virg the desire of acquiring money has in all ages actuated mankind and influenced their conduct in various shapes ever since civil polity framed different states and republics and since convenience stamped an imaginary value upon yellow dirt which soon rendered it by general consent a proper exchange for the rest of the commodities of the earth by the same means that it became useful in the ordinary necessaries of life it also in proportion administered to the luxuries and magnificent enjoyments of society the gamester soon learned to carry a thousand head of cattle by proxy to the dice room so many pieces of ore became the representatives of an adequate number of trees and things went on in this progression till at length a modern beau could carry as many sparkling acres upon his little finger as would have strained a thousand alaxes and hectors of the days of homer this last remark i am proud to fave an opportunity of making as the elegant species just mentioned have for some time unjustly been exposed to the railjery of the epilogue to the distressed mother whereas by this account the pretty fellows of these times have very visibly a superiority over the prowess and vigor of the much boasted ancient heroes  but to return an ambition to amass riches is certainly very laudable when it does not transgress the bounds which are prescribed by reason to all our passions in the general while it is conducted with a view to a competency and the enjoyment of the requisites for subsistence and comfort while it operates with a propensity to a mans friends relations and as milton has it all the charities of father son and brother and while it is the source of generosity and an extensive power of distributing benefits to mankind it is without any manner of doubt a just principle of action and though selflove is the pebble which stirs the lake the circles which it occasions will always be pleasing and beautiful to the moral sense  but the misfortune is this affection generally degenerates into meanness and has a fatal tendency to ruin the understanding and to corrupt the heart the intellectual soil must not lie fallow for any long time together and it is by freedom of converse and an habitual intercouse with the enlightened part of the world that a mental vigor is to be acquired and when the imagination is constantly attached to a particular set of ideas it becomes narrow by insensible degrees and for want of that general survey of the different objects which are continually passing on the scene of life it is confined to a small compass and never ventures to make the least excursion further from this close habit of thinking the heart too frequently contracts a lazy apathy and grows entirely callous to all manner of sensation our passions are involuntary and are nothing else than the impressions which external objects usually make upon the human imagination from the operations of which we feel those sundry emotions which are incitements to spur us on from theory to practice and which disclose themselves in our actions and are thence known to belong to the amiable train of benevolence or to be of the hateful family of selfishness and ill nature in proportion therefore as the ideas which pass in the mind are scanty the affections which agitate the heart will be fewer and both must at last rust to a point and fix in a state of unfeeling indolence  a love of money is at once the source of those deeds which carry with them a splendid appearance and those also which are at first sight mean and contemptible this passion has made many a writer of eminence and many scriblers in a garret it has animated the general at the head of an army and the clipper of coin in his twilight room it has for many ages thundered in the senate wrangled at the bar and lulled from the pulpit to this it is owing that the merchant boldly traverses the globe trusting to all the dangers of the turbulent element and that buckhorse will receive as many severe strokes of a cane as you please for sixpence apiece  the art generally practiced by people who are desirous either to amass an overgrown fortune or to glean up a livelihood without the talents to recommend themselves by striking out some new discovery or cultivating some advantageous branch of trade and commerce is to impose upon the credulity of mankind and by obtruding false delusive circumstances to excite their curiosity raise their admiration and thus guil them to comply with their artifices of fraud and imposition this metropolis has never wanted a sufficient number of these projectors and at present i believe i may affirm that it abounds with cheats and impostors in every station in every art and science and in every circumstance of life the solemn physician the specious lawyer the wordy critic and the bombast poet are found in all quarters of the town and though they must be allowed to be very notable masters of deceit i have

quarter of the town lives a regular physician who has spent many years abroad traveled all over mesopotamia and is returned home north about to practice his profession for the benefit of his countrymen is now entirely out of vogue and the cheat is laughed at by all degrees and ranks of people it is true there are many other plans on foot at present which are somewhat more plausible than that which i have now touched upon but among them all i do not remember any plan so well calculated to elevate and surprise to keep up a stare as a new one which came into my hands the other day as i

the conversation was taken up by one whom we soon discovered to be a jew bound for the rendezvous of many of the people of fashion with the double view of partaking of the diversions of the place and getting rid of a little french paste which lay upon his hands he harangued with great volubility of speech and he frequently embellished his discourse with many lively flashes of a diamond ring which played upon his finger amidst all his vivacity he took care to be sufficiently attentive to the grand business of selling the abovementioned paste which was with him so material a point that he never once mentioned the chief object which at present engrosses the thoughts of his whole nation but instead of favoring us with his political speculations he amused us with a sight of numberless pretty trinkets the beauties of which he explained with such an artful display of his finger and so many flourishes of speech that he soon closed a bargain with the fine lady whom i have already mentioned  the next person whom i shall mention was a young gentleman who from a slender figure and the recommendation of five and twenty years of age promised himself some success among the ladies

misfortune was that what he last recited opened new traces and he was sure to continue as long as his memory supplied him like the man at a fair who will spew you up ribband by the yard while there remains any in his mouth and this similitude i take to be very picturesque on the present occasion with this difference only that what the latter evacuates does not indicate a bad digestion whereas the former constantly discovers a foul stomach which cannot contain its crudities and on this account i take your ribband spewer to be much the more agreeable fellow of the two  the fifth and last of

favorable circumstances i shall employ this days paper in vindication of my pretty countrywomen  it may seem at first an extreme bold position if i assert that painting is not an importation of foreign refinement but originally of english growth and yet that this is the real state of the case is sufficiently known to the most supercial dabbler in history julius caesar in his account of the inroad which he made upon our ancestors gives a description of the aborigines of this island which i shall here translate the britons in general paint their bodies with woad which gives a blue incture to the skin and lends them a formidable affect in battle this i think may serve to obviate the imputation of imitating the french in this particular which i take to be a point of some consequence as by this we cannot be charged with the levity of having servilely copied from others we find that the ladies among the british picts went entirely naked and painted their bodies all over with the woad already mentioned this must undoubtedly have afforded great scope for fancy and in those days there must certainly have been many eager rivalships among the fair for preeminence in point of taste for painting for as the whole lovely body was ornamented with different figures and sundry various representations according as imagination suggested the variety of new fashions must have been extremely entertaining each fairone being studious to adapt to each different part of the body that degree of coloring and that form which must have proved most becoming just as our modern ladies adjust a patch so as to make the contrast striking and give stronger expressions to the adjacent features i have now by me the whole history of a british pict coquette found by a friend of mine among some ancient manuscripts and sent to me as a curiosity  cassibelana was the ladys name she lived in the capital of the trinobantes and was remarkable for a fine stature and an head of hair of a surprising length flowing in wanting luxuriance down her back she always had at her toilet some of the most exquisite woad that could be any where procured and she was celebrated for her curious art in preparing it for the purposes of adorning her person the woad being of itself of a blucish cast she would sometimes paint no part of her body but where the veins appeared and to them she gave such a delicate coloring that the pure and elequent blood as the poet calls it seemed to show itself through her translucent skin as soon as she had established this fashion and made the rest of her sex her imitators she would then suddenly change the mode and embellish her whole body with various devices  on the left side of her breast she would draw a young cupid aiming an arrow at her heart and on the right a lover languishing in amorous indolence each leg represented an admirer kneeling at her feet and imploring her compassion while she with all the complacence of selfapproving beauty let fall her eyes with indifference and cold disdain on her back were represented the emblematical figures of a train of pages following her in her way with all the officiousness of careful attendance on other parts of her person was presented to view venus in lovely attitude emerging from the sea the graces were also to be seen walking hand in hand their faces brightened with cheerfulness and mutual love in this manner she would attend at public sacrifices where all eyes were often fixed on her alone and frequently the venerable druid could not avoid even in the fervor of his devotion to cast a glance upon such an attractive profusion of charms  in this manner cassibelana captivated the hearts of all her male beholders who carved her name upon every oak in the country and the banks of thames reecchoed to the music of her name it was universally agreed that she was the best painter of her age her colors were warm and glowing her figures bold and striking and the natural motion of the different parts of her body made them appear still more animated and actuated as it were with the animal functions of real life an advantage which the most admired portraits of the most eminent painters since her days could never boast in all public places she entirely outshined the rest of her sex which made her the general envy of the ladies who frequently combined in parties of scandal to her disadvantage even though tea was not then known in these parts of the world cassibelana was every day pulled to pieces according to the modern phrase and though the ladies allowed that she really had a very lively fancy in all her drawings and an excellent design in all her drapery yet they could not see that she was so fine a woman though to be sure she had a pretty manner in putting on her things for so they expressed the covering of woad which served to conceal in some measure the natural superficies of her skin i am apt to believe that the transparent capuchin was imagined from a practice of this famous semale pict because at times she would lay on the woad in such a manner that mr popes line in his translation of homer may justly be applied to it her beauty seems and only seems to shade upon the whole cassibelana was leader of all the fashions even in kent the inhabitants of which were the most polished of all our islanders and as caesar tells us differed but little from the manners of the gauls in like manner as our modern fine ladies boast at present an exact conformity to french manners  from the foregoing account which i have rendered as close as possible from the manuscript now in my possession it appears that even in the days of the purest simplicity painting was the universal practice and therefore strongly am i inclined to think it laudable in the amiable sex at present i am further pleased to see the fashions of the ladies tending more rapidly every day to a greater similitude to the customs of our ancestors for it is very manifest that they are every day becoming more and more naked and it is observable that they who display most of their lovely bodies make the greatest use of paint which in my opinion is not used from a motive of female vanity but as a modest and decent covering to the skin i must by the way take notice that there is one circumstance in which the modern practice of painting differs from ancient simplicity i do not find in the account of any historian that the female british picts applied the least tincture of the woad to the natural complexion of their faces for a bloom and a vivacity of color they trusted to exercise fresh air and wholesome diet but as the fashionable vigils of gaming were unknown in those days it must be allowed that this is an improvement upon the fashions of our progenitors and indeed it could not be expected that in those rude times so elegant a diversion could be known for this we are indebted to modern refinement which has introduced improvements in manners as well as in arts and sciences  for my part i expect to see the time when the ladies will be to all intents and purposes as naked as our ancestors and in my apprehension if things proceed with equal celerity the period is not very distant as their clothes are amazingly reduced at both ends within these few years we shall not then complain that the importation of french hoops and french fashions of all sorts are a detriment to the nation mercers and milliners will be useless things and the ladies will spend the hours of the toilet in drawing and painting by which means i flatter myself that the british fair will be able to boast their guidos their titians and their raphaels to this end an ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance is now drawing up a system of directions to a female painter which will serve to aid their invention and give them a proper notion of design and coloring in all their faces by which means it is to be hoped they will greatly excel all the boasted masters in every school of painting  true

cause was opened by the attorney general of this court who set forth that the liberty of walking in the park has been allowed time out of mind unto all the good people of this metropolis and that to hinder any one from the said privilege is an infringement of the liberties of the subject and more particularly so in the present case as the exquisite beauty of the lady thus treated would command

de officiis at the last meeting of our club mr plastic the shaftsburian philosopher and chairman for the time being desired he might furnish the essay of this day  a taste for the imitative arts is the highest embellishment and ultimate finishing of an accomplished mind it gives an elegance to a mans way of thinking throws a polish on his manners and by insensible degrees refines the passions and affections of the soul it may be added that a fine taste is the inlet of some of the most delicate pleasures human life is susceptible of and may therefore properly be called in the language of shaftsourian philosopy the internal sense as by means of this faculty we are acquainted with many elegant sensations to which the generality of men seem to be entirely strangers this talent is not unlike the power of seeing just conferred on one whose eye never could distinguish colors it opens new traces of thinking awakens pleasing ideas and diffuses a complacence through the whole intellectual frame  there is nothing more common than to see men who perceiving the advantages which this elegant turn gives to a chosen few and observing that quickness of sensibility for which they are remarkable affect upon all occasions to be endowed with the same nice faculty of perception but the misfortune is they are absolutely callous to each fine impression and the method they choose to convince us of their delicacy is by pretending that nothing is refined enough for them thus while others distinguish themselves by yielding to the impulse of a passion artfully excited by a strain of music a poem or a picture these gentlemen would recommend themselves upon the strength of their having never been pleased at any rate this procedure is for the most part to be observed in modern critics or the malevoli a piece where every beauty of language and sentiment is united where in the striking passages every line is impassioned and swells with the emotion of the soul like glass in a furnace informed by the breath infused into it laid before one of this class shall be received with cold disdain and a composition of arnes full of all the sweetness of musical expression shall to their finer organs sound like the most jarring dissonance if a man in a club of gentlemen should be perpetually displeased with every thing while the rest of the members perceive no cause of complaint i apprehend there would be a strong presumption that his mouth was at those seasons greatly out of taste and with equal propriety whoever boasts an overrefinement of understanding should be set down without hesitation as one whose mental organs are distempered as matters are frequently managed a fine taste instead of being a power of receiving elegant sensations would prove an avenue for uneasiness discontent and a constant dislike of every thing around us and it would fare with this exquisite degree of intellectual feeling as with him whose external senses are framed to receive acuter impressions than our employments in life will admit  say what the use were finer optics given to inspect a mite not comprehend the heaven or touch if tremblingly alive all over to smart and agonize at every pore or quick effluvia darting through the brain die of a rose in aromatic pain pope but nature has not cast us in so delicate a mould both our bodily and mental powers are fitted to administer to our enjoyments and are by no means contrived to be the cause of fretfulness and a petulant peevishness which serve only to sour the temper and become troublesome and disagreeable in society  to define a true taste may be unnecessary at present as it has been often done by abler pens but i believe it will be judged pertinent to the subject in hand to give the reader some description of it mr lock observes that many abstract ideas are expressed by terms taken from the perceptions of our external senses such as to imagine comprehend conceive adhere etc which are all applied to modes of thinking in like manner the term now in question is derived from the sensation of our palate which we call taste and on account of some similitude in the operation i applied to the intellectual faculty by men of imagination in all languages the information given to the mind being in both cases rapid and instantaneous without waiting for the more cool and deliberate sentence of reflection  hence naturally arises a distinction between taste and judgment which are often used as synonymous expressions but are notwithstanding very different in themselves i believe many of my readers know people among their acquaintance who if you lay a picture before them upon mature deliberation and after comparing leisurely the copy with their own ideas of nature can pronounce the piece to be like without manifesting any particular relish or pleasure which is always a concomitant circumstance with the man of taste it is he that enters into the spirit and style of an author sees in an instant how he selects the circumstances in a description enjoys the turn of his expression and his art in seizing the passions and it is upon a review of what thus strikes the mind that the critics of all ages have been able to lay down rules for taste as theories of vision are framed from an examination of the organs of sight and the manner in which external objects operate upon them and hence the french wits have told us that nothing can be elegant which is not true upon an observation that the mind turns with distaste from any thing which contradicts its own ideas  it is recorded of marcus antoninus that he acknowledged it to the gods as a peculiar felicity that he had not cultivated his taste for works of imagination for fear they might have detained him from objects of higher importance but for my part i cannot help wondering that he did not rather thank heaven for the elegant turn bestowed upon him as it is certain that under due regulation a just taste is a constant source of the most refined gratifications  with this talent a man may retire into his closet and there enjoy a more delicious repast and better company than can be met with in any modern assembly homer never denies himself to any acquaintance and virgil is always easy of access whether you delight in sublime description or the softer beauties of rural imagery a man may take as much liberty with horace as his intruding friend did in the via sacra free from the same imputation of impertinence and without the expense of a remise you may visit boileau la fontaine vollaire and the politest of the french nation dr swift is always ready to shake your sides with humor you may converse with pope without hearing him complain of headaches and if you aspire to the company of a minister of state you may retire with bolingbroke into the cabinet there find him disclosing the secret springs of policy or receive a clue from him to guide you through the maze of history in short to a mind well harmonized all nature wears a pleasing aspect and the transition is easy from a relish for external beauty and the pleasures arising from poetry eloquence and the arts of imitation to a love for moral perfection and the dignity of character  this is the sentiment of cicero in the words of my motto and it is enforced by the author of the pleasures of imagination in such an exquisite strain of poetry that i must beg leave to conclude with transcribing the passage speaking of a man of taste he has the following lines   not a breeze flies over the meadow not a cloud imbibes the setting suns

been delightful to perceive him dart as quick as an arrow to its destined mark or with the celerity of a bird in the air from the place where the whole house imagined him destitute of the means of an escape into the opposite box and there stand laughing at his pursuers there was always such an exertion in his nervous system that  i dont know whether you ever saw an anatomy  but i can lend you an author upon the animal economy from whom it will appear manifestly upon the clearest principles how this was performed it would astonish you to hear the several accidents he met with when he was locked in arm over arm with another at the top of a scene they both fell down clasped in each others embrace and how do you think he escaped  with an amazing agility he turned his fellowperformer under him so that he came down quite easy while the other broke his collarbone  perhaps you never would be able to guess how many steps he made in running in a circular manner round the stage three thousand steps sir  the movement of each leg was so small and quick that in going the length of one foot he minced it so as to make three hundred steps  look ye sir wetting his finger here is a circle

on foot to work the little fellow the thing is we are to have an old pantomime entertainment new vamped with an additional scene of a scythian winterpiece which i am convinced will draw the whole town after it there are already several agents sent to russia to purchase a sufficient number of bears and a large quantity of ice is now actually making the ice sir will be disposed on the stage in large rocks and the beasts will be sent on shivering amidst the hoary frosts in one part of the scene the sun will be discovered but shorn of his beams as milton has it the rigid frost will be impervious to his rays and you will see the lightning play upon the impassive ice there will also be exhibited at a distance a lofty mountain from whose summit will come roaring down a tumultuous cataract loud and impetuous in its course and at the bottom will be placed a reservoir to collect the rushing torrent where it will form itself into a smooth expansive river which is to glide off in the sight of the spectators there will also be situated on the banks of the river a man with a fishingrod intent upon catching the tenants of the watery plain when on a sudden the audience will perceive the stream arrested in its course by the intenseness of the frost and the fishermans line made a prisoner for the remainder of the season the waterfall also will instantly be stopped by the gelid season and the spectators will have the pleasure of perceiving the pendant isicle this sir will be performed with ease though the manner of its operation will be imperceptible to the vulgar eye but there is no difficulty in the thing for as the torrent is to come down in sheets of water which will be represented with a glistening kind of tin it will be extremely practicable to stop the tin all at once and in that case the curious will admire the wonders of the liquid stone liquidi miracula saxi you know claudian talks of and to all this will be added several other ornaments that will tend greatly to

not a little with other contingent circumstances to render them ridiculous and indeed in this situation of the drama it is no wonder that they were looked upon as a set of low fellows by insensible degrees matters were improved to greater elegance though the old opprobrium still continued to adhere to the performers and perhaps their own way of life their own morals their own behavior and the appearance they every where made deserved that the first impression should not be effaced by the same means the prejudice has been derived down from age to age and till within these few years passed the laws which public opinion had established continued in full force till at length they were repealed in favor of the few whose life and conversation should deserve it mr pope talking of shakespeares time observes that as the best playhouses were then inns and taverns the globe the hope the red bull the fortune etc so the top of the profession were then mere players not gentlemen of the stage they were led into the buttery by the steward not placed at the lords table or ladys toilet and consequently were entirely deprived of those advantages they now enjoy in the familiar conversation of our nobility and an intimacy not to say dearness with people of the first condition  certain it is the sentiments of mankind have been very much changed in this respect of late years and indeed in all ages and among all men of sense the prejudice never had much weight whenever there appeared one abstracted from the common herd who besides the other qualities requisite in his business was possessed of a good understanding adorned and embellished with modesty decency and good manners thus we find among the romans roscius the player was held in general esteem by all men of taste and refinement cicero loved him living and at his decease paid an immortal tribute to his memory he omitted no opportunity of celebrating his name and in one of his most famous orations who is there says he among us of so rude and unfeeling a disposition as not to have been very sensibly affected at the death of roscius who though he died in an extreme old age on account of his excellent art and his every elegance deserved to be exempt from that debt of human nature  quis nostrum tam animo agresti ac duro fuit ut roscii morte nuper non commoveretur qui cum esset senex mortuus tamen propter excellentem artem ac venustatem videbatur omnino mori non debuisse mr betterton was also the friend the companion the favorite of a set of men who were the chief honor to our country dryden pope row addison congreve steel and the famous doctor radcliffe were the personages that received him with open arms and if mr garrick should never be able to boast such an exalted acquaintance it is for this only reason because it is hardly to be expected that such a set of men will again appear together  a complete actor appears so seldom in the world that i do not wonder whenever a real prometheus with true fire starts up among us at the tribute of admiration and applause which is paid to him by the general consent and so many requisites are necessary to form one who can thus extort the public approbation that i own i should not be surprised if this art rose much higher in the eyes of the judicious there are many external accomplishments which in other professions may be dispensed with but the fine performer must have a well formed person a graceful deportment a well turned face a just disposition of features and an eye expressive of the various subtle movements of the mind he must have improved the air of his whole person by an habitude and intercourse with gentlemen and he must add to all this a voice not only to articulate each syllable distinctly and with precision but also to deliver each sentence with grace and harmony  besides these external qualifications what a train of mental endowments is absolutely necessary a good understanding cultivated by a liberal education a true taste and relish for all the beauties in an author a just sense of every passage and the idea appropriated to each word a thorough knowledge of character an imagination warm and alive to each fine stroke of the oet a sensibility of temper properly susceptible of each passion the writer addresses himself to and a power of exciting that passion in others what and how great that power is the following passage in hamlet will better convey to the reader than any thing i have to offer on the subject is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion should so force his soul to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect a broken voice and a function suiting with forms to his conceit  from this account i apprehend it must appear that this profession should be reckoned among the liberal and imitative arts and at the same time i must observe that it cannot be thought too slightly of in those who repeat the mere words in a vacant unfeeling manner or whose art consists in a wry mouth or a burn on the jaw but when every look gesture and action is governed by the soul when the imagination is wrapped and the audience catch it by contagion when the artist imparts new motions to our spirits wrings the soul with fancied grief and fills us with imaginary terrors then we perceive a genius which cannot be too much admired i have often lamented that the poverty of our language does not afford a term sufficiently expressive to distinguish such a performer from the rest of his fraternity as i always study to avoid confusion in my ideas i endeavor to separate them in my own mind by words which appear to me to be best appropriated to them and till a better distinction is pointed out i would choose to call a person such as i have described an imitator or an actor and he who pretends to the art without any knowledge of nature should be set down a mere player  in this sense mr barry will always be accounted a fine actor and mrs cibber an actress of irresistible skill it would not be perhaps unentertaining to examine the list of dramatis personae belonging to each playhouse and when we should not find the actor alone it might be diverting to see how both are blended and to enquire which is prevalent but the reader if he approve the hint may pursue it in his own

hospitable roof if i remember right mr dryden was an admirer of the beautiful simplicity of this address as i have his volumes at hand i shall here transcribe the passage  honor our annual feast and take your seat with friendly welcome at a homely treat this sentiment however short the translation may be is highly admirable in the original and should be impressed in very lively and deep characters on every mans heart who is desirous of sharing the social pleasures of life  content is most certainly the surest source of an internal happiness it not only reconciles a person to himself but also to those with whom he converses to use shakespeares phrase it is the chief nourisher in lifes feast and when giddy mirth and noise have subsided this keeps on an equal tenor and if it never rises very high it has at least this advantage that it does not ebb so low as to leave shoals and rocks discovered mirth may properly be called an aurora borealis whereas good humor like a fixed star sheds a constant stream of light which if it does not dazzle has at least at all times a chearing influence  if good humor has this advantage annexed to it discontent must certainly be attended with many poignant inconveniences in the same proportion that ease endears and enlivens our days its reverse must bring on each morn in a turbulence of clouds the spirits are perpetually sinking and all the uses of this world as the poet has it seem to him weary stale flat and unprofitable the infection is always rankling in his breast and he lives in an unceasing state of hostility with himself and his neighbors this by degrees grows into a fixed habit and then a lowering invariable gloom hangs over his mind and as he does not feel any peace in his own inward frame he is not tender about the uneasiness he may create in anothers breast he therefere gives an unlimited vent to his sullenness and is ever finding fault with every thing around him  there is one circumstance which has a kind of tendency to alleviate this perversity of disposition and that is that the propensity to satyr which this sullenness gives the mind is often the occasion of starting new and uncommon remarks we sometimes hear from these kind of humourists strokes of a peevish pleasantry which are not unentertaining and as these people are ever fond of exhibiting a caricature of their acquaintances we now and then receive some sketches or pictures in miniature in which the coloring and the drapery are so whimsisically imagined that we really derive no small degree of diversion from their extravagant turn but notwithstanding this degree of mirth which they involuntarily excite it does not sufficiently compensate for the trouble they give for the most part a man who can find no relish in any thing should be banished from society he should be sent to an infirmary of valetudinarians and there be confined until he purges away his ill humors or until reason dispels the mist which has obscured his intellects  the sure way of pleasing in company is for a man to be pleased inwardly and he that is not so should retire and brood over his uneasiness and not become troublesome or invade the harmony of society i cannot help considering this fixed and permanent ill humor as a kind of blackjaundice through the dark medium of which every thing that passes takes a tincture i know a person at present

enemies to musidora as she preserved a discreet medium between a giddy freedom on the one hand and the reserve of hypocrisy on the other the verses were in a little time in every bodys hand and appius was declared to have a very fine turn for poetry the effect which this treatment had on musidoras mind is not to be described faded were the roses which before were blended with the lilly and that

honor are sacrificed to a jest where the men take a wanton pleasure in scandal and where the fair join in combination against truth and virtue  how people can thus become avowed enemies to their own happiness and so universally adopt a custom which certainly would be more honored in the breach than the observance is to me highly unaccountable it reminds me of the licentiousness used by the chorus

lord shaftsbury expresses it it sets us free from the fatigue of pursuing a long and regular tract of wellconcerted reasoning and may from its appearing in loose detached sentences seem to the reader to carry with it no great difficulty in the execution but it is nevertheless as hard as any other vehicle of instruction as it raises a demand for close sense and a lively turn of expression in almost

on any of our theaters since the manager of drury lane house withdrew a certain lady from the public eye  as soon as the goddesses were thus prepared for the solemnity apollo in all the pride of manly beauty advanced to the altar and paid his adoration this done the muses came forward in procession and after prostrating themselves in a respectful manner they mixed together in a dance and sung hymns

them were homer socrates plato sophocles and longinus aristotle having sent word that he was engaged in a syllogism and could not attend socrates who we are told called dancing a sacrifice to the graces immediately began a movement before the altar and plato eyed him with a steadfast look longinus having acquitted himself in the due forms of veneration fixed his attention on homer  lucretius was leader of the next division he thanked the graces for having scattered so many flowers amidst the thorns which shoot up in his part of parnassus terence who was always an elegant observer of forms

description of him in the temple of fame  gathering his flowing robe he seemed to stand in act to speak and graceful waved his hand he declared in a flowing style that from an habit of surveying the beauty of external objects the mind makes an easy transition to the fitness the order and regularity of its own inward frame and from a view of outward decorum it begins to acquire the same correctness and elegance in its own operations studiously careful not to think or do any thing unhandsomely from whence results that grace of character which is in its very nature highly eligible and praise worthy  virgil came forward with a modest mien and great regularity in his motion he desired to pass all his time with the graces and the muses and bowing respectfully thanked the graces for that elegant simplicity the molle atque facetum which they had conferred upon him he then retired to a laureat shade where he almost hid himself in illustrious ease statius lucan and silius italicus endeavored to walk in the same path after him and sometimes they even aimed at his footsteps but an awkward strut in their gate rendered it impracticable the goddesses told ovid that they were sorry they could not follow him into exile at the approach of horace venus and all the laughing loves smiled with peculiar pleasure tibullus was received with every token of affection and before he withdrew he begged leave to introduce mr hammond to their presence which was granted and accordingly mr hammond had the honor of kissing their hands  after this a pause ensued in the rites occasioned by the delay of several monks and fathers to whom a summon had been sent commanding their attendance they were all in a cluster at the foot of parnassus and they at length returned for answer that they did not choose to worship false deities after such a declaration it was with surprise i beheld a certain bishop lay aside his mitre and venerate the pagan goddesses  upon enquiring his name i found this personage to be the celebrated vida he was followed by erasmus strada bohours and several jesuits who were at length joined by boileou and la fontaine the former had a degree of severity mixed in his smiles and the latter was all quickness vivacity and wit in imitation of tibullus they begged leave to present their friends and accordingly garth prior and gay were introduced  shakespeare and milton came down from the highest eminence in parnassus to pay their respects but while they were performing their duty i observed they both raised their heads to look at a part of the heavens where there was a distant thunder dryden had not money to procure a sufficient quantity of frankincense but the graces accepted the intention for the deed convinced by several touches in his works that no one had a finer sense of beauty mr pope advanced with his eyes fixed upon homer who was then in company with virgil his look was thoughtful but bright and he delivered himself in the most harmonious numbers addison followed close at his heels and he acquitted himself in his peculiar manner of giving good sense all the embellishments of ease and artful negligence he observed how much good humor added to the beauty of the graces and he was pleased to see them without any fashionable edifice of hair on their heads and free from any enormous circle of the hoop  by this time a general whisper began to run through all the ranks owing as i soon perceived to the appearance of dr swift who approached with cadenus and vanessa in his hand as an offering to the graces as he drew nearer he sucked in his cheeks and the goddesses turned to each other with a smile upon his making an apology for some strokes in his works they assured him that they could overlook those singularities on account of his other admirable qualities and they added that what was formerly granted to virgil should be also allowed to him viz to toss about his dung with an air of gracefulness  lord shaftsbury was ready to yield all veneration to three goddesses who had always warmed his fancy with the brightest ideas this noble writer was succeeded by the lord viscount bolingbroke who by the way declared himself an enemy to all forms of worship he avowed at the same time that he was readier to pay adoration to those bright existences than to the god of moses or the god of paul on which topics he harangued with a roll of periods in which though he did not advance the strict truth he deserved at least to be called in the words of a witty satyrist a polite apostate from gods grace to wit  his lordship withdrew and i then perceived some certain modern periodical writers entering the temple they approached the altar with a college mien and a pompous affectation of learned industry though no charge could be brought against them for want of matter their style appeared too elaborate and their words frequently formed an exotic dialect of adventitious phrases by which means all ease was discarded from their writings and where ease is wanting grace will be always deficient  emboldened by the example of my brother writers methought i approached the altar but i was told by euphrosyne that i advanced with rather too great an air of negligence and the goddess advised me to avoid the appearance of thoughtlessness while i endeavored to be easy and graceful i was so stung with this reproach that my repose was instantly disturbed and when awakened i pleased myself in the reflection that the whole was but a dream  true intelligence on wednesday last miss grogram of cheapside had her ears bored for the

vauxhall gardens during the summerseason and he intends shortly to return to his station in the piazza covent garden when he will take care to supply his customers with watches handkerchiefs etc at

charles price porter at the bedford coffeehouse arrived at his seat at the lower end of the said coffee room from wales where he had been to visit his friends after an absence of several years

adventumque dei and sacrum expectare calorem paulisperque operi posito subducere mentem mutati donec redeat clementia coeli vida the author from whom i have selected the motto of this days paper was a poet of great elegance as well as a critic of the most refined taste he observes in his excellent art of poetry that the genius of writers is frequently very unequal their vigor often exhausted and their spirits sunk as if apollo and the muses had quite abandoned the tuneful breast and therefore he advises every author to call off his mind at proper seasons from the studies he is employed in in order to wait more propitious moments when the return of the poetic heat and the influence of the god may render his productions more animated  this precept certainly should be adhered to by all who presume to lay their lucubrations before the public but it often happens that the periodical essayist however inclined he may be to retouch and finish is compelled by necessity to dismiss the uncorrected sheet to the press for though the town may think they have a right to an authors whole time and that he should grow pale at the midnight lamp the better to make a part of their teaequipage in a morning it cannot but often be the case that business of some sort social connections and sundry various avocations shall obtrude themselves so as to render it impossible for a writer to comply with that respect he owes his readers for as it has been wittily said by sir richard steel an adventurer in this way is like a man who keeps a stagecoach he must set out whether there are passengers or not  i have sometimes since the commencement of the grays inn journal been curious after my own fame and on this account i have often seated myself in a snug part of a coffeehouse in order to collect the sentiments of the public concerning the present writer upon these occasions i have observed that no allowance is made for a temporary want of health an accidental depression of spirits to which all men are liable at times and i must add that it is not common for readers in coffee houses to make any abatement of their severity on account of the humor they may be in themselves their own want of ease and their usual cheerfulness i remember to have been damned by a well looking man because his wine was bad the night before and the fumes of it were still in his head an uxorious gentleman who is sometimes a little henpecked by his wife is sure never to relish me after a curtainlecture and the price of corn at bearkey has more than once lowered me in the estimation of a solid citizen add to these accidental contingencies the great variety of tasles which prevall in every company and which it is a moral impossibility for any writer to gratify at once i have occasionally entertained the town with essays of pleasantry and humor and the consequence is that it has raised a demand upon me every saturday for an equal vein of mirth because the temple of laverna has excited a general laugh it is asked upon entering a coffeeroom waiter has mr ranger given us any more detached scenes to day is there any thing immensly high o this is against suicide there is no fun here says another and a third exclaims pshaw this man is always laughing  cannot he be serious a little and give us something that has stuff in it  essays on taste and poets and humourists and monkeys and style here boy give me the gazetteer or the londondaily advertiser which ever is out of hand  a correspondent who writes to me from his house near litchfield begs to know why i have entirely discarded politics and has the following paragraph  why will not you have a fling at the times  a touch now and then upon the ministry and a stricture upon the constitution would have a pretty go down with us in the country  as it is now considently afferted that the jewbill will be repealed i have resolved with myself to be a tool to no party whatever and as to the care of our constitution i heartily recommand it to those who are entrusted with it  videant consules ucquid detrimenti res publica capiat  this paper was undertaken to contribute as far as the authors time and abilities would permit him to the entertainment or instruction of his readers to laugh out of countenance many of those foibles which are apt to shoot up in this metropolis to amuse the fair to promote decency and good manners and to detect impostors in writing criticism and many situations of life that this has succeeded far beyond his warmest hopes he is not backward to acknowledge he thinks himself obliged to his candid readers for the savourable reception they have hitherto been pleased to afford to the production of his leisure hours and though he is not inclinable to arrogate to himself any vanity on this head he is notwithstanding pleased in a particular degree to find that this his first attempt has gone on with growing reputation from the first out set to this present saturday without anticipating the public favor by pusss in the newspapers or by the address of emissaries who should considently assert that it was to be the joint labor and production of some of the best writers of the age without a combination of booksellers to support it by a subscription and without the patronage of any great man whatever the author always disdained such little artisices well knowing that if he had any wit to recommend him the public would return a degree of encouragement in proportion to their entertainment and on this account he has never been so industrious to insinuate that a very eminent hand was engaged that sir gecrge  wrote such an essay that my lord  diverted the choice spirits such a day that the last was very sine and came from the honorable  that the author of  contributed the exquisite entertainment in such a piece and that mr  the translator of  was certainly one of the gentlemen concerned in it and that his style could be easily traced in the respective pieces belonging to him  without these advantages the graysinn journal has found the way to amuse the town once a week for twelve months past and i may boast with perhaps sewer voluntary supplies than is generally afforded to authors on these occasions  however as i am not inclined to assume to myself any praise that my own conviction does not tell me is properly mine i must here let the public know that there is a person to whom i am frequently obliged for all the assistance he can contribute i shall not mention his name as i am persuaded it would not be agreeable to one of his modesty and delicate sense of things thus much i will hint that this personage is no other than the compositor of the press who finding that my occupations will not permit me to revise the paper myself is kind enough upon several occasions to alter words and sentences according to his own taste and whenever a phrase does not entirely please him the reader is sure to see something substituted in its room for instance i had occasion to mention some time since a treaty of marriage which this gentleman converted into a treatise of marriage and the readers own observation will point out to him several elegancies of this nature upon other occasions all which embellishments of style i beg may be invariably attributed to the abovementioned compositor of the press of whom i shall say no more at present but as the printers devil is now with me for this lucubration i shall conclude with a return of my sincere thanks to the public for the encouragement they have afforded me during the course of this volume with a grateful sense of which i here take my leave and remain until next saturday the candid readers  most obedient and very humble servant charles ranger  true intelligence from my register office during the course of this volume i have made the best use i could of most of the contributions that have been committed to my care and with regard to those now in my hands which i do not think coincident with my plan i beg leave to give the following answer to the respective authors  to the writer of an essay on the british herringfishery signed john shotten  this piece may not be improper for the gazetteer  to the author of a paragraph of scandal and defamation  this with two shillings be the character traduced ever so reputable will be received by the daily advertiser  to the author of a proposal for better illuminating the cities of london and westminster  this may not be improper for the westminster journal  to the gentleman who sent a paragraph with only the initial and final letters of each word  this will make no  fgure in the london evening post  to the author of six essays on the following subjects nothing himself whi syllable himself elizabeth caaning himself again  these six pieces will save the inspector a  roule  having thus balianced my books and made out an inventory of my wits i find i have a sufficient stock in trade after paying every body to carry on my business and therefore i shall continue a retailer every saturday for one year more when if i meet with suitable encouragement i shall turn wholesale dealer and fell my pieces in the lump  advertisement if any small wit should be fond of punning upon the word lump by hinting that ranger is a lumpish author etc he shall be prosecuted in the court of consorial enquiry according to the statute in that case made and provided  the end of the first volume
