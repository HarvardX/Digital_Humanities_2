observations on soame jenynss view of the internal evidence of the christian religion addressed to its almostchristian author by w kenrick ll d  i would to god that not only thou but also all that

jenyns esquire sir apologies for the liberties we take with individuals when the interests of all mankind are at stake are as frivolous as they are impertinent i shall make none therefore for such as are taken in the following observations on your late view of the internal evidence of the christian religion  the subject indeed is of such high debate and its design of such superior dignity that even the decency of decorum requires the banishment of unmeaning ceremony  st paul tho a prisoner and in bonds stood upon none even with king agrippa on his judgment seat when on the presumption of that princely personages being almost a christian he wished that not only he but all his hearers were altogether such  whether my arguments are sufficiently forcible or are properly calculated to be in any degree instrumental to the accomplishment of a similar wish must be determined by their influence on my readers among whom i presume sir you will be one of the most respectable whatever be the result therefore i shall add to the other liberties i have taken that of congratulating you who once confessedly believed as little as others on the promising progress you have already made in becoming almost what i confidently trust you will through superior influence sooner or later altogether be a christian as far as is consistent with which character  i am sir your most obedient humble servant w kenrick  advertisement the extraordinary demand for the appendix to the third volume of the london review in which a slight sketch of the following observations was first printed having suggested to the author that their republication in a more commodious form would be acceptable to the public he was led to a more considerate revisal of the tract which gave rise to them the slips and inadvertencies which appeared on such revisal to have escaped him in the hurry of composition acquiring consequence from the importance of the subject urged also a kind of necessity for such republication  the desire of atoning for the defects of that hasty critique induced him therefore to enlarge on the more interesting parts of the view and to digest the whole of his observations on it into a more methodical and regular form  the observer was the more readily induced to this by an apparent deficiency of method in mr jenynss tract though professedly calculated for the perusal of the busy and the idle who may be comprised under those who have but little time to read and those who read but little at a time for whose convenience therefore the matter is here so managed by a proper subdivision of the subject that the reader be he as busy or as idle as he will may take up or lay down the book at pleasure without running any risk of losing without recovery the thread of its argument  contents sect i on the subject scope and design of the writers argument in general viz to prove the truth by demonstrating the divine origin of the christian religion  the most convincing proofs pretended to amount but to a mere probability page   sect ii on the definition of the subject and division of the argument into four propositions  the first that there is now extant a book entitled the new testament shown to be futile and frivolous page    sect iii on the second proposition viz that from this book may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only superior to but unlike every thing which had ever before entered the human mind  this proposition shown to be very obscurely illustrated inconsistently explained and even of little consequence to the general argument were it capable of being proved page    sect iv on the third proposition that from this book may likewise be collected a system of ethics in which every moral precept founded on reason is carried to a higher degree of perfection than in any other of the wisest philosophers of preceding ages every precept founded on false principles is totally omitted and many new precepts added peculiarly corresponding with the new object of this religion  this proposition shown to be very exceptionably illustrated affording at best rather a proof of the sublimity and purity of christian morals and of the advantages rather than the truth of the christian religion page    sect v on the fourth or conclusive proposition that such a system of religion and morality could not possibly have been the work of any man or set of men much less of those obscure and illiterate persons who actually did discover and publish it to the world and that therefore it must undoubtedly have been effected by the interposition of divine power that is it must derive its origin from god  this proposition shown to contain only corollaries of the preceding propositions and though true as to fact and therefore admitted ex gratia still problematical in argument page    sect vi on the writers general conclusions and his notions concerning the essential objects of the christian faith  till these objects are precisely determined the determination of the question respecting their divine origin of little importance page  0  sect vii on the objections that have been made to the divinity and veracity of the christian religion and particularly to objection the first viz that divine revelation is incredible because unnecessary because the reason which god has bestowed on mankind is sufficiently able to discover all the religious and moral duties which he requires of them if they will but attend to her precepts and be guided by her friendly admonitions  this objection shown to be neither properly stated nor satisfactorily removed page     sect viii on his reply to a second objection that the old and new testament cannot be a revelation from god because in them are to be found errors and inconsistencies fabulous stories false facts and false philosophy which can never be derived from the fountain of all truth  this objection shown to be rather enforced by the authors concessions than removed by his conclusions page     sect ix on his reply to a third objection that a wise and benevolent creator should have constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another under the term religion in this objection the author is shown to include morals also but the purity of the christian morals is shown not to be calculated for the constitution of this world and therefore not required of christians in their present state of probation page     sect x on his reply to a fourth objection that if this revelation had really been from god his infinite power and goodness could never have suffered it to have been so soon perverted from its original purity to have continued in a state of corruption through the course of so many ages and at last to have proved so ineffectual to the reformation of mankind  the manner in which this objection is attempted to be removed shown to reflect the highest indignity on the divine author of the christian religion as well as on that religion itself page     sect xi on his reply to the fifth objection the incredibility of some of its doctrines particularly those concerning the trinity and atonement for sin by the sufferings and death of christ the one contradicting all the principles of human reason and the other all our ideas of natural justice  this objection shown to be rather evaded than solved the author not having fairly and fully stated the difficulties it really contains page     sect xii on his reply to the sixth objection that however true these doctrines may be yet it must be inconsistent with the justice and goodness of the creator to require from his creatures the belief of propositions which contradict or are above the reach of that reason which he has thought proper to bestow on them  this objection answered by denying that genuine christianity requires any such belief  the nature of the christian faith investigated and its latitude defined christianity as it requires nothing impracticable to be performed so it requires nothing impossible to be believed page   0 ect xiii on his reply to the seventh objection that the whole scheme of revelation is partial false fluctuating unjust and unworthy of an omniscient and omnipotent author page     sect xiv general reflections on the whole argument and conclusion in favor of universal candor in judging of the faith and morals of others or the exertion of christian charity toward all mankind page  0  observations on a view of the internal evidence of the christian religion sect i on the subject scope and design of the writers argument in general viz to prove the truth by demonstrating the divine origin of the christian religion  the most convincing proofs pretended to amount but to a mere probability  among the many attempts to recommend and accommodate the profound mysteries of divine wisdom to the shallow comprehension of the human understanding the present is by no means the least promising or plausible but the impossible necessarily includes the impracticable and all attempts to reconcile objects that are in their very essence irreconcilable must ever be ineffectual in pride in reasoning pride our error lies all quit their sphere and rush into the skies aspiring to be gods if angels fell aspiring to be angels men rebel   hence nothing can be more reprehensible than the arrogance of our modern rationalists in cavilling at every thing in revelation that is not reconcilable to reason and in denying every thing to be religious that is not rational tenacious of the name of christians as they are of the principles of heathens they want to newmodel the system of christianity by expunging all those doctrines which they cannot reconcile to their newsangled scheme of rationality but alas their reasoning faculties are too confined to soar above  this visible diurnal sphere so that after all they must sit down content with a religion which entitles them to no better an appellation than that of honest heathens or give up even their nominal title to christianity and honestly confess themselves real infidels  let them choose but the time seems to be approaching when they must make their choice the christian world is no longer to be deceived by these wolves in sheeps clothing these believers in the name of a savior whose power of salvation they openly deny  there is so much disingenuousness and sophistry in the practices of these minute philosophers that we are particularly sorry to see them kept in countenance by the misapplied abilities of more ingenious and ingenuous writers  it has indeed been publicly hinted that this little work is a mere controversial bubble blown up to amuse wellmeaning christians in order to impose on their credulity and raise a sneer at the expense of their simplicity and sincerity  for our own part we have a better opinion of the author than to give credit to such a suggestion his rank and reputation in life as well as in literature forbid our entertaining a thought so derogatory to his character as a man of sense honor and probity for his christianity it is true we have hitherto given him credit but as he now professes himself religiously solvent we shall take the liberty of investigating the terms of payment by a particular and impartial review of his present performance  before we begin this investigation however it may not be amiss to enter a caveat against the readers giving credit to the argument merely on the authority of the writer the good faith of the latter respects himself alone the validity of his reasoning only respects the reader  should his work he says ever have the honor to be admitted into such good company as the busy or the idle they will immediately determine it to be that of some enthusiast or methodist son beggar or some madman i shall therefore says he beg leave to assure them that the author is very far removed from all these characters that he once perhaps believed as little as themselves this intimation of our authors puts us in mind of old gresset one of the beauxesprits esprits and as he long affected to be thought the espritsforts of france having outlived his passions and almost his vanity which is saying a great deal of a frenchman he retired in disgust to a monastery and turned enthusiast alleging as the strongest proof of the propriety of his new creed the impropriety of his former infidelity  but having some leisure and more curiosity he employed them both in resolving a question which seemed to him of some importance  whether christianity was really an imposture founded on an absurd incredible and obsolete fable as many suppose it or whether it is what it pretends to be a revelation communicated to mankind by the interposition of supernatural power on a candid enquiry he soon found that the first was an absolute impossibility and that its pretensions to the latter were founded on the most solid grounds in the further pursuit of his examination he perceived at every step new lights arising and some of the brightest from parts of it the most obscure but productive of the clearest proofs because equally beyond the power of human artifice to invent and human reason to discover  that the brightest lights and clearest proofs should arise from the most obscure parts of scripture is as singular as is the reason given for it viz because they are beyond the power of human artifice to invent and human reason to discover but may we not ask here how our author could assign so notable a reason without having himself carried human artifice and human reason to their utmost extent of discovery and invention how else should he find this discovery and invention to be an absolute impossibility  if indeed he meant to infinuate that he has carried the powers of investigation so far as this well and good the improvements of art the progress of science are at an end  but we must have stronger proof of the fact than a mere ipsedixit in a matter of so much importance  that it is of consequence to the reader to know that the author is not an enthusiast or a madman we admit but why we are told he is not a methodist or a beggar we do not readily conceive is any doctrine the less true because it is taught by a methodist is any argument the less valid because it is urged by a beggar or would the same doctrine be more true if maintained by a metropolitan or the same argument more valid if urged by a nabob  our savior and his apostles were men of eminence neither in church nor state they were neither highpriests nor lords of trade neither men of credit nor men of fortune nor do we see any incongruity in a very credible mans being a methodist and a very sound reasoners being as poor as job  it is more to the purpose that we are told the author is not an enthusiast or a madman but who tells us this  the very man himself  and who ever took a mans own word for his not being in a state of insanity or intoxication  i drunk says drunken cassio in the play no sir  this is my right hand and this is my left  at the same time mistaking one for the other  we do not say this is actually the case with our author but we say that his own asseveration merely cannot be admitted as evidence to the contrary from his own confession it appears he is a convert from infidelity now all converts are apt to run into extremes and from excess of incredulity to become too credulous from doubting and disbelieving what is probably true they affect to believe what is palpably false nay from denying almost every thing they come really to believe almost any thing  new converts we say are apt through inordinate zeal to give into excess of credulity a conduct which however pious certainly borders on enthusiasm indeed we cannot help thinking our author betrays a little tincture of it in his paradoxical observation respecting divine revelation in general when he says all circumstances considered if it were in every part familiar to our understandings and consonant to our reason we should have great cause to suspect its divine authority and therefore had this revelation been less incomprehensible it would certainly have been more incredible  that is in plainer terms if we understood it more we should be apt to believe it less  is not this on the plan of credo quia impossible esti believe it because it is impossible and does our author give this as a proof that he is in no degree touched with enthusiasm or insanity  credat judoeus appella  we say not haud nos because charity though it fears all things hops all things  to prove the truth of the christian religion says he we should begin by showing the internal marks of divinity which are stamped upon it should not a stamp upon a thing be rather called an external than internal mark  because on this the credibility of the prophecies and miracles in a great measure depends for if we have once reason to be convinced that this religion is derived from a supernatural origin prophecies and miracles will become so far from being incredible that it will be highly probable that a supernatural revelation should be foretold and enforced by supernatural means  not that our author professedly means to depreciate the proofs of the truth of the christian religion arising from either prophecies or miracles they both have or ought to have he says their proper weight let us weigh them then in his own balance  prophecies he says are permanent miracles whose authority is sufficiently confirmed by their completion and are therefore solid proofs of the supernatural origin of a religion whose truth they were intended to justify such are those to be found in various parts of the scriptures relative to the coming of the messiah the destruction of jerusalem and the unexampled state in which the jews have ever since continued all so circumstantially descriptive of the events that they seem rather histories of past than predictions of future transactions and whoever will seriously consider the immense distance of time between some of them and the events which they foretell the uninterrupted chain by which they are connected for many thousand years how exactly they correspond with those events and how totally unapplicable they are to all others in the history of mankind i say whoever considers these circumstances he will scarcely be persuaded to believe that they can be the productions of preceding artifice or posterior application or can entertain the least doubt of their being derived from supernatural inspiration  now this is so far from being true that we ourselves and we dare say many others have seriously considered all these circumstances and notwithstanding the pains ingenious interpreters have taken to develope conciliate and harmonize them we do still look upon them taken in a mere rational view to be so imperfectly ascertained and so doubtfully applied that judging of them merely from reason they do not strike us with any thing like that force of conviction which they appear to carry with our author  as to the miracles recorded in the new testament to have been performed by christ and his apostles he says they were certainly convincing proofs of their divine commission to those who saw them and as they were seen by such numbers and are as well attested as other historical facts and above all as they were wrought on so great and so wonderful an occasion they must still be admitted as evidence of no inconsiderable force  here again this writer either equivocates or sins against the truth the miracles performed by christ and his apostles were not certainly convincing proofs of their divine mission to many of those who saw them witness our viours dreadful denunciation to whole cities of impenitent unbelievers to choraizin bethsaida and capernaum in which his mighty works had been displayed unless indeed we are to suppose their impenitency not the consequence of their unbelief but that they were so much worse than the devils who believe and tremble in that they believed and trembled not but with the scribes and pharisees who seeing him work miracles immediately consulted to destroy him and said he cast out devils through beelzebub the prince of devils were those miracles we say convincing proofs of his divine mission to them  it even appears that our savior wrought his miracles and preached his doctrines in the sight and hearing of many who were never intended to be convinced by them this our author himself observes in accounting for that want of irresistible evidence of their truth by which they might possibly have been enforced quoting from the evangelist mark the following declaration of jesus to his desciples to you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand and left at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them  what weight or degree of force then does our author give to the evidence of miracles surely no considerable weight if he thinks as he says that they must now depend for much of their credibility on the truth of that religion whose credibility they were at first intended to support  how are the religion and the miracles to be made reciprocally the criterion of each other are the pillars of support on which the truth of christianity has so long rested to be now themselves supported by the strength and symmetry of its superstructure this is making the whole hang by geometry indeed   the internal marks of the divine origin of christianity are to give a credibility to the prophecies and miracles which they in turn are to reflect back on christianity to do credit to its divine origin if this be not reasoning in a circle and beating round the bush of argument to no end we at least see no end to such a mode of argument it is like that of the worlds being supported by an elephant the elephant by a tortoise the tortoise by another elephant and the other elephant by another world  in regard to the prediction of prophecies and the working of miracles it may indeed be justly objected as it has often been that the completion of a prophecy or the performance of a miracle taken merely as a fact however wonderful does not necessarily infer the interposition of a supernatural agent think not lorenzo nature strays whenever the world is in amaze for say that miracles there be may not they be only such to thee so many links concealed remain which form the complicated chain true causes and effects between in natures providential scene ep to lorenzo we shall take the liberty in the course of this critique to refer the reader more than once to the epistles to lorenzo not to indulge the vanity of an author in quoting from himself but to show that the critic is no new convert being much of the same opinion respecting these matters after upwards of twenty years expense and reflection as he was of so long ago and at a very early period of life   but granting that it did and that such completion of the prophecies and performance of miracles are as well attested as other historical facts such attestation they may have and yet if they have no more they cannot lay claim to more than a mere moral probability of truth  the difficulty of ascertaining the truth of probable and ordinary facts which happen daily almost under our immediate observation is so notorious that it is a sufficient caution against the putting implicit faith in the historical relation of facts improbable and extraordinary which are said to have happened at such a considerable distance of time and place  the weight or degree of force therefore which our author gives to the evidence of prophecies must notwithstanding he styles it not inconsiderable be little worth consideration  the utmost that he proposes indeed is a high probability and even this depends on our having other reasons to be convinced that christianity is of divine origin a foundation itself far short of the necessary proof in some cases for men may often have reason to believe what is nevertheless not actually true  even the internal evidence this writer attempts to investigate appears hence to amount to a mere probability so that by adding this evidence to those of both prophecies and miracles he is at best only adding one probability to another  sect ii on the definition of the subject and division of the argument into four propositions  the first that there is now extant a book entitled the new testament shown to be futile and frivolous  what pure christianity is says this writer divested of all its ornaments appendages and corruption i pretend not to say but what it is not will venture to affirm which is that it is not the offspring of fraud or fiction that however fraud and fiction may have grown up with it yet it never could have been grafted on the same stock nor planted by the same hand  this our author undertakes to show by stating the following plain and as he styles them undeniable but if undeniable why all this trouble to state and explain them propositions  first that there is now extant a book entitled the new testament  secondly that from this book may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only infinitely superior to but unlike every thing which had ever before entered into the mind of man  thirdly that from this book may likewise be collected a system of ethics in which every moral precept founded on reason is carried to a higher degree of purity and perfection than in any other of the wisest philosophers of preceding ages every moral precept founded on false principles is totally omitted and many new precepts added peculiarly corresponding with the new object of this religion  lastly that such a system of religion and morality could not possibly have been the work of any man or set of men much less of those obscure ignorant and illiterate persons who actually did discover and publish it to the world and that therefore it must undoubtedly have been effected by the interposition of divine power that is that it must derive its origin from god  such is this writers plan as exhibited by himself on which we beg leave first to observe that the terms in which it is laid down are too vague and the style too metaphorical for a logical essay the form of which it affects to assume  one would imagine that a casuist so rigid as to think it necessary to offer the mere existence of a book entitled the new testament as a formal proposition would have been strict enough to set out with as formal a definition of the enthymeme or object itself in contemplation  the design in view is professedly to prove the truth of the christian religion and yet what pure christianity is divested of all its ornaments appendages and corruption the writer will not pretend to say  does our logician then predicate nothing of his subject  yes though he will not pretend to say what pure christianity is he will venture to affirm what it is not his affirmation how ever is not even a negative predicate of its essence or property but an assertion relative to its derivation it is not the offspring of fraud or fiction  fraud and fiction may have grown up with it yet it never could have been grafted upon the same stock nor planted by the same hand  these metaphorical expressions we say are ill adapted to the subject in hand which requires simple unequivocating and precise terms not liable to misconception or mistake we cannot help thinking it also extremely illogical to undertake to prove what any thing may be imputed to as its cause without being able to give some definition of the thing itself as an effect to affirm positively what and show whence it is not derived without pretending to know what it is is certainly not a very philosophical however popular mode it may be of theological controversy  but to accommodate our review to the view itself as to this proposition the first very little as the author hints need be said it is a plain fact which cannot be denied such writings do now exist the less need therefore as before observed to give it the formality of a proposition either to be proved or granted we pass it over therefore as futile and frivolous  sect iii on the second proposition viz that from this book may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only superior to but unlike every thing which had ever before entered the human mind  this proposition shown to be very obscurely illustrated inconsistently explained and even of little consequence to the general argument were it capable of being proved  my second proposition says our author is not quite so simple but i think not less undeniable than the former and is this that from this book may be extracted a system of religion entirely new both with regard to the object and the doctrines not only infinitely superior to but totally unlike every thing which had ever before entered into the mind of man i say extracted because all the doctrines of this religion having been delivered at various times and on various occasions and here only historically recorded no uniform or regular system of theology is here to be found and better perhaps it had been if less labor had been employed by the learned to bend and twist these divine materials into the polished forms of human systems to which they never will submit and for which they were never intended by their great author why he chose not to leave any such behind him we know not but it might possibly be because he knew that the imperfection of man was incapable of receiving such a system and that we are more properly and more safely conducted by the distant and scattered rays than by the too powerful sunshine of divine illumination  our author expresses himself here also in terms very vague and equivovocal a system of religion he says may be extracted from the new testament infinitely superior superior in what respect to every other and yet no uniform or regular system of theology is to be found there and it had been better perhaps if the learned had never attempted to form such systems being probably incompatible with the divine economy respecting mankind  here is a probability suggested that is very high indeed he might almost as well have suggested that the divine economy itself is not systematical  equally paradoxical with a former illustration see page   also is the present as before the brightest lights arose from the most obscure parts of revelation so here we are to be more safely conducted in the dark than we should be in the brightest sunshine of divine illumination  there is likewise a palpable inconsistency on the very face of the proposition itself how can a system of religion be extracted from a book in which no such system is to be found  or means our author only that the form of that system is not to be found there but what of that every doctrine that is sound must be systematical whether the declaration or explication of it be formally so or not  it is customary for writers either from literary incapacity or to save themselves trouble to deliver their sentiments however consistent and connected with each other in a loose unconnected and desultory manner historians now i readily acknowledge says our author that the scriptures are not revelations from god but the history of them see view page     in particular must from the very nature of their composition blend doctrinal precepts with practical narration but if the precepts thus interspersed in the course of the narrative are inconsistent in themselves or incompatible with each other they can neither be truly doctrinal nor doctrinally true  men may write as loosely and desultorily as they please but if they think justly they must think consistently and of course systematically nor do we see the least reason except that of our authors desire to accommodate things at any rate to his own system for supposing that mankind are through any imperfection more incapable of receiving doctrines in a systematical form than they are of receiving them in no form at all as good a logician and as good a christian as our author tells us the best way to learn any science is to begin with a system the late dr watts   as to this authors metaphorical allusion to the rays of light it elucidates nothing that a moderate portion of light is better adapted to weak optics than an excessive blaze of it is undoubtedly true but the supposition thence deduced of our seeing better by means of distant scattered rays than by a regular emanation is a rhetorical flourish altogether inconsistent with sound logic and true philosophy  in regard to the bending and twisting of the materials of divine revelation into the polished forms of human systems to which they never will submit the attempt so to twist and bend them is certainly an unjustifiable violence which it might have been better the learned had never made but this is no reasonable objection to their forming a plain unpolished system such as is really contained in the scriptures  whether any system of scriptural thinking already reduced to form in writing be in all respects unexceptionable it is not our business here to enquire but if there be not it is in this particular we trace the source of imperfection it lies in the incapacity of men to form such a divine system to connect detached and desultory doctrines into a regular and consistent theory and not to their incapacity of comprehending such a theory had it been formally digested and in such form first given them  in respect to the total novelty and unheard of singularity of the doctrines of revelation when first promulgated our author affirms that those doctrines are equally new with the object and contain ideas of god and of man of the present and of a future life and of the relations which all these bear to each other totally unheard of and quite dissimilar from any which had ever been thought on previous to its publication  but continues he whether these wonderful doctrines which he enumerates are worthy of our belief must depend on the opinion which we entertain of the authority of those who published them to the world certain it is that they are all so far removed from every tract of the human imagination that it seems equally impossible that they should ever have been derived from the knowledge or artifice of man  now to us there seems no such impossibility even granting in opposition to the son of wisdom that there is any thing new under the sun and that there is nothing in the tract entitled christianity as old as the creation admitting we say that the christian religion when promulgated by our savior was as new and strange as our author represents it we think little stress of argument is to be laid upon such singularity or novelty  we shall not go about to enquire whether the extravagancies of the pagan mythology many of which certainly bear some resemblance to the sublime mysteries of christianity were of later or earlier origin yet wonderful as are the latter and firmly as we believe them derived from god being in their execution superior to human comprehension and totally incompatible with human reason we do not see any thing merely in the idea or design of the sublimest of them so far superior to the powers of human invention or dissimular to its sublimer conceptions on the contrary man has made to himself so many inventions human genius has soared so high into the region of impossibilities that nothing which can come within the association of the most incongruous ideas can in our opinion be justly said to exceed the artifice of the human imagination and yet this appears to be all the superiority suggested both the object and the doctrines says the author are not only infinitely superior to but totally unlike every thing which had ever before entered into the mind of man and again the doctrines of this religion contain ideas etc quite dissimilar from any which had ever been thought on previous to its publication  thus it appears to be in the thought and not in the deed of the mystery of salvation that according to this writer the superiority contended for consists   to attend however a little to the authors mode of proving his proposition to say the truth says he before the appearance of christianity there existed nothing like religion on the face of the earth the jewish only excepted all other nations were immersed in the grossest idolatry  at this time christianity broke forth from the east like a rising sun and dispelled this universal darkness which obscured every part of the globe and even at this day prevails in all those remoter regions to which its salutary influence has not as yet extended from all those which it has reached it has notwithstanding its corruptions banished all those enormities and introduced a more rational tional devotion and purer morals it has taught men the unity and attributes of the supreme being the remission of sins the resurrection of the dead life everlasting and the kingdom of heaven doctrines as inconceivable to the wisest of mankind antecedent to its appearance as the newtonian system is at this day to the most ignorant tribes of savages in the wilds of america doctrines which human reason never could have discovered but which when discovered coincide with and are confirmed by it and which though beyond the reach of all the learning and penetration of plato aristotle and cicero are now clearly laid open to the eye of every peasant and mechanic with the bible in his hand these are all plain facts too glaring to be contradicted and theresore whatever we may think of the authority of these books the relations which they contain or the inspiration of their authors of these facts no man who has eyes to read or ears to hear can entertain a doubt because there are the books and in them there is this religion  doubtless all this is well said it is pity it is not all quite so true but the truth is that these plain facts which our author says are too glaring to be contradicted are glaringly contradicted every day  it is not only denied that the doctrines of the christian faith coincide with and are confirmed by reason but it is denied by many that the devotion actually introduced by christianity is more rational or the morals purer than those professed and practiced by some people who never heard of christianity if we believe modern history for which we have certainly as good authority as for the ancient there have been found savage nations if so we may call them whose simplicity and purity both of religion and morals have been remarkable the plain peruvian pure in heart strange to the guile and guilt of art unawed by tenet text or tale erects his temple in the vale sacred to the universal mind the guardiangod of humankind no firstlings here affront the skies no clouds of smoking incense rise no hypocrite with doubtful face no convert tortured into grace no solid skull in wisdoms cowl no hooded hawk nor solemn owl nor blind nor ominous invade this spotless consecrated shade but like the native of the spray man hails his maker with the day by nature taught heaven asks no more in spirit and in truth adore ep to lor   we urge nothing against the purity of those morals now in practice throughout christendom nor compare them with those of other nations now existing who have not embraced christianity  the comparison might be looked upon as too severe a libel on the good christians of the age but might not an able casuist and as good a rhetorician as our author as plausibly declaim in favor of the conquerors legislators and moralists of unenlightened paganism to the shame of the immorality of professed christians  might he not exhibit a picture of horror faithfully drawn from the history of christianity and the propagation of our holy religion still more shocking to humanity and contradictory to its divine precepts than is afforded from that of the most horrid era in the annals of heathenism  has the savage fury of hostile barbarians the avarice of insatiable tyrants or the boundless ambition of heathen conquerors been the cause of more bloodshed or greater cruelty than the zeal of religious fanatics the phrenzy of pious enthusiasm or the pride and avarice of christian priests  might not an artful declaimer we say very reasonably pretend that a religion whose professors have been guilty of so much wickedness could not possibly merit the epithets of divine or holy would he not rather derive it from hell as its most natural source than from heaven the declared fountain of mercy and goodness  declamations of this kind prove nothing  we shall proceed therefore to the consideration of the authors third proposition leaving that of his farther proof of the second till we come to his solving of objections where indeed much of it would have with more propriety found a place  sect iv on the third proposition that from this book may likewise be collected a system of ethics in which every moral precept founded on reason is carried to a higher degree of perfection than in any other of the wisest philosophers of preceding ages every precept founded on false principles is totally omitted and many new precepts added peculiarly corresponding with the new object of this religion  this proposition shown to be very exceptionably illustrated affording at best rather a proof of the sublimity and purity of christian morals and of the advantages rather than the truth of the christian religion  in proof of this third proposition our author begins by making a distinction between the moral precepts of christianity founded as he observes on reason and those precepts which being founded on false principles inculcate in fact no virtues at all under the former he includes piety to god benevolence to man justice charity temperance and sobriety with all those which prohibit the contrary vices and all that debase our natures and by mutual injuries introduce universal disorder and consequently universal misery under the latter he classes those fictitious virtues which he says produce no salutary effects and however admired are no virtues at all such as valor patriotism and friendship  the monthly reviewers in their critique on our authors work observe on this distinction that they never conceived that the virtues of friendship fortitude and patriotism do not form a part of the moral system of the gospel much less could they have urged the want of these virtues as a peculiar recommendation of its excellence they are conspicuously illustrated say they in the character of its author and it would be easy to produce striking instances in which his courage and friendship and concern for the welfare of his country were actually displayed but this is needless the advocates of the christian religion in answer to lord shaftesbury and others have sufficiently vindicated it in this respect these are unquestionably virtues of considerable importance and so far as they do not interfere with the general principles of benevolence which christianity inculcates they constitute a part of christian morality  it is well for these distinguishing critics that they bring in the salvo at the at the close of the above paragraph respecting these popular virtues not interfering with the general principles of benevolence which christianity inculcates  this is the very point in question and however successfully the advocates for christianity may have combated shaftsbury and others there is some room still left for opposing our authors argument  valor says he for instance or active courage is for the most part constitutional and therefore can have no more claim to moral merit than wit beauty health strength or any other endowment of the mind or body and so far is it from producing any salutary effects by introducing peace order or happiness into society that it is the usual perpetrator of all the violences which from retaliated injuries distract the world with bloodshed and devastation it is the engine by which the strong are enabled to plunder the weak the proud to trample upon the humble and the guilty to oppress the innocent it is the chief instrument which ambition employs in her unjust pursuits of wealth and power and is therefore so much extolled by her votaries it was indeed congenial with the religion of pagans whose gods were for the most part made out of deceased heroes exalted to heaven as a reward for the mischiefs which they had perpetrated upon earth and therefore with them this was the first of virtues and had even engrossed that denomination to itself but whatever merit it may have assumed among pagans with christians it can pretend to none  there would be some argument in all this if because valor be the occasional instrument of oppression it be also the necessary cause of it or if men were always mischievous in proportion as they are bold but we presume that this is not the case cruelty being characteristic of cowardice and benevolence of bravery personal valor may therefore be justly esteemed to have some moral merit although as it is allowed to be in a great degree constitutional it is certainly no farther to be deemed a moral virtue than it is to be personally acquired for a virtue notwithstanding the plausibility of our authors reasoning we presume it may justly be styled  our author indeed says that few or none are the occasions in which christians are permitted to exert their courage or valor they are so far says he from being allowed to inflict evil that they are forbid even to resist it they are so far from being encouraged to revenge injuries that one of their first duties is to forgive them so far from being incited to destroy their enemies that they are commanded to love them and to serve them to the utmost of their power  surely our author here mistakes the nature of that evil which christians are forbid to resist it certainly is not the moral evil of injustice admitting they are not to revenge injuries surely they may exert their valor to prevent the execution of them if not a good christian must not resist the violence of a robber a housebreaker or a murderer  but granting that individuals anxious to copy after christian perfection are justified in thus submitting to though it be in fact conniving at the commission of acts of injustice valor may be yet a necessary virtue to the support and defense of christian communities as we shail show when we come to treat of patriotism  but though our author will not admit active courage to be a real virtue passive courage or fortitude he allows to be consistent with the purest christian morality  passive courage says he is frequently and properly inculcated by this meek and suffering religion under the titles of patience and resignation a real and substantial virtue this and a direct contrast to the former for passive courage arises from the noblest dispositions of the human mind from a contempt of misfortunes pain and death and a confidence in the protection of the atmighty active from the meanest from passion vanity and selfdependence passive courage is derived from a zeal for truth and a perseveranee in duty active is the offspring of pride and revenge and the parent of cruelty and injustice in short passive courage is the resolutiot of a philosopher active the ferocity of a savage nor is this more incompatible with the precepts than with the object of this religion which is the attainment of the kingdom of heaven for valor is not that sort of violence by which that kingdom is to be taken nor are the turbulent spirits of heroes and conquerors admissibleinto those regions of peace subordination and tranquillity  this is on the whole well said though we cannot agree that valor or active courage is always the offspring of pride and revenge or the parent of cruelty and injustice  passivecourage may also be justly styled the resolution of a philosopher and yet active courage be very unjustly called the ferocity of a savage not but that the activity of some men is fierce and ferocious as the passiveness of others is tame and irresolute  on patriotism our author declaims thus  patriotism that celebrated virtue so much practiced in ancient and so much professed in modern times that virtue which so long preserved the liberties of greece and exalted rome to the empire of the world this celebrated virtue i say must also be excluded because it not only falls short of but directly counteracts the extensive benevolence of this religion a christian is of no country he is a citizen of the world and his neighbors and countrymen are the inhabitants of the remotest regions whenever their distresses demand his friendly assistance christianity commands us to love all mankind patriotism to oppress all other countries to advance the imaginary prosperity of our own christianity enjoins to imitate the universal benevolence of our creator who pours forth his blessings on every nation upon earth patriotism to copy the mean partiality of an english parishofficer who thinks injustice and cruelty meritorious whenever they promote the interests of his own inconsiderable village this has ever been a favorite virtue with mankind because it conceals selfinterest under the mask of public spirit not only from others but even from them selves and gives a license to inflict wrongs and injuries mot only with impunity but with applause but it is so diametrically opposite to the great characteristic of this institution that it never could have been admitted into the list of christian virtues  without recurring to what other writers may have advanced in favor of the christianity of patriotism we shall offer a few reasons that suggest themselves to us to show that the love of ones self and ones country is not so inconsistent with that universal philanthropy inculcated by christianity as this writer here supposes  true selflove and social fays the poet are one and the same  selflove but serves the virtuous mind to wake as the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake still from the central point the circle spreads and wider grows as still the next succeeds thus father brother friend we first embrace our country next next all the human race rousseau somewhere observes that the universal philanthropy of those cosmopolites who have neither love for their relations friendship for their neighbors nor partiality for their country is justly to be suspected even as he who has no love for himself can hardly be supposed to love all mankind and yet rousseau was a warm advocate for the purity of the christian morality  what philosophy there is in this poetry will appear in the course of our argument  to the judicious omission of these false virtues valor patriotism and friendship our author says we may add that remarkable silence which the christian legislator every where preserves on subjects esteemed by all others of the highest impotance civil government rational policy and the rights of war and peace of these he has not taken the least notice probably for this plain reason because it would have been impossible to have formed any explicit regulations concerning them which must not have been inconsistent with the purity of his religion or with the practical observance of such imperfect creatures as men ruling over and contending with each other for instance had he absolutely forbid all resistance to the reigning powers he had constituted a plan of despotism and made men slaves had he allowed it he must have authorized disobedience and made them rebels had he in direct terms prohibited all war he must have left his followers for ever an easy prey to every infidel invader had he permitted it he must have licensed all that rapine and murder with which it is unavoidably attended  now not to dwell on the impropriety in the last sentence of charging the power permitting war with the licensing of all the rapine and murder attending it we object to the matter of fact as stated in the whole passage  without insisting with the monthly reviewers that the character of our savior was conspicuously illustrious as a patriot we may safely deny that he has not taken the least notice of matters of patriotism and civil polity as our author asserts his reply to the pharisees who tempted him on the subject of paying tribute  give unto caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are of god  is an irrefragable instance of the distinction he made between religion and politics  civil government national policy and the rights of war and peace were subjects indeed that appear not to have come directly under his decision had they so done we have no reason to think our savior lay under any kind of impossibility to give a very explicit and satisfactory answer  if he was not explicit however in precept respecting the authority of civil government it must be admitted he was illustriously so in example by his submission to the forms of justiciary trial and juridical condemnation which surely were not necessary to his death if no such example was intended to be given or precept thence to be inculcated  but had our savior himself given neither precept nor example on this head his inspired apostles peter and paul have more than sufficiently done it by enjoining their disciples to the most unreserved obedience to the municipal laws and civil magistracy of their times and thence instructing christians in general to a similar obedience to the reigning powers that be in all times  in this however they have made men no farther slaves in this world than they are christians whose faith is fixed and whose hopes are centered in another so far as they are still men and bound to take part in the concerns of this world while on their journey to the next they are at liberty to resist oppression and combat injustice whether that of a domestic tyrant or a foreign invader  had my kingdom says our savior to pilate been of this world then would my servants have fought that i should not be delivered to the jews  granting that christians therefore are not to propagate their religion by force of arms or to fight for christs kingdom which is not of this world they are not forbidden to fight for their own share in the kingdoms which are of this world  if men may not fight for their religion they may fight for their liberty and property and in our opinion they act the part of brave men and good christians in so doing  and yet our author says if christian nations were nations of christians all war would be impossible and unknown among them and valor could be neither of use or estimation and therefore could never have a place in the catalogue of christian virtues being irreconcilable with all its precepts  of a piece with this reasoning of our authors is that of rousseau in his social compact where he insinuates that a christian soldier is a kind of a contradiction in terms but we have here given our reasons for thinking otherwise from which it follows that even active valor appears to be a real and not a fictitious virtue  for if a good christian be a good patriot he must be ready to act as well as suffer for his country he must at least be ready to fight if necessary in its defense and valor is as requisite to repel an invader as it is to invade the foe there is as much active courage required in defense as in offense and hence as loyalty and patriotism are the virtues of a good subject valor must have some merit even with christians as a moral virtue at least active courage must be as much a moral virtue as passive they are insfact equally constitutional as above hinted and it is presumed are not badly illustrated by the following poetical allusion the fountain is thy favorite theme that trickles forth a shallow stream in murmurs soft a purling rill  what will thou do to work thy mill how will thou make to ride at large thy timber or thy loaded barge  as much as purling rills admired the navigable streams required the stream whose turbulence abides the roaring of the swelling tides alike whose raging bosom swells and back the threatening tide repels  hence to the valiant and the brave given half the world the rest to save ep to lor   but be that as it may our author certainly falls into an error in supposing it necessary for a good christian to renounce his country to become a citizen of the world a mere cosmopolite  in regard to the virtue of friendship our author either wilfully or negligently imposes a change of terms upon us reasoning very inaccurately on the subject   friendship says he likewise although more congenial to the principles of christianity arising from more tender and amiable dispositions could never gain admittance amongst her benevolent precepts for the same reason because it is too narrow and confined and appropriates that benevolence to a single object which is here commanded to be extended over all where friendships arise from similarity of sentiments and disinterested affections they are advantageous agreeable and innocent but have little pretensions to merit for it is justly observed if ye love them which love you what thanks have ye for sinners love those that love them but if they are formed from alliances in parties factions and interests or from a participation of vices the usual parents of what are called friendships among mankind they are then both mischievous and criminal and consequently forbidden but in their utmost purity deserve no recommendation from this religion  in reply however to what is here advanced on friendship and the text quoted from luke in support of it may be opposed the precept inculcated in john xiii    quoted also by our author in favor of that christian virtue charity a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another  here we see that brotherlylove or mutual friendship which in the former text is represented as of little merit being the virtue of sinners is made the test or criterion of christianity the virtue one should imaging characteristic of saints  christian charity in its utmost extent is certainly something more than mere friendship but we cannot help thinking that reciprocal affection or as our author styles it that benevolent disposition which is here made the characteristic of christs disciples the test of their obedience and the mark by which they are to be distinguished is too near akin to friendship to admit of friendships being with propriety discarded as a fictitious virtue or as no virtue at all  our author indeed is far from reasoning accurately on this head for after depreciating as above the virtue specified he tells us he means not by this to pass any censure on the principles of valor patriotism and honor  the attentive reader will here observe that in this respecification of the spurious or false virtues our author has substituted the term honor instead of friendship the reason is that having changed his ground he found that more pertinent to the state of his argument of that phantom modern honor indeed to which the most solid and substantial friendships are sometimes sacrificed he may say justly that a man who makes this his ruling principle however virtuous he may be cannot be a christian because he erects a standard of duty and deliberally adheres to it diametrically opposite to the whole tenor of that religion  that the laws of such honor are incompatible with the rules of christianity we readily allow though we cannot allow that the sirmest friendship for an individual is incompatible with that universal philanthropy which christianity inculcates for all mankind nay we do not hold patriotism or even valor to be such mere heathenish virtues as our author would represent them  they may be useful sayshe and perhaps necessary in the commerce and business of the present turbulent and imperfect state and those who are actuated by them may be virtuous honest and even religious men all that i assert is that they cannot be christians  and yet in a subsequent page of the work we are expressly told that in the present state as enlightened by the gospel if we will not accept of christianity we can have no religion at all surely this is inconsistent ay and no too can never be good divinity   after degrading the false virtues of paganism he proceeds to enhance the true virtues of christianity these are poverty of spirit  christian charity  penitence  faith  selfabasement and detachment from the world   admitting all that is said in favor of most of these as being founded on scriptural authority the virtue of faith that which is the most immediately connected with the evidence of the divine origin of christianity demands our more particular attention  faith says our author is another moral duty injoined by this institution of a species so new that the philosophers of antiquity had no words expressive of this idea nor nor any such idea to be expressed for the word  or fides which we translate faith was never used by any pagan writer in a sense the least similar to that to which it is applied in the new testament where in general it signifies an humble teachable and candid disposition a trust in god and confidence in his promises when applied particularly to christianity it means no more than a belief of this single proposition that christ was the son of god that is in the language of those writings the messiah who was foretold by the prophets and expected by the jews who was sent by god into the world to preach righteousness judgment and everlasting life and to die as an atonement for the sins of mankind this was all that christ required to be believed by those who were willing to become his disciples he who does not believe this is not a christian and he who does believes the whole that is essential to his profession and all that is properly comprehended under the name of faith  we see here that though our author scrupled at first setting out to say what pure christianity was he has reduced it in this illustration of faith to what he calls a single proposition but he cannot be ignorant that this single proposition is sufficiently multifarious and complicated  he cannot be ignorant that the expression son of god is differently understood by different interpreters that some think it consistent with his being a mere man while others think it exalts him to an equality with the deity  he cannot be ignorant that his atonement by death for the sins of mankind is controverted and even boldly denied by a considerable number of professed christians  to what purpose is it that our author tells us this proposition is the essential creed of a christian if other writers of equal authority tell us otherwise nay to what purpose is it we are told that the same proposition is to be found in the scriptures whose truth we admit if they are liable to various interpretation  it is in vain to say that when we are once convinced the scriptures are of divine original we have nothing more to do but implicitly believe what they tell us how many thousand volumes of controversy have there not been written to determine what they do tell us and is it not still left as indeterminate as ever  granting that implicit faith in divine revelation be our duty by what means are we to trace from the history of that revelation what is really revealed surely it must be by the same means as those by which we become convinced of its divine original and if reason be competent in the one case it surely must be so in the other  at the same time if the operation of grace be necessary to impress the true sense and meaning of the scriptures on the mind and heart of the unconverted sinner why should it be less necessary as it is evidently equally expedient to convince him of the divine origin of revelation in general  we firmly believe that admitting the reality of our authors conversion to christianity of which we have no reason to doubt he is much more indebted for it to the efficacious and irresistible impulse of divine grace than to all the pains he has taken and the ingenuity he has exerted in investigating the moral proofs of its divine institution  but we shall in this section confine ourselves in conformity to the authors method to the consideration of faith merely as a christian duty the objects of that faith with the nature of it we shall discuss more particularly hereafter  faith says he cannot be altogether void of moral merit as some would represent it because it is in a degree voluntary for daily experience shows us that men not only pretend to but actually do believe and disbelieve almost any propositions which best suits their interests or inclinations and unfeignedly change their sincere opinions with their situations and circumstances for we have power over the minds eye as well as over the bodys to shut it against the strongest rays of truth and religion whenever they become painful to us and to open it again to the faint glimmerings of skepticism and infidelity when we love darkness rather than light because our deeds are evil and this i think sufficiently refutes all objections to the moral nature of faith drawn from the supposition or its being quite involuntary and necessarily dependent on the degree of evidence which is offered to our understandings  we cannot pretend to call in question the ductility of our authors believing organs or the power he has over them to enable him to believe what he pleases but we must own with regard to ourselves we should be happy to be possessed of such power of credulity so as to be able to believe every thing to be true which best suits our interests inclinations and circumstances even though we should thence be subject to be sometimes disagreeably undeceived we should get rid of many irksome reflections and enjoy many a happy hour at the hazard only of being disturbed from our pleasing reveries and exclaiming with the interrupted visionary pol me occidistis amici non servastis ait cui sic extorta voluptas et demtus per vim mentis gratissimus error  as it is we do not perceive ourselves especially just at present a whit more disposed to believe than to doubt the reality of what we wish to be true we do not think the observation holds good at least so generally or in the degree here supposed the bold and sanguine indeed are apt to anticipate their wishes but the timid and saturnine are as apt to procrastinate even their just expectations it is as natural for the one to be confident as for the other to be dubious nay persons of the same constitution are not always in the same disposition or mood either of doubt or credulity  that there is some truth however in the rule with respect to its general application is probable as faith or facility of belief is frequently and strongly recommended in the gospel  but by the faith or easiness of belief inculcated in the gospel can surely be meant nothing more than the pious assent and submissive acquiescence of human reason to its mysterious and incomprehensible doctrines agreeable to its gospel signification mentioned above meaning an humble tractable and candid disposition a trust in god and confidence in his promises see page     and not that rational conviction which arises from a clear comprehension of a proposition and the evident demonstration of its truth the futility of recommending the latter kind of faith or facility of rational conviction we think is obvious  indeed we do not see the necessity of demonstration to produce such an assent as is here admitted to constitute a christians faith if such faith be as our author says an act of the will as much as of the understanding there are many inducements to such an act that fall far short of demonstration  if it be as he observes well worth every mans while to believe christianity if he can and such belief depends so much on his will one would think motives of selfinterest alone would excite him to show that he could in this case do as he would  is it not a sufficient incitement to faith in christianity to ressect that it is the surest preservative against vicious habits and their attendant evils the best resource under distresses and disappointments ill health and ill fortune and the firmest basis on which contemplation can rest  that it is the only principle which can retain men in a steady and uniform course of virtue piety and devotion or can support them in the hour of distress of sickness and of death   the word faith indeed our author calls unfortunate it has says he been so tortured and so misapplied to mean every absurdity which artifice could impose upon ignorance that it has lost all pretensions to the title of virtue but if brought back to the simplicity of its original signification it well deserves that name because it usually arises from the most amiable dispositions and is always a direct contrast to pride obstinacy and selfconceit if taken in the extensive sense of an assent to the evidence of things not seen it comprehends the existence of a god and a future state and is therefore not only itself a moral virtue but the source from whence all others must proceed for on the belief of these all religion and morality must entirely depend  here again we must remind this writer of his having before admitted that men might be virtuous honest and even religious men and yet not be christians whereas now he makes not only all religion but all morality depend on christian faith for its very existence such faith being here expressly declared not only in itself a moral virtue but the source from whence all others must proceed  wits they say have short memories but when they turn logicians philosophers and divines they should endeavor to extend their memory and keep it on the stretch with the thread of their argument from one end to the other  on the whole with respect to faith as a moral duty there appears to us but very little argument necessary to enforce it if men can believe or even halfbelieve what they will it is so much their interest to do it in believing the truths of christianity the man must be either a very great fool or a very great philosopher indeed who would remain one moment an infidel  if as this writer declares faith be also the source from whence all other real virtues must proceed who would not be a christian in practice as well as theory without waiting a moment for any rational proof of the internal evidence of christianity  sect v on the fourth or conclusive proposition that such a system of religion and morality could not possibly have been the work of any man or set of men much less of those obscure and illiterate persons who actually did discover and publish it to the world and that therefore it must undoubtedly have been effected by the interposition of divine power that is it must derive its origin from god  this proposition shown to contain only corollaries of the preceding propositions and though true as to fact and therefore admitted ex gratia still problematical in argument  this proposition or rather two propositions united our author gives as corollaries to the three preceding presuming they are so conclusive as to amount to little short of demonstration it is indeed founded says he on the very same reasoning by which the material world is proved to be the work of his invisible hand we view with admiration the heavens and the earth and all therein contained we contemplate with amazement meant the minute bodies of animals too small for preception and the immense planetary orbs too vast for imagination we are certain that these cannot be the works of man and therefore we conclude with reason that they must be the productions of an omnipotent creator  in the same manner we see here a scheme of religion and morality unlike and superior to all ideas of the human mind equally impossible to have been discovered by the knowledge as invented by the artifice of man and therefore by the very same mode of reasoning and with the same justice we conclude that it must derive its origin from the same omnipotent and omniscient being  with due deference to this ingenious writer this like many other parts of his work is rather declamatory than argumentative in contemplating the works of creation our wonder is excited and our admiration raised in proportion as human genius is enabled to trace the marks of divine wisdom in the great artificer  the vulgar indeed may gape and stare at what they cannot comprehend but how limited are their ideas how low are their conceptions of the power and wisdom of the deity their wonder at the most stupendous instances of both is like that of a child at the squeaking of a trumpet or the tinkling of a rattle  the admiration of the ignorant indeed is founded on their ignorance that of the scientific on their knowledge it is not from what we do not comprehend that we deduce the wisdom and power of the creator but from what we do comprehend which however comparatively little is the real foundation of our faith in his omniscience and omnipotence  on the other hand it is according to this writer from the incomprehensibility of the scriptures as well as of the works of nature that their divine origin is to be deduced  the manner of reasoning therefore is not as this writer asserts the same in both cases but totally different in reasoning from our view of the material world we prudently reason from what we know and how shall we reason otherwise what can we reason but from what we know and yet in logicising according to our authors mode from a view both of the material world and of revelation we foolishly attempt to reason from what we do not know  thus he says of the former it is not in the least surprising that we are not able to understand the spiritual dispensations of the almighty when his material works are to us no less incomprehensible our reason can afford us no insight into those great properties of matter gravitation attraction elasticity and electricity nor even into the essence of matter itself can reason teach us how the suns luminous orb can fill a circle whose diameter contains many millions of miles with a constant inundation of successive rays during thousands of years without any perceivable diminution of that body from whence they are continually poured or any augmentation of those bodies on which they fall and by which they are constantly absorbed can reason tell us how those rays darted with a velocity city greater than that of a canon ball can strike the tenderest organs of the human frame without inflicting any degree of pain or by what means this percussion only can convey the forms of distant objects to an immaterial mind or how any union can be formed between material and immaterial essences or how the wounds of the body can give pain to the soul or the anxiety of the soul can emaciate and destroy the body that all these things are so we have visible and indisputable demonstration but how they can be so is to us as incomprehensible as the most abstruse mysteries of revelation can possibly be  but so far are we from having any visible and indisputable demonstration of the union or even existence of two essentially different and distinct substances in body and soul that our ablest philosophers deny the possibility of such demonstration see dr priestleys introduction to hartleys essays on man   and indeed if our author did not himself confess it we should hardly be made to believe that he is himself so bad a philosopher as to take the evidence of sense than which nothing is niore fallible for demonstration  it is with propriety indeed he asks if reason can explain the popular system of the solar rays in exhibiting the emanation of light because that popular system is unphilosophical unreasonable and merely imaginary were he acquainted with the real mechanism productive of those phenomena he might be struck with the amazing display of wisdom and power in the divine mechanism but he would find no greater mystery tery in it than in the complicated operation of the most simple mechanic powers  we do readily agree with this ingenious investigator that we see but a small part of the great whole that we know but little of the relation which the present life bears to preexistent and future states that we can conceive little of the nature of god and his attributes or mode of existence that we can comprehend little of the material and still lest of the moral plan on which the universe is constituted or on what principle it proceeds  but we cannot admit ourselves to be quite so ignorant of the mechanism of the material universe or the true principles of natural philosophy as our author appears to be  and though with regard to the theological plan of the universe we should confess our greater ignorance and incapacity of comprehension we should not presume as our author in fact does to deduce the internal evidence of its divine origin from that very incapacity  on the contrary we think even the best experience and historical information respecting both the works of nature and the doctrines of revelation equally insufficient to form such a conclusion whether from natures general law the outlines of our creed we draw or think the truth be only given in revelation pure from heaven it matters not unless we find some active index in the mind some ray of grace a purer light to point or here or there aright ep to lor    another argument adduced by this author respects the propagation of this religion which he says is not less extraordinary than the religion itself or less above the reach of all human power than the discovery of it was above that of all human understanding  it is well known says he that in the course of a very few years it was spread over all the principal parts of asia and of europe and this by the minlstry only of an inconsiderable number of the most inconsiderable persons that at this time paganism was in the highest repute believed universally by the vulgar and patronized by the great that the wisest men of the wisest nations assisted at its sacrifices and consulted its oracles on the most important occasions whether these were the tricks of the priests or of the devil is of no consequence as they were both equally ulikely to be converted or overcome the fact is certain that on the preach ing of a few fishermen their altars were deserted and their deities were dumb  out of veneration for the subject we shall not place this argument in that ridiculous light into which it might be thrown at the same time having intimated in what a suspicious light we hold historical evidence in general we shall not enter into any dispute about matters of fact the clergy are much obliged to the writer for putting their power on a par and of course making them what they ought to be a match for the devil   we might otherwise controvert the reputable state of paganism at the commencement of the christian era the immediate dumbfounding of its oracles by the preaching of the fishermen and the consequent establishment of christianity in the principal parts of europe and asia atleast if its doctrine obtained a hearing and for a while a very partial reception they were soon obscured and obliterated while religion and philosophy were consigned to oblivion together when minerva could no longer protect her city it was forsaken by good fortune and would have lingered in decay but the barbarians interposed and suddenly completed its downfall athens itself was pillaged by goths and its libraries consumed devastation reigned within and solitude without its walls a situation in which according to dr chandler it remains to this day notwithstanding the successive efforts of christian emperors and pontiffs by croisades and holy wars to effect its establishment   the belief of the vulgar in any age reflects but little credit on their religion and as to the wisest men of the wisest nations of paganism consulting the oracle on important occasions we can no more infer their really interesting themselves in behalf of paganism than we can infer a similar conclusion in favor of christianity from the similar farce which the wisest men of the wisest nations in europe play now  even in this protestant country do not our patricians senators and magistrates goin procession to church and pay their formal devoirs on certain red letter days though they laugh at the institution and even execrate the occasion  in polished popish countries their religious ceremonies are still as much more pompous and solemn as the occasion or design is still more held in contempt and derision even by the very persons assisting in their celebration that sensible and discerning traveller mrs miller remarked in particular the arch sneer of the roman pontiff while he performed the ceremony of serving at table and washing the feet of the poor priests in the sarce of the holy week   the fact is paganism was just in the same reputable state in greece and rome at that time as christianity is in paris and rome at this day so that if political circumstances did not interfere and christianity had no better support than the patronage of the great and the piety of the populace it might without a miracle be preached out of both cities by a methodist or a mountebank in much less time than paganism was formerly preached out of rome and athens by a few fishermen our author allows that neither learning nor sagacity is now able precisely to ascertain circumstances equally interesting of still later times we wonder therefore he should rest on this circumstance alone the divine authority of the fishermens commission it is equally surprising that having so many arguments and all of them according to him separately irrefragable he should think it necessary to accumulate others merely plausible  of this kind is that paradoxical insinuation that the improbabilities on the other side of the question are so much greater that an infidel must be an unbeliever from mere credulity see view page  0    of the same kind is that trite insinuating beggarly plea as lord shaftsbury calls it of what harm could ensue if christianity should after all prove a fable  there may be in some cases great virtue in that if but to us it appears very extraordinary that ever such a supposition should come from a writer who has labored so hard and adduced so many arguments to prove its impossibility  suppose quotha   surely after all he does not think there is still left a loop to hang a doubt on that he is so very anxious to persuade those he may not convince that he dwells so earnestly on the saving pleas of their being nothing to be lost and so much to be got by believing in christianity see view page iii be this as it may the whole argumentative part of the authors propositions and inference may be reduced to this the christian system would never have entered into the heads of any persons whatever it is inconceivable therefore how such men as did could propagate it  ergo it must have been conceived and propagated by the immediate and miraculous interposition of the deity   such is in sum and substance the whole of this mighty argument in the exposition of which we have possibly bestowed already much more time and pains than the discerning reader will think necessary  but having proceeded so far with our authors view we shall now proceed till we have shown the vanishing point of his perspective   sect vi on the writers general conclusions and his notions concerning the essential objects of the christian faith  till these objects are precisely determined the determination of the question respecting their divine origin of little importance  admitting even this writers propositions to have been demonstrated and the internal evidence of the divine origin of the christian religion fully proved we yet still recur to the question what is the christian religion or what are its doctrines  we have already observed that even the actual professors of christianity are by no means agreed on this head see page    our author himself indeed complains plains that some there are who by perverting the established signification of words which they call explaining have ventured to expunge all the principal doctrines out of the scriptures for no other reason than that they are not able to comprehend them and argue thus  the scriptures are the word of god in his word no propositions contradictory to reason can have a place these propositions are contradictory to reason and therefore they are not there but if these bold assertors would claim any regard they should reverse their argument and say  these doctrines make a part and a material part of the scriptures they are contradictory to reason no propositions contradictory to reason can be a part of the word of god and therefore neither the scriptures nor the pretended revelation contained in them can be derived from him this would be an argument worthy of rational and candid deists and demand a respectful attention but when men pretend to disprove facts by reasoning they have no right to expect an answer  our author will therefore hardly think it worth his while to answer the questions put to him on this head by certain reviewers who demand to know where or by what passages the new testament inculcates the doctrines he specifies doctrines which the rational advocates of christianity they pretend are afraid to adopt these advocates say they cannot adopt notions and sentiments which are founded on ambiguous sigurative or sacrificial expressions and suspect a misinterpretation of scripture where the doctrine they embrace is far removed from every tract of the human imagination  this is exactly what our author upbraids them for their wanting to reduce the extent of divine wisdom to the line of the human understanding  at the same time before we can admit our author to have deduced any conclusive argument respecting the internal evidence of the christian religion it is requisite he should certify what its doctrines are the critics lastmentioned suspect a misinterpretation of scripture where the doctrine they inculcate is far removed from every tract of the human imagination  the monthly reviewers say also it has not occurred to them that doctrines allowed to be contradictory to reason are not on this account the less credible  on the other hand our author makes their inconsistency with reason and their being above the flight of human imagination the very criterion of their divine origin and of course their credibility the scriptures according to him contain ideas totally unheard of and quite dissimilar from any which had ever been thought on previous to their publication no other says he ever drew so just a portrait of the worthlessness of this world and all its pursuits nor exhibited such distinct lively and exquisite pictures of the joys of another of the resurrection of the dead the last judgment and the triumphs of the righteous in that tremendous day when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality no other has ever represented the supreme being in the character of three persons united in one god no other has attempted to reconcile those seeming contradictory but both true propositions the contingency of future events and the foreknowledge of god or the free will of the creature with the overruling grace of the creator no other has so fully declared the necessity of wickedness and punishment yet so effectually instructed individuals to resist the one and to escape the other no other has ever pretended to give any account of the depravity of man or to point out any remedy for it no other has ventured to declare the unpardonable nature of sin without the influence of a mediatorial interposition and a vicarious atonement from the sufferings of a superior being  such are the objects of the christian religion according to this author but it is well known that the most essential of these doctrines are either totally disbelieved or explained away by a very considerable part of the professors of christianity  the very reviewers above mentioned in particular cannot allow with this writer that the province of reason is only to examine into the authority of revelation and when that is proved that reason has nothing more to do than to acquiesce  and so far we agree with them that reason is just as well qualified to judge of the interpretation of particular texts and passages of scripture as to judge of the authenticity of the whole  but we deny on the authority of that very scripture that unenlightened reason is qualified to judge of either our author readily as unnecessarily acknowledges as before observed that the scriptures are not revelations from god but the history of such revelations of whose imperfections and fallibility therefore we say nothing less than the influence of that divine grace which inspired the revelation itself can qualify any man to judge  hence the moral arguments and historical evidence which our author adduces to prove the divine origin of revelation appear nugatory  to deny the probable facts he says related in the new testament would be as absurd as to deny the probable facts in any other history  this is true and yet the joint evidence of all the probable facts related in any history sacred or profane amounts to no more than that moral evidence which will justify the belief of probable not improbable facts  the same may be said of the doctrines of the scriptures if their divine authority is to depend on mere historical evidence they should appear to be as rational as the evidence on which that authority is supported is probable and not the credibility of both facts and doctrines left preposterously to be supported according to our authors scheme by the improbability of the one and incomprehensibility of the other see page ii indeed the suggestion that any thing should be credible in proportion to its being incomprehensible is in itself a proof how far the human genius can soar into the mysterious and sublime why therefore suppose it so incapable of inventing mysterious and sublime religious systems genius lorenzo yours or mine faint image of a power divine endowed with even creative power to form the beings of an hour to people worlds to light the skies to bid a new creation rise over all to wield the thunderers rod and act the momentary god ep to lor   to ascertain the true system and genuine doctrines of this religion after the undecided controversies of above seventeen centuries and to remove all the rubbish which artifice and ignorance have been heaping upon it during all that time would indeed be an arduous talk which our author will by no means undertake nor is it indeed necessary when he can reduce all the essentials as he supposes into so small a compass  but it is necessary that these essentials should be agreed on and rendered indisputable before the proof of their divine origin can be of any use  with respect for instance to one of the most essential  that christ suffered and died as an atonement for the sins of mankind is a doctrine says the writer so constantly and so strongly enforced through every part of the new testament that whoever will seriously peruse those writings and deny that it is there may with as much reason and truth after reading the works of thucydides and livy assert that in them no mention is made of any facts relative to the histories of greece and rome  we are perfectly of his opinion in this respect and yet it is with astonishing confidence the contrary is maintained by many late writers of pretended candor and undoubted abilities so that while the doctrines of christianity are thus in dispute that is till it be determined what the essential doctrines of revelation are we conceive as we said before the determination of the question respecting its divine origin to be of very little importance even if it were determinable by our authors mode of argument but again we say we can by no means agree with him that men would believe divine revelation in proportion as its tenets were incomprehensible to the understanding  on the contrary the inference we should naturally draw from the imperfect state of human science and the insufficiency of unassisted reason to attain any portion of divine knowledge would be that nothing but the immediate influence of grace the inspiration of the almighty which gives understanding could induce the skeptic to believe either the divine origin of the scriptures or the doctrines they contain  sect vii on the objections that have been made to the divinity and veracity of the christian religion and particularly to objection the first viz that divine revelation is incredible because unnecessary because the reason which god has bestowed on mankind is sufficiently able to discover all the religious and moral duties which he requires of them if they will but attend to her precepts and be guided by her friendly admonitions  this objection shown to be neither properly stated nor satisfactorily removed  if says our author i have demonstrated the divine origin of the christian religion by an argument which cannot be confuted no others however plausible or numerous founded on probabilities doubts and conjectures can ever disprove it because if it is once shown to be true it cannot be false see view page to   there is no parrying these ifs but if this writers argument be not such as cannot be confuted there may besomething in the arguments founded on probabilities doubts and conjectures that make against it  it is on that supposition we imagine he attempts to refute such objections as it is on that conviction viz that his argument itself is invalid that we shall proceed to consider how far he has been successful in removing them  in answer to the first objection see view page      that revelation is incredible because unnecessary on the plea of the sufficiency of human reason to discover all the religious and moral duties god requires of them he observes that reason alone is so far from being sufficient to offer to mankind a perfect religion that it has never yet been able to lead them to any degree of culture or civilisation whatever deducing a demonstration as it seems to him from history that although human reason is capable of progression in science yet the first foundation must be laid by supernatural instructions see view p       now says he as reason in her natural state is incapable of making any progress does our author make a distinction between progress in knowledge and progression in science that human reason is admitted to be incapable of one and not of the other or does he mean by progression in science of which reason is incapable the starting ab initio which he confines to supernatural communication in either case there is an apparent contradiction in knowledge so when furnished with materials by supernatural aid if left to the guidance of her own wild imaginations she falls into more numerous and more gross errors than her own native ignorance could ever have suggested  only think reader of the wild imaginations of reason  and yet the reasonable suggestions which our author enumerates it must be owned are wild and extravagant enough  she says he that is reason has persuaded some that there is no god others that there can be no future state she has taught some that there is no difference between vice and virtue and that to cut a mans throat and to relieve his necessities are actions equally meritorious she has convinced many that they have no free will in opposition to their own experience some that there can be no such thing as soul or spirit contrary to their own perceptions and others no such thing as matter or body in contradiction to their senses by analyzing all things she can show that there is nothing in any thing by perpetual shifting she can reduce all existence to the invisible dust of skepticism and by recurring to first principles prove to the satisfaction of her followers that there are no principles at all  after this curious piece of sophistical declamation he adds how far such a guide is to be depended on in the important concerns of religion and morals i leave to the judgment of every considerate man to determine  that is after declaring reason to be a fallacious guide and an incompetent judge he will leave it to the direction of that very guide and the determination of that very judge how far such direction and determination are to be depended on  for what else can he mean by leaving it to the judgment of any considerate man is not this leaving it to reason or setting up reason in judgment on herself  to do justice to the noblest faculty of the human mind we will venture to declare that reason never suggested any of the above extravagancies to any man  reason never could persuade any man that there is no god indeed the office of reason is not persuasion but conviction and no man capable of conviction ever yet was even persuaded that second causes do not proceed from a first no atheist ever was known on earth till fiery zealots gave him birth for controversys sake their trade damning the heretic they made of the first cause or fools or wise the pure existence none denies though in its essence few agree for who defines infinity ep to lor   reason never taught any man there is no difference between virtue and vice his necessary use of the very terms is a proof of it as well as the natural sense of justice implanted in the breast of every humanbeing do unto others as you would have them do unto you is not merely new testament doctrine it is as old as the multiplication of mankind it is an universal principle a law of which to use the expression of a celebrated though inconsistent moralist every man may find the exposition in his own breast the rambler no     reason never taught any man there can be no future state the utmost that reason ever taught is that we are indebted to revelation for the certain knowledge of such state or must depend chiefly on scriptural proof for the evidence of it not but that there are even rational arguments in its favor as well of the physical and moral setting aside the moral and religious pleas usually adduced in proof of a future state the strong probability of it is plausibly urged in the eighth epistle to lorenzo on the simplest plea to animals of every kind are their peculiar powers assigned to actuate strengthen or restrain nor sense nor instinct given in vain man a mere animal confessed is yet distinguished from the rest his powers his views his labors here presumptive of a brighter sphere say why is knowledge given to raise our wonder to our makers praise why are we taught our god to adore if seen in death his face no more  it cannot be  of heavenly birth science descending to the earth to man has jacobs ladder given reaching an angels flight to heaven  as of the religious kind is it because we know not why so sad a thing for once to die is it so hazardous my friend on god our maker to depend that god to whom we being owe our friend and guardian here below who all along the vale of life in every scene of care and strife affords his providential arm to raise beneath or shield from harm is it for him so hard to save that conscious being from the grave  secure lorenzo in the power that waked me at my natal hour to me and mine in life so just on him in death i mean to trust safe in the hollow of his hand fearless to fall by whom i stand of whom i kiss the chastening rod and bless the father in the god ep to lor   reason never persuaded any man that he has no free will in opposition to his own experience  if she suggested a doubt of his capacity to will or act without a motive it is a suggestion founded on all experience as his conviction of not being a mere mechanical machine actuated by no motives at all is founded on the same experience  reason never suggested the nonexistence of soul or body of matter or spirit in contradiction to our senses and perceptions  neither matter nor spirit are ideas of sensation but of reflection reason teaches us indeed the fallibility of sensation and perception and the means of correcting their errors and well for us it is that she does so we should else be totally destitute of science and for want of the instincts of other animals should be in a worse situation than the brutes that perish  from the above specification indeed of the supposed absurdities of human reason it appears to us that our author has neither physics nor metaphysics enough to enter on a philosophical discussion of the points in question  we might therefore in like manner leave to the judgment of our considerate readers to determine whether the reason or rather the imagination of any man in his senses ever fell into grosser errors than has here that of our author in which case they would likewise determine how far such a guide is to be depended on in the important concerns of religion and morals  we might indeed censure here the superficial and illogical manner in which this writer has stated this objection viz his speaking of mankind as if the human mind was something distinct from and possessed of the power of controuling its essential faculties  but that excellent logician mr harris in his dialogue on happiness has illustrated in the most perspicuous manner the reciprocal influence of reason and passion in the conduct and composition of the human mind to such writers therefore we refer our author for the attainment of more precise ideas on this subject than he seems at present to possess or will ever obtain from the loose and rambling reasonings of those who style themselves christian philosophers or rational divines  sect viii on his reply to a second objection that the old and new testament cannot be a revelation from god because in them are to be found errors and inconsistencies fabulous stories false facts and false philosophy which can never be derived from the fountain of all truth  this objection shown to be rather enforced by the authors concessions than removed by his conclusions  here our author very readily and as we before observed in our opinion for his argument unnecessarily acknowledges that the scriptures are not revelations from god but only the history of them the revelation itself says he is derived from god but the history of it is the production of men and therefore the truth of it is not in the least affected by their fallibility see view page       he admits of course that the inspired writers were not always under the influence of inspiration for if they had says he st paul who was shipwrecked and left his cloak and parchments at troas would not have put to sea before a storm nor have forgot himself so much as to leave his cloak behind him  but continues he if in these books a religion superior to all human imagination actually exists it is of no consequence to the proof of its divine origin by what means it was there introduced or with what human errors and imperfections it is blended a diamond though found in a bed of mud is still a diamond nor can the dirt which surrounds it depreciate its value or destroy its luster  this allusion may be well calculated to catch the simple apprehension of the superficial reader but one of the least discrimination cannot fail to discover how totally inapplicable it is to the subject in question  a fine lady indeed may carelessly drop a manufactured brilliant into the kennel to be accidentally picked up by a goldfinder but rough diamonds are not originally found there they have not their native bed in the streets or on the dunghill but are dug from mines prepared by natures process for their production in which state also they do not shine with a luster so greatly superior to the surrounding materials  we by no means agree with our author therefore that his proof of the internal evidence of the divine origin of revelation does not suffer by admitting that the prophecies are all fortunate guesses or artful applications and the miracles there recorded no better than legendary tales see view page       on the contrary we conceive that such an heterogeneous mixture of truth and falsehood as he hypothetically admits in the history as he calls it of revelation would if it really existed there very reasonably bring the truths it contains into doubt  nay we will go so far as to admit that there really do appear so many errors and inconsistencies in that history that unenlightened reason cannot reconcile them the inspiration of grace being as necessary to point out these truths and induce a firm belief of them as it was to direct and enable the inspired writers to record them  sect ix on his reply to a third objection that a wise and benevolent creator should have constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another under the term religion in this objection the author is shown to include morals also but the purity of the christian morals is shown not to be calculated for the constitution of this world and therefore not required of christians in their present state of probation  to some speculative and refined observers it has appeared incredible says our author that a wise and benevolent creator should have constituted a world upon one plan and a religion for it on another that is that he should have revealed a religion to mankind which not only contradicts the principal passions and inclinations which he has implanted in their natures but is incompatible with the whole economy of that world which he has created and in which he has thought proper to place them this say they with regard to the christian is apparently the case the love of power riches honor and fame are the great incitements to generous and magnanimous actions yet by this institution are all these depreciated and discouraged government is essential to the nature of man and cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence corruption and imposition yet are all these strictly forbid nations cannot subsist without wars nor war be carried on without rapine desolation and murder yet are these prohibited under the severest threats the nonresistance of evil must subject individuals to continual oppressions and leave nations a defenseless prey to their enemies yet is this recommended perpetual patience under insults and injuries must every day provoke new insults and new injuries yet is this injoined a neglect of all we eat and drink and wear must put an end to all commerce manufactures and industry yet is this required in short were these precepts universally obeyed the disposition of all human affairs mustbe entirely changed and the business of the world constituted as it now is could not go on  the monthly reviewers very justly observe on this passage that no serious advocate for christianity can admit all these contradictions for indeed they militate not less against the practical principles of christianity than against those of commonsense our author nevertheless boldly affirms that such is the christian revelation though some of its advocates may perhaps be unwilling to own it and such it is constantly declared to be by him who gave it as well as by those who published it under his immediate direction to these he says if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hates you john xv     to the jews he declares ye are of this world i am not of this world john viii     st paul writes to the romans be not conformed to this world romans xii    and to the corinthians  we speak not the wisdom of this world cor ii    st james says know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god jam iv    this irreconcilable disagreement between christianity and the world is announced in numberless berless other places in the new testament and indeed by the whole tenor of those writings these are plain declarations which in spite of all the evasions of those good managers who choose to take a little of this world in their way to heaven stand fixed and immovable against all their arguments drawn from public benefit and pretended necessity and must ever forbid any reconciliation between the pursuits of this world and the christian institution  we have as much contempt as our author can have for those good managers who choose to take as much of this world as they can with them in their journey to the next we are also as well satisfied as he can be that christian morality in its purity is not calculated for the practice of man in his present state but inculcated to inspire a proper disposition preparatory to another but for the same reasons we think the observance of it no farther required of us than it is practicable  if it be possible as much as lies in you live peaceably with all men romans xii     says st paul to the romans the christian religion enjoins not impossibilities it imposes not hard and impracticable duties requiring no more of any man than lies in him the scripture expressly declares its yoke is easy and its burden is light but are selfmortification penance the loving ones enemies the renouncing ones property and even ones life are these easy or light  we believe that however they may have been required of particular persons on particular occasions the general imposition of such unnecessary commands have only served to disgust the welldisposed and sincere christian and to fill the world with hypocrites   the several texts therefore above adduced by our author are evidently misapplied  that a conformity to the vices and follies of the world is prohibited to christians is most certain but where are they forbid to conform to the established customs and necessary duties of society are they not on the other hand expressly enjoined to submit to every ordinance of man for the lords sake  to pay the most implicit obedience to magistrates and all that are in power for that the powers that be are of god  where is it we ask again that christians are required by the scriptures so to act as to put an end to all commerce manufactures and industry to change the disposition of all human affairs and put a stop to the business of the world   are these extravagances deduced from our saviors sermon on the mount and the instructions he gave his immediate disciples  men possessed of the power of working miracles for their support or defense might safely indeed leave tomorrow to take care for itself careless of what they might eat drink or wear but setting aside the consideration that many things may be enjoined as particular and personal duties adapted to time and place which are by no means required universally setting aside also the consideration that our savior was exhibiting to his disciples a theory of morality adapted rather to man in a state of perfection than to man in his present imperfect state of probation it is plain that he had in view the holding up a contrast to the boasted morality of those vainglorious hypocrites the scribes and pharisees in order to check that overweening pride with which they exulted in their goodworks over the sincere and humble penitence of the publican and sinner  our savior did not preach the same strictness of morals to all as he did to his immediate followers behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do to inherit eternal life  and he said unto him why call thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou will enter into life keep the commandments  he says unto him which jesus said thou shall do no murder thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself   every one of these commandments we see respects the discharge of the social duties incumbent on man in the present state of society not one is mentioned of a nature purely religious even the first commandment respecting the very acknowledgment of god is omitted and yet jesus says keep these commandments and thou will enter into life  the unattainable nature of moral goodness in this mortal state is also here strongly inculcated there is none good but god this passage has been urged in proof of our saviors giving up all pretensions to personal divinity but the contrary is plain on the slightest reflection this querist who seems to have possessed all the spirit of the pharisees came forsooth with his good master in opposition to those humble believers who saluted jesus by the title of lord to which they had no need to add the epithet of good  our savior who read the hearts of men and never wanted shrewdness of reply questioned him therefore why on the presumption he was addressing a mere man he called him good an epithet applicable only to god so far therefore is this passage from making against our saviors asserting his own divinity it proves that he did so in an instance where without any impeachment of his title he might have neglected it    and yet so good was the presuming querist that he answered he had kept all these commandments from his youth up pertly adding what lack i yet  jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go sell that thou have give it to the poor and follow me  this sacrifice of the things of this world we see was required of him not as the conditions of his salvation but as a proof of that moral perfection to which he pretended and as a qualification necessary for him to become an immediate follower and disciple of jesus christ  in like manner we will venture to say that christianity at this day requires no purer morals in its professors than as much as in them lies to live peaceably with all men to keep those commandments which are essential to the good of society and the peace and happiness of mankind  let the sincere christian do this and we believe he will enter into eternal life even though he should be somewhat nice in regard to what he eats drinks and wears though he should promote commerce manufactures and industry yea though he should consistently with the laws of his country resent insults punish injuries enter into the civil or even military service of government draw his sword against the enemies of the state and even fatally embrue it in blood to chastise the insolence of unnatural rebellion  sect x on his reply to a fourth objection that if this revelation had really been from god his infinite power and goodness could never have suffered it to have been so soon perverted from its original purity to have continued in a state of corruption through the course of so many ages and at last to have proved so ineffectual to the reformation of mankind  the manner in which this objection is attempted to be removed shown to reflect the highest indignity on the divine author of the christian religion as well as on that religion itself  in answer to this fourth objection our author very heartily and very simply replies that on examination all this will be found inevitable  we believe it things could not possibly be otherwise because such was the general design of providence and such the christian dispensation which was a part of it  in reply to this objection indeed our author admits the whole force of it which he endeavors to elude by a very simple expedient much such another as that by which he accounts elsewhere for the origin of evil necessity hard necessity which even the omnipotence of the deity could not prevent what is this but making the god of the christians a mere heathen jupiter subject to the control of superior fate  he admits that after christianity had had made its way by means of the preaching of the poor and mean in holes and caverns under the iron rod of persecution till it so far prevailed as to obtain the countenance and protection of princes when kings became its patrons and queens its nursing mothers he admits we say that it could no longer withstand the irresistible effects of the natural imperfection of man and the political evils of civil society at length the meek and humble professors of the gospel inslaved these princes and conquered these conquerors their patrons and erected for themselves such a stupendous fabric of wealth and power as the world had never seen they then propagated their religion by the same methods by which it had been persecuted nations were converted by fire and sword and the vanquished were baptized with daggers at their throats see view page       horrid abominations exclaims our author at the enormities of the poor pagans but what more horrid abominations could they be guilty of than these were any of those which our author says were practiced in the pagan world and vanished at the approach of christianity more horrid or more abominable and yet they were permitted it seems because they could not be prevented they proceeded we are told from a chain of causes and consequences which could not have been broken without changing the established course of things by a constant series of miracles or a total alteration of human nature see view page       what a pity that a business which had so promising a beginning should be so soon interrupted by such sinister and unforeseen accidents for surely they must have been unforeseen when the course of things was about to be established and human nature first constituted  to be serious this is a bungling excuse for a supposed blunder in the first outset of things unless we seriously adopt the reason our author deduces from revelation viz that it could not be otherwise because that all men should be exempted from sin and punishment is utterly repugnant to the universal system and that constitution of things which infinite wisdom has thought proper to adopt view page       this may be but we revere the eternal councils of the great author and disposer of all things too much to suppose he was ever under the predicament of adopting any measure or system of action that resulted originally from any thing but his own will  sect xi on his reply to the fifth objection the incredibility of some of its doctrines particularly those concerning the trinity and atonement for sin by the sufferings and death of christ the one contradicting all the principles of human reason and the other all our ideas of natural justice  this objection shown to be rather evaded than solved the author not having fairly and fully stated the difficulties it really contains  to these objections says our author i shall only say that no arguments founded on principles which we cannot comprehend can possibly disprove a proposition already proved on principles which we do understand and therefore that on this subject they ought not to be attended to but this is rather evading the difficulty than solving it indeed with regard to the doctrines of the trinity and vicarious atonement he bestows on them some little attention in respect to the former he observes that three beings should be one being is a proposition which certainly contradicts reason that is our reason but it does not thence follow that it cannot be true for there are many propositions which contradict our reason and yet are demonstrably true  that this is a proposition contradictory to reason we admit but we deny that it is either true or capable of demonstration there may be propositions contradictory to reason and yet not demonstrably false nay they may be such as however contradictory to reason we cannot help believing to be true but to be demonstrably so they must be perfectly and evidently consonant to reason for demonstration is nothing but the result of a complete process of rational argument  that propositions apparently false are demon strably true is almost too notorious to merit illustration instances occur every moment in which the inference of our illinformed and immediate apprehension is directly contradictory to that of a betterinformed and deliberate reflection  there are propositions also that require not only much deliberation but much instruction before our reason is qualified to pass any judgment concerning them this our author elsewhere admits see section xii though under the present head he proceeds to support his assertion by example offering an instance of the propositions which he says are contradictory to reason and yet demonstrably true one says he is the very first principle of all religion the being of a god for that any thing should exist without a cause or that any thing should be the cause of its own existence are propositions equally contradictory to our reason yet one of them must be true or nothing could ever have existed  the monthly reviewers very justly insinuate that here is a confusion of terms indeed our author here sadly exposes his want of logical precision  not to cavil at his calling god a thing his opposing the term being or existence instead of effect to the term cause is illogical in the highest degree  all created beings or things are confessedly the effects of one first cause but we conceive this is the first time so expert a logician ever made such a blunder as to put the first cause on a footing with second causes and assert as our author in fact does that no cause could ever have existed that was not the effect of some prior cause if he is not betrayed here into a slat denial of the existence of a god or first cause we know not what is such  our author palpably mistakes the permanent predicament of existence and duration for the transitory one of production and succession in the former the terms being and thing are used with propriety in the latter those of cause and effect with equal propriety but it is a solecism in ratiocination to confound one with the other for though in the order of nature the existence of one thing becomes the productive cause of another the god of nature the primary and efficient cause of all superier to the work of his hands some writers indeed and those of celebrity have imagined a scale of beings rising up from the meanest of gods creatures to the creator himself but we always regarded this as groundless and visionary thy pride lorenzo disbelieve let lock nor addison deceive for tho creations varied plan assigns degrees respecting man yet humbly know and learn to fear god is beyond this mortal sphere created beings tho his care does he with them cteation share oh no the system all his own god the creator stands alone at equal distance all his plan the mite the seraph and the man ep to lor is exempted from the laws of subordination which he has prescribed as the tegular succession of second causes and effects it is indeed in our conception a kind of metaphysical blasphemy to represent god as an effect which could not have existed without a cause even though it be sheltered uhder the metaphysical absurdity of supposing that effect the cause of itself  and yet our author proceeds with his examples in like manner the overruling grace of the creator and the free will of his creatures his certain foreknowledge of future events and the uncertain contingency of those events are to our apprehensions absolute contradictions to each other and yet the truth of every one of these is demonstrable from scripture reason and experience  here again our author confounds the absolute and eternal attributes of the creator with the relative and temporary properties of his creatures that these should be apparently contradictory is no wonder but that they are not as our author affirms absolute contradictions is known to every man of sense and scicnce that has bestowed sufficient attention on the subject to whom these seeming contradictions must be easily reconcilable the overruling grace of the creator is irresistible and positive the free will of his creatures resistible and comparative the agency of man compared with that of the deity is limited confined and servile on the other hand if compared with the agency of inferior animals plants etc it is liberal and free  the foreknowledge of the deity is absolute and indisputable as the succession of future events is with respect to him fixed and unalterable with respect to man indeed their contingency is as uncertain as is his want of foreknowledge or ignorance of their necessary succession  all nature is but art unknown to thee all chance direction which thou can not see but to recur to the authors remarks on the doctrine of the trinity it is with propriety he observes that the difficulties with respect to our belief in this doctrine arise from our imagining that the mode of existence of all beings must be similar to our own that is that they must all exist in space and time hence says he very justly proceeds our embarrassment on this subject we know that no two beings with whose mode of existence we are acquainted can exist in the same point of time in the same point of space and that therefore they cannot be one but how far beings whose mode of existence bears no relation to time and space may be united we cannot comprehend and therefore the possibility of such an union we cannot positively deny  this is philosophical and just but there is a wide difference between positively denying a doctrine and absolutely believing it  most certain however it is that the doctrine of the trinity as it is taught by some of the athanasians cannot possibly be believed by any human being by nonsense nor deceit misled the honest heart and sober head some meaning positive and plain a creed believed must needs contain a parrot else if none deceive her a sound and orthodox believer as much convined as ever was yet your athanasian paroquet ep to lor   our author reduces this formidable absurdity for such it is as some trinitarians represent it to a mere simple proposition as easy to be believed as that three equal angles or sides constitute one equilateral triangle but this is not the case in the exuberant and rattling eloquence of the famous dr jeremy tailor the mystery of the godhead is thus enigmatically displayed  see what was to be taught a trinity in the unity of the godhead  that is the christian arithmetic three are one and one are three so lucian in his philopatris or some other decides the christian doctrines see their philosophy ex nihilo nihil fit  no ex nihilo omnia all things are made of nothing and a mangod and a godman the same person finite and infinite born in time and yet from all eternity the son of god but yet born of a woman and she a maid but yet a mother resurrection of the dead reunion of soul and body this was part of the christian physics or their natural philosophy see a moral demonstration of the truth of the christian religion first printed in the year    0 lately reprinted for cadell page      with due deference to the authority of this eminent divine as well as to his late editor bishop hurd all this is merely declamatory it is also so far sophistical in that it is the christian theology and not either arithmetic or physics  the mathematics and natural philosophy of the christian and the heathen are the same nor is it any impeachment to the divinity of revelation that it has no place in the cyclopaedia or circle of human arts and sciences  the case is these writers do not make a proper distinction between a palpable contradiction in terms and an apparent contrariety in fact there is also a necessary distinction to be made between the belief of the truth of a proposition or the believing a proposition to be true and the belief of the proposition itself the former being consistent with an imperfect apprehension of its meaning and the other consistent only with a clear and precise comprehension as well of the predicate as of the subject  from these distinctions arises a third equally just and necessary between the faith of the christian and the belief of the philosopher but of these distinctions more fully hereafter see the following section   sect xii on his reply to the sixth objection that however true these doctrines may be yet it must be inconsistent with the justice and goodness of the creator to require from his creatures the belief of propositions which contradict or are above the reach of that reason which he has thought proper to bestow on them this objection answered by denying that genuine christianity requires any such belief  the nature of the christian faith investigated and its latitude defined christianity as it requires nothing impracticable to be performed so it requires nothing impossible to be believed  to this sixth objection our author answers genuine christianity requires no such belief  it has discovered to us many important truths with which we were before entirely unacquainted and amongst them are these that three beings are some way united in the divine essence and that god will accept of the sufferings of christ as an atonement for the sins of mankind these considered as declarations of facts only neither contradict or are above the reach of human reason the first is a proposition as plain as that three equilaral lines compose one triangle that any three lines might do properly disposed though not equal indeed this allusion is by no means adequate and but little pertinent  the other is as intelligible as that one man should discharge the debts of another in what manner this union is formed or why god accepts these vicarious punishments or to what purposes they may be subservient it informs us not because no information could enable us to comprehend these mysteries and therefore it does not require that we should know or believe any thing about them  how not any thing about them surely this is loosely and badly expressed as a declaration of fact merely it has been already observed that the orthodox doctrine of the trinity is not so simple and rational as here laid down but much more complex and paradoxical  as to the quomodo of the triunion and the reason why god accepts of a vicarious atonement for the sins of mankind these are certainly beyond rational investigation but christians are doubtless required to believe so much about them as that the facts are as possible as their declaration is true  again if no information can enable us to comprehend these mysteries it is not with very great propriety such important truths are said to be discovered by revelation the doctrines as mere declarations indeed may be said to be discovered as they were not divulged before but if those doctrines themselves still remain mysterious they would with more propriety be said to be simply declared or promulgated than their truth to be discovered  the truth of these doctrines our author owns must rest entirely on the authority of those who taught them but then says he we should reflect that those were the same persons who taught us a system of religion more sublime and of ethics more perfect than any which our faculties were ever able to discover but which when discovered are exactly consonant to our reason and that therefore we should not hastily reject those informations which they have vouchsafed to give us of which our reason is not a competent judge  by the truth of these doctrines he evidently means the credibility of them but what he means by the exact consonance of those which are discovered to our reason we do not understand it is from the want of such consonance necessarily arising from the mysterious nature of such doctrines that we deduce the incompetency of reason to judge of their truth  but men as our author justly observes may very reasonably believe propositions to be true of whose truth nevertheless they are no competent judges if an able mathematician says he proves to us the truth of several propositions by demonstrations which we understand we hesitate not on his authority to assent to others the process of whose proofs we are not able to follow why therefore should we refuse that credit to christ and his apostles which we think reasonable to give to one another  why indeed it is very unreasonable they doubtless deserve our credit  but still we recur again to the authenticity of the history of the gospel and the interpretation of its doctrines admitting therefore the propriety of placing the utmost confidence in the veracity of christ and his apostles and that what they really meant to inculcate is worthy of all acceptance still we say the cautious and candid christian may without the immediate direction of divine grace remain at a loss what to believe  as to what genuine christianity requires us to believe here again we plead for the same necessary latitude in matters of faith as we have before done in morals we call it a necessary latitude because to whatever purity of faith or morals hypocrisy may pretend men always deceive themselves or others when they affect to have a command over their reason and passions which they can derive from no resource either of nature or grace the only springs of human reflection and action  indeed our author is in this respect and very justly a latitudinarian too for though he has reduced the christians creed as before observed to a very small compass he has by so doing opened a wide field for skepticism and yet so far are the dictates of genuine christianity even in our opinion consonant with reason that as it requires nothing which is impracticable to be performed so it requires nothing which is impossible to be believed  but how shall such a shortsighted being as man know what is or is not impossible  true he may be conscious of what is impracticable as that regards himself but he cannot prescribe impossibilities to god of whose omnipotence he is no judge to infinite power every thing is possible except indeed inconsistency or selfcontradiction every proposition therefore respecting the deity that does not involve a contradiction in terms however improbable or apparently impossible may yet be really possible and therefore believed on proper evidence powerful persuasion or the influence of divine grace whereas no kind or degree of evidence no power of persuasion no influence human or divine can possibly make any man believe a contradiction in terms  this is one of those impracticabilities which respects himself of the incompatibility of facts he may not be a competent judge but of the incongruity of his own deas he cannot but be sensible to a direct contradictionin terms therefore he cannot give his unfeigned assent though to the most egregious falsehood or palpable contrarietyin fact he may  this distinction between a contrarietyin fact and a contradictionin terms we conceive has not sufficiently been attended to the one is popular and physical consisting of natural inconsistency and moral improbabilities the other philosophical and logical consisting of artificial inconsistencies and verbal incongruities hence however incompetent human reason may be to determine of possibilities in nature and probabilities in providence it is competent to judge of the agreement and disagreement of its own ideas words therefore being the artificial signs of our ideas a contradictioninterms becomes obviously and certainly discaverable whilst a contrarietyinfacts is not  the greatest falsehoods in fact hence frequently pass for incontestible and demonstrable truths on those who would immediately detect a direct contradiction in terms  to illustrate this distinction by a familiar elucidation a man as totally ignorant of the copernican system as even the learned formerly were might be told that the sun is much bigger than the earth and does not move round it every twentyfour hours as it appears to do the earth only moving imperceptibly rounds its own axis and carrying round with it every thing adhering to its surface with great rapidity  an astronomer we say might tell an ignorant man this who might either believe it confiding in the astronomers veracity although it seemed contrary to the evidence of his senses or he might disbelieve and even deny it confiding more in that evidence he might say i cannot be persuaded out of my senses i can see the size of the sun and see it goes round the earth which i also perceive stands all the while stockstill it is impossible that i and every body about me should be whisked round with such velocity without our perceiving it  if therefore he should believe the astronomers assertion however true it be in reality he would believe what we call a contrarietyinfact viz that things really are as he perceives they are not the same illustration holds good respecting the existence of soul and body matter and spirit etc of which it is popularly supposed we have positive proos or indubitable demonstration whereas we have nothing more than the imperfect evidence of our sensations and perceptions which are so far from directly affording us demonstration of any thing that they are constantly and egregiously deceiving us in almost every thing  it will follow from the establishment of this distinction that however justifiable men of discernment may be in their disbelief or denial of inconsistent or selfcontradictory propositions the very limited extent of their knowledge in the works of nature and the ways of providence disqualifies them from taking upon them absolutely to deny improbable and even apparently impossible facts  another distinction which here offers itself to our consideration is that between believing the truth of a doctrine or the believing that a doctrine is true and the belief of that doctrine itself  for a man may very properly be said to believe the truth of a proposition in other words that such proposition is true although the doctrine or declaration it contains appears doubtful nay although the terms of such proposition be totally unintelligible in which latter case he certainly cannot with any propriety be said to believe the proposition or doctrine itself  the learned and ingenious author of a late plea for the divinity of christ mr robinson  lays down in form indeed the following proposition the belief of a proposition does not necessarily imply a clear idea of the object of which the proposition affirms any thing so that in this case a man may be said to believe a proposition he does not understand but to this we cannot subscribe a clear idea is certainly required as well of the subject as the predicate though not a full or adequate idea the idea entertained of god by a philosopher and that attached to the same term by an ignorant clown are widely different the one magnificent and extensive as human science can teach or imagination conceive the other mean and confined as ignorance and dullness can dictate we will yet venture to say they are both equally clear nay we conceive the confined idea of the clown may be the clearest as being more definite in coming nearer the precision of our ideas of material objects this very precision indeed is more destroyed by the effulgence of too much light than by the obscurity attending the want of it even as the face of the moon is seen clearer than that of the sun  no doctrine or proposition therefore can in our opinion be actually believed unless it be clearly understood and yet propositions which are not clearly understood nay not understood at all may comprehend a truth or may be true and that they do so is a proposition that may be believed  a man may believe as already observed a contrariety in fact a great falsehood supported by competent evidence or credible affirmation so may he with equal propriety and on the same grounds believe the truth of a mysterious or even unintelligible proposition or that such a proposition is true  but then this is not the proposition he believes this is quite a new one viz that the said mysterious or unintelligible proposition is true which new proposition is neither mysterious nor unintelligible and therefore may be believed it has been frivolously objected that a mathematician who demonstrates the truth of any proposition does not believe it to be true he knows it to be so true he does not only believe it to be true he does more he also knows it to be so he believes not only the truth of the proposition but the proposition itself knowledge includes belief though belief does not include knowledge   thus a magistrate or officer who administers affidavits ex officio and knows not the contents may on the credit and veracity of the deponent believe the truth of his deposition or that the contents of such deposition are true but he cannot with any propriety priety be said to believe such affidavit itself or the contents of such deposition because he knows not what those contents are and therefore can believe nothing about them  these distinctions lead us naturally to a third which we flatter ourselves may tend to conciliate the minds of polemical disputants or at least to abate their rancour which too often prevails between the orthodox and heterodox in religious disputes and this is the distinction before hinted at between the faith of the christian and the belief of the philosopher  the former does not require a rational conviction of the proposition believed whereas the belief of a philosopher not only requires rational conviction founded on positive evidence but it requires also a clear and precise comprehension of all the terms of the proposition laid down on the contrary the unfeigned assent or voluntary submission of reason to the truth of a proposition whose terms are not even perfectly understood is sufficient to entitle a christian to rank among the number of the faithful agreeable to our authors description of the nature of faith see page     but a philosopher who makes every thing submit to reason cannot believe either that which he does not clearly conceive or that of which he is not as clearly convinced  should he as a man be induced by any means or motives to give up the authority of his reason in matters where human reason is incompetent he would do this not as a philosopher but as a christian and of eourse be entitled to all the privileges and immunities attached to that character  of these our author has given an encouraging enumeration  unhappily for unbelievers they require a proof of the truth of even those advantages or what would answer the same end a belief or persuasion of their reality there can be no doubt but this would be sufficient to make them immediately adopt an expedient so admirably calculated to promote their ease and happiness but whence is such belief or persuasion to be derived from reason surely not unless the truth of the christian religion could be much more rationally proved than by what this writer calls demonstration  but what we ask again is demonstration and what is its influence intuition is not demonstration instinct is not demonstration perception is not demonstration nor is conceit demonstration and yet intuitive or instinctive impulse the force of imagination or firm persuasion may have equal influence on the mind with that of the clearest demonstration  this influence however is of another kind and though it be not rational it has often a greater effect over even rational creatures than the most clear and precise of rational deductions we experience this even in the common concerns of life in the more uncommon the force of inclination and the power of imagination are so notoriously known to overpower the strongest of our reasoning faculties that it were absurd to support the credit of demonstration in cases where even demonstration itself must give way to prejudice and prepossession  and if to prejudice and prepossession surely to the operation of grace and the influence of divine inspiration  that something more than the mere exercise of reason or even a good will or inclination to believe appears nenecessary from our authors own confession  there are people says he who from particular motives have determined with themselves that a pretended revelation founded on so strange and improbable a story so contradictory to reason so adverse to the world and all its occupations so incredible in its doctrines and in its precepts so impracticable can be nothing more than the imposition of priestcraft upon ignorant and illiterate ages and artfully continued as an engine welladapted to awe and govern the superstitious vulgar to talk to such about the christian religion is to converse with the deaf concerning music or with the blind on the beauties of painting they want all ideas relative to the subject and therefore can never be made to comprehend it to enable them to do this their minds must be formed for these conceptions by contemplation retirement and abstraction from business and dissipation by illhealth disappointment and distresses and possibly by divine interposition or by enthusiasm which is usually mistaken for it without some of these preparatory aids together with a competent degree of learning and application it is impossible that they can think or know understand or believe any thing about it if they profess to believe they deceive others if they fancy that they believe they deceive themselves i am ready to acknowledge that these gentlemen as far as their information reaches are perfectly in the right and if they are endued with good understandings which have been entirely devoted to the business or amusements of the world they can pass no other judgment and must revolt from the history and doctrines of this religion the preaching christ crucified was to the jews a stumbling block and to the greeks foolishness   cor i    and so it must appear to all who like them judge from established prejudices false learning and superficial knowledge for those who are quite unable to follow the chain of its prophecy to see the beauty and justness of its moral precepts and to enter into the wonders of its dispensations can form no other idea of this revelation but that of a confused rhapsody of fictions and absurdities  this is saying a great deal in discredit of a revelation whose divine origin is so obvious and whose doctrines are so reasonable as our author pretends surely there are no men of good under standings so entirely devoted to the business or amusements of the world as to be quite unable to form any other idea of revelation than that it is a confused rhapsody of fictions and absurdities  granting indeed it be so and that the pursuits of this world are so totally incompatible with the things of the next it surely affords a strong argument that reason is an incompetent judge in every thing relative to the system and that nothing but divine inspiration can effectually inculcate the dictates of divine revelation  the admitting that possibly divine interposition may be necessary to prepare some persons for believing the truths of the christian religion is in fact admitting that to be true in a degree and in particular cases which we contend for altogether and universally  we are sorry however to find such divine interposition put on a footing with illhealth disappointment distress and even enthusiasm  not that we conceive the mode of that interposition to be confined to unaccountable impulse or miraculous conversion natural means may in this case be made the forerunners of supernatural effects nay we will not deny that even enthusiasm or a false inspiration itself may be made the harbinger of the true  through even the foolishness of preaching were unbelievers formerly converted learning and study also may be made the concomitant means of grace but we do not conceive they are essentially necessary to give efficacy to other means or to divine interposition itself if they were it would not appear that god had chosen the foolishness of this world to confound the wise it would rather be the subjecting of divine wisdom to human sagacity and the excluding from christianity all but learned divines and profound philosophers  and yet says our author if it be asked was christianity intended only for these i answer no it was at first preached by the illiterate and received by the ignorant and to such are the practical which are the most necessary parts of it sufficiently intelligible but the proofs of its authority undoubtedly are not because these must be chiefly drawn from other parts of a speculative nature opening to our inquiries inexhaustible discoveries concerning the nature attributes and dispensations of god which cannot be understood without some learning and much attention from these the generality of mankind must necessarily be excluded and must therefore trust to others for the grounds of their belief if they believe at all  and hence continues he perhaps it is that faith or easiness of belief is so frequently and so strongly recommended in the gospel because if men require proofs of which they themselves are incapable and those who have no knowledge on this important subject will not place some confidence in those who have the illiterate and unattentive must ever continue in a state of unbelief  our author here seems to have run away from his argument the faith recommended in the gospel and therefore required of christians by god may be widely different from that required by men either of themselves or of others and of course the requisite proofs of the doctrines believed may be different also  we cannot admit therefore this necessity of any mans pinning his faith on his neighbors sleeve the most ignorant and illiterate man is no farther removed from god or incapable of receiving the illuminations of grace than the greatest philosopher or the most learned divine so that if men are content with believing only what god requires of them as necessary to salvation they may safely rely on him and the ordinary means of providence for instruction  the case is different with those who to gratify even a laudable curiosity are inquisitive about circumstances and doctrines unessential to salvation the object of that curiosity is a worldly object and if attained must be attained by worldly means they who possess not the means of original pursuit therefore must be content as a certain author expresses it to receive the object of it at second hand but the faith necessary to salvation is no such stale bargain it is the immediate gift of god  our author would have the inattentive and illiterate receive this gift at the hands of man and because uninformed reason is not to be depended on in matters of faith he advises them to rest their dependence on the information of those who professedly deduce what they know from the exercise of their reason they says he that is the inattentive and illiterate should all remember what perhaps they never knew that in all sciences even in mathematics themselves  itself there are many propositions which on a cursory view appear to the most acute understandings uninstructed in that science to be impossible to be true which yet on a closer examination are found to be truths capable of the strictest demonstration and that therefore in disquisitions on which we cannot determine without much learned investigation reason uninformed is by no means to be depended on and from hence they ought surely to conclude that it may be at least as possible for them to be mistaken in disbelieving this revelation who know nothing of the matter as for those great masters of reason and erudition grotius bacon newton boil lock addison and lyttleton to be deceived in their belief a belief to which they firmly adhered after the most diligent and learned researches into the authenticity of its records the completion of the prophecies the sublimity of its doctrines the purity of its precepts and the arguments of its adversaries a belief which they have testified to the world by their writings without any other motive than their regard for truth and the benefit of mankind  in a matter of so great importance we pay no authority even to great names without uncharitably questioning however either the sincerity or the motives of the several avowed defenders of christianity certain it is that some of them have been secretly contemners of its doctrines and privately disbelievers of its divine original  it is indeed justly to be suspected that the number of these is much greater than is generally imagined for however widely religious infidelity may have spread itself moral hypocrisy has in the present age kept pace with it  religious masquerading has in fact become so general and unbelievers so numerous that they keep one another in countenance while with unparallelled effrontery they take off the mask and openly belie the characters they assume thus our modish christians wear the plain face of downright heathens while they retain the domino or outward garb of christianity  this they do by explaining away as our author observes the plain and obvious meaning of scripture and modelling the articles of faith agreeable to their own imagination and yet these very underminers of genuine christianity who are daily sapping its foundation and preying on its vitals keep flourishing away with their misrepresentations of its prosperous and flourishing state  if christianity say certain bold reviewers in their critique on the pamphlet before us had been an imposture it could never have maintained its credit for almost eighteen hundred years or stood the test of the most acute and accurate examinations of friends and enemies of wits and infidels critics and philosophers of all denominations some fundamental defect some irreconcilable contradiction or some gross absurdity must have been discovered but this is so far from being the case that the more it is considered the more it convinces every new enquiry produces new light new evidence and from every fresh attack it gains an additional triumph  what an impudent abuse of the good faith of the christian reader what an insolent attempt to impose on his credulity  do not these very critics themselves pretend to have discovered fundamental defects irreconcilable contradictions and gross absurdities in the primitive and orthodox tenets of christianity do they not ridicule the doctrine of the trinity do they not deny the divinity of our savior do not they reject the tenets of vicarious atonement justification by faith and almost every essential article in the christian creed and do they still pretend that the mutilation of its very being is gaining additional triumphs to its cause shame on such baresaced irony we should not think it worth while to notice here even this gross misrepresentation of things by such anonymous critics as they are at present sunk deservedly so low in the general esteem of the public but as they have heretofore stood in much higher estimation and persons ignorant of their degeneracy might put the same confidence in them as formerly we think a landmark should be placed on the accumulating shoal lest the unwary mariner should suppose himself in a deep when he is barely floating on a shallow if any of their old friends are desirous to remain undeceived we leave them to make their own discovery in which case they will find themselves much in the situation of sancho pancha when his ass being stolen from under him while he was asleep he waked and found himself mounted merely on a packsaddle   the real state of the case is quite otherwise genuine christianity notwithstanding the vapouring of these nominal christians being never at so low an ebb as it is among our modern rationalists surviving chiesly among those who are ridiculed as contemned visionaries enthusiasts and fanatics the truth is that so far has pure christianity been from profiting by the freedom of enquiry with which its doctrines have of late years been treated that it has really lost ground among all the advocates for such enquiry  it is an idle boast that a mere belief in the mysteries of religion will stand the test of ridicule and defy the powers of rational investigation those mysteries themselves will undoubtedly do it because they depend not on the credulity or credibility of men but on the unchangeable promises of god but we see daily the most plausible professional characters laughed out of their religion and even the warmest zealots argued out of their zeal ridicule though not the test of truth is thus often the test of our adherence to it  so that if we were to calculate to how small a number of people genuine christianity is at present confined we shall have no reason to boast with this author the extent of its propagation and influence and still much less to advance it as a proof of its divine original it must be owned indeed that our author does not much boast of its present state comparing it with the ancient he says if it is asked why should not the belief of the same religion now produce the same effect the answer is short because it is not believed view page     the writers meaning is plain though not accurately expressed unless an indirect answer only was intended to the question   happily for christianity it has a much firmer support in the promises of its divine author than in any rational arguments that can be produced from such circumstances and happily for real christians their faith has a more unfailing resource in the operations of divine grace than in the most fertile expedients of human reason  sect xiii on his reply to the seventh objection that the whole scheme of revelation is partial false fluctuating unjust and unworthy of an omniscient and omnipotent author  this objection is conveyed in such diffuse and desultory terms that it amounts to little more than what has before been urged viz that the whole is incredible and bears no internal evidence of its divine original  and indeed if we suppose human reason to be a competent judge of the divinity of revelation and also of what is worthy or unworthy an omniscient and omnipotent being the objection stands in its full force  but we deny this competence as indeed does our author who observes that though reason is undoubtedly our surest guide in matters which lie within the narrow circle of her intelligence she is greatly deficient when she proceeds farther  god says this selfsufficient teacher reason is perfectly wise just and good and what is the inference that all his dispensations must be conformable to our notions of perfect wisdom justice and goodness but it should be first proved that man is as perfect and as wise as his creator or this consequence will by no means follow see view p       but says our author on the subject of revelation her province is only to examine into its authority and when that is once proved she has no more to do but to acquiesce in its doctrines   we have before hinted that we think reason has at least as much to do in the one case as in the other we shall now therefore only observe on this head that the monthly reviewers conceive it to be a very unguarded and dangerous position it precludes say they and discourages all rational inquiry monthly review for june      p       doubtless it does and properly all rational inquiry on a subject that does not admit of rational inquiry  but say they if it were pursued it would justify the wildest enthusiasm or superstition  how will an acquiescence or the putting an implicit faith in the doctrines of the scripture lead to the wildest enthusiasm and superstition is the human mind when directed by divine revelation more apt to err than when under the simple influence of reason these learned and ingenious gentlemen if indeed any gentleman ingenious or learned still continues to write in the mouthly review seems to think that reason has still wilder imaginations than those imputed to it by our author   we have already observed that in our opinion it is the duty of christians to submit the dictates of reason as well with respect to the authority of the scriptures as the truth of its doctrines to the influence of divine grace and it would be but modest in our rival reviewers to leave to the author of the foundation of our faith the care of its superstructure  they may rest assured that whatever extravagancies of enthusiasm or superstition men have fallen into it has not arisen from their putting an implicit faith in the doctrines of scriptures in other words from their submitting their reason to revelation but to their indulging in the pride of their hearts the wantonness of their imagination and trying their reasonable practices on such doctrines  sect xiv general reflections on the whole argument and conclusion in favor of universal candor in judging of the faith and morals of others or the exertion of christian charity toward all mankind  having thus assigned our reasons for thinking the human understanding a very incompetent judge either of the mysteries of our holy religion or of the proof of its divine origin we shall add only a few cursory reflections respecting the state of the argument in general  and first let us observe that were we disposed to take away even the slightest prop on which the popular belief of revelation rests we might expose to the greatest ridicule those vain boastings of vaunting casuists who declaring the truths of christianity to be sit objects of rational investigation invite the attacks of argument wit and ridicule and boldly bid them defiance among these we may particularize as of late the most eminent and conspicuous that ingenious and justly celebrated philosopher dr joseph priestly and his very able coadjutors in the theological repository  it was with a very bad grace also the celebrated author of the divine legation made a similar boast and threw out the same defiance against the freethinkers while the civil power was actually up in arms to crush one of the dullest and inoffensive insects of the whole tribe poor old peter annet it was certainly a glorious triumph over infidelity and a fine proof of the clerical faith in the impregnability of the christian church the getting a decrepid dotard of eighty sentenced to be imprisoned in newgate pilloried in the public streets and condemned to beat hemp in bridewell for a twelvemonth and all merely for pushing a few pitiful pellets out of the popgun of his wretched goosequill against the credibility of the mosaic history of the plagues of egypt  why was not the artillery of the ecclesiastical fortress levelled at some more formidable foe in their opposition to whom those doughty engineers might have reaped some credit for their valor if not for their conduct and have at least escaped the odium which ever falls on cowards for their cruelty  they may rest however secure the ashes of poor peter will remain quiet in his grave we dare say there was not so much spirit buried with them as to cause any future disturbance either to him or them we are assured that a late archbishop of canterbury thought the punishment of this poor man so much greater than his crime that he allowed him a stipend for life after he had submitted to and undergone the sentence of the law   the dignisied ecclesiastic abovementioned has been bold enough to say in some of his prefaces that the freethinkers as they are falsely styled have had fairplay in the argument that they have been left at liberty to handle the weapons of offense and defense at pleasure and yet have been foiled  but this is not true the freethinkers never had fairplay given them nor in fact do they deserve it if it were prudent in the civil magistrate to indulge them they are in general as little actuated by candor and the love of truth as their antagonists are by the detestation of falsehood and it must be owned of the latter they do for the most part love a little deception dearly  the writer of this critique can as truly aver his sincerity as the author of the pamphlet which is the subject of it he can truly say that with the most ardent desire of reconciling revelation to reason he long and laboriously attached himself to the study of the scriptures and the reading of the commentators that with the most earnest with to find the doctrines of christianity true and its divine origin morally evident he attended with the utmost candor to the authorities of ancient historians and the arguments of modern reasoners  and yet though early instructed to pay the most profound reverence and put the most implicit faith in the orthodox doctrines of christianity the more closely he applied the criterion of reason the more clearly did that criterion appear to be inapplicable the farther advances he made in human science the less compatible he found it with divine knowledge  he felt by no means the force of argument respecting the divine mission of our savior either from the completion of prophecies or the effect of miracles the history of the former seemed too problematical and legendary while the latter appeared to have had much less effect than they might reasonably be supposed to have on the very persons who were eyewitnesses of them  it appeared to him that the credit of christianity was so little established and even the name of its divine institutor so little known in its very birthplace and infancy that the magistrates themselves speak of one jesus acts xxv    it is true that this depreciating mode of expression is used by festus a new governor just come into office but it does not appear that king agrippa himself whom paul compliments with being expert in all customs and questions then among the jews knew any thing more of this jesus than the governor paul indeed would fain have persuaded him that he knew much more of the matter than he did or at least would seem to do he could not persuade him however to acknowledge himself a christian when he was not for that seems to be the true meaning of the passage as it seems the boldness and artfulness of the insinuation caused agrippa to get up and walk away  as of an obscure and unheard of stranger and of his sacrifice on the cross as a doubtful event  it appeared to him that if there were any thing supernatural in the propagation of christianity it lay in its subsequent progress in opposition to the incredulity of the times and the inefficacy of the miracles of christ and his apostles to diffuse a more general and earlier belief next to this he conceived the strongest proof that could be brought of the divine origin and of a supernatural interposition in the establishment of christianity is that the enormous wickedness of its later professors the flagitious the inhuman methods of propagating it together with the apparent absurdities contained in its mysterious tenets have not been able to bring it altogether into discredit even in the most scientific ages and with the most rational and humane nations of the world  here is indeed the appearance of something supernatural the fulfilling of the divine founders promise to the christian church that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it it is to an overruling providence and the irresistible power of grace in the completion of this promise as before observed more than to the strongest rational arguments that christianity owes its permanence and protection  depended its sacred mysteries on the force of reason what can be more rationally advanced in defense of the incarnation of jesus than of the incarnanations of vistnou depended they on rational arguments in favor of their truth what could reasonably be said in favor of a god the author of life becoming subject to mortality to his being born of a woman though not begot by a man to his dying the death of a sinner to atone for the sins of the saints to his descending into hell and his ascending again to heaven to reassume after all the pristine glory of the deity  if there be any thing in any religion more revolting to human reason than this we are unacquainted with the greatest apparent absurdities in the known world  if we are asked then whether as mere rational beings we can believe such propositions we frankly answer no  and yet experimentally convinced how short is the line of the human understanding how inadequate the strongest powers of sense and genius to penetrate the veil of nature and of providence we can readily submit our reason to revelation and give our unfeigned assent as christians to the truth of propositions which as men and philosophers we can neither fully understand nor clearly conceive  believing though not on any rational conviction that faith or as our author properly describes it an assent to the essential doctrines of christianity is a religious duty enjoined every man who lives under the dispensation of the gospel we believe even as men so much of them as we comprehend persuaded that even what we do not comprehend would command our belief if we did in the same proportion  we can unfeignedly do this even while the truth as it is called of such mysterious propositions appears doubtful nay while even the terms of such propositions appear in part or altogether unintelligible  it is a favorite maxim with our modern rationalists or as some call them divines that where mystery begins religion ends this maxim is in our opinion so far from being applicable to the christian religion that we think the faith of the christian applicable chiesly to its mysteries with which it begins and ends  there would indeed be something mysterious in the promulgation even of the morals of christianity if we could be brought to believe the practice of them in their declared purity to be in our present state required of us a practice so diametrically opposite to the gratification of the appetites and passions of human nature and even to the laws of justice and equity admitted in natural religion  to submit to every insult to return good for evil to love those that hate us and wish well to them that despitefully use us are tenets so contrary as well to our natural impatience of injuries as to our ideas of natural justice that however the meekspirited and graceendowed individual may adopt them in private practice no community of christians ever yet dared to admit them into their system of civil policy  as to the faith of the christian if it be not exercised on the mysteries of his religion we see neither use nor merit in his belief if he believe nothing but what appears rational and probable nothing but what is evinced by a cloud of witnesses and carries with it the clearest conviction in what is it more meritorious than the creed of the skeptic or infidel for even they have their creed  because thou have seen me faith our savior to didymus thou have believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed  we think this text perfectly applicable to such as like our author are anxious to prove the divine authority of the scriptures by rational argument in doing which we think them just as ill employed as this writer says they would be in pretending to accommodate the scriptural doctrines to our natural ideas of rectitude and truth  the welldisposed reader therefore submitting his reason to revelation and his belief of its divine origin as well as of its essential doctrines to a superior mode of conviction the influence of grace would do well patiently to wait the effect of its operation in gods own place and time and not be importunately anxious for the elucidation of obscurities which nothing but divine illumination can illustrate  for after all what men generally mean by the truth of the doctrines of revelation is their consonance or congruity with the deductions of commonsense and mere unenlightened reason  the trulydevout need be under no apprehension of being guilty of a neglect of religious duty in thus patientlywaiting for that inspiration from above which only can make them wise unto salvation  in the mean time they should not be surprised nor alarmed at finding their notions of divine truths not exactly to coincide with those of other men of whose talents gifts or graces they may entertain a higher opinion than they do of their own  as there are few if any persons in the world that either hear see or feel external objects exactly alike our nervous systems being as diversified as our features so there are as few that conceive exactly alike the meaning of any one moral or religious proposition even divine inspiration itself accommodating its influence to the different faculties of the individual  this reflection above all others should excite us to the exercise of that christian charity which covering a multitude of sins we should throw as a veil of universal candor over the mistakes and errors of the rest of mankind justly suspecting that with regard to others more enlightened than ourselves we may stand in need of the same indulgence  the end reason and grace theological logue the reader who has not been offended at the few verses quoted in the foregoing pages will not be displeased at the insertion of this apologue first prefixed to the fourth edition of the epistles to lorenzo beforementioned  do christian heathens still complain that infidels our creed profane yet harbor doubts so dark and nice they were in infidels a vice religion do they still pretend where mystery begins must end and yet affect in revelation to trace the means of mans salvation  over error let the truth prevail the truth though treated as a tale high on the imperial throne of grace where angels view their makers face as fondly in imagination men give him local habitation though natures universal mind by time and place is unconfined through clouds that canopy his throne seen by the eye of faith alone concealed the christian deity sat veiled in awful mystery with anxious heart and listening ear alternate slave to hope and fear devotion blind a pagan bred to visionary notions led with spirits of fantastic birth had pestered heaven and peopled earth in every stream through every grove did nayad swim or dryad rove on every whirlwind terror rode and spoke the presence of a god his breast with human passions fraught as folly dreamt or error taught till cautious reason scarce could tell the gods of heaven from those of hell twas now the one true god supreme dispersing darkness like a dream from heaven directed revelation beneath the christian dispensation those truths to teach which left alone to reason man had never known for it is by different means we trace the works of nature and of grace degenerate minds in contradiction full often from rational conviction yet reason piqud with envious pride at sight of this transcendent guide affected much to scorn her aid and scoffed at the celestial maid as if by simple nature given the special privilege of heaven whence they who gospel truths believe the same implicitly receive by grace intuitively taught without the aid of puzzling thought without the use of studied rules without the logic of the schools without the means that art supplies or science making blockheads wise for human wisdom here at fault its solemn forms are set at naught while through the wide worlds narrow bounds mere foolishness the wise confounds in heavens own manner time and place hence christians wait the call of grace whose operation from on high nor wit nor learning can supply the skeptic yet devoutly vain because he bows at natures fane though never the unregenrate mind may natures god behold enshrined persists with scrutinizing eye by logic gospel truth to try to make the sapience of the sage the standard of the sacred page and take for heaven in worldly pride a carnal for a spiritual guide hence each by reasoning led astray perversely takes a different way to the same chart they all pretend directs them to their journeys end cease ye discordant skeptics cease the gospel is the word of peace its mystries taught the human race alone by heavninspiring grace the sophist poring in the dark still syllogizes wide the mark the christian takes the book in hand and where he may not understand nor hesitates nor blindly pores but reads believe admires adores the difference then with me admit betwixt divine and human wit this but for this worlds purpose given that to direct the way to heaven to caesar pay great caesars due and take his coin for sterling true but dig not caesars richest mine to mix its ore with gold divine lest worse designing christianjews the dangerous precedent abuse adulterate with new allay and clip and sweat it all away it has been objected that this apprehension is groundless if the scriptural promises respecting the stability of the christian church are to be depended on but this objection is founded on misapprehension a particular people may forfeit through infidelity their title to that church without affecting its general stability or prosperity as experience has evinced there cannot also be a more fatal prognostic of christianitys forsaking any country than its being reduced to a mere name among its pretended professors for such we presume is the paganized christianity as bishop w calls it prevailing in the present day  errata page   note line   for france having read france
