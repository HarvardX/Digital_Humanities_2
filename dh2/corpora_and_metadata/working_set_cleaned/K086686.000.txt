the youth i sing who to himself unknown lost to the world and caledonias throne sprung over his mountains to the arms of fame and winged by fate his sires avenger came that knowledge learned so long denied by fate and found that blood as merit made him great the aged chieftain on the bier is laid and graced with all the honors of the dead the youthful warriors as the corse they bear droop the sad head and shed the generous tear for abrias shore tays winding banks they leave and bring the hero to his fathers grave his filial tears the godlike alpin sheds and toward the foe his gallant warriors leads the chief along his silent journey wound and fixed his rainy eyes upon the ground behind advanced his followers sad and slow in all the dark solemnity of woe mean time fierce scandinavias hostile power its squadrons spread along the murmuring shore prepared at once the city to invade and conquer caledonia in her head his camp for night the royal sueno forms resolved with morn to use his danish arms now in the ocean sunk the flaming day and streaked the ruddy west with setting ray around great indulph in the senate sat the noble chiefs of caledonias state in mental scales they either forces weigh and act before the labors of the day arrange in thought their caledonias might and bend their little army to the fight thus they consult brave alpins martial gait approached the portals of the dome of state resolved to offer to his king and lord the generous service of his trusty sword the unusual sight the gallant chief admires the bending arches and the lofty spires on either side the gate in order stand the ancient kings of caledonias land the marble lives they breathe within the stone and still as once the royal warriors frown the ferguss are seen above the gate this first created that restored the state in warlike pomp the awful forms appear and bending threaten from the stone the spear while to their side young aleion seems to rise and on her fathers turns her smiling eyes and next appears gregorius awful name hibernias conquror for a generous fame incassd in arms the royal hero stands and gives his captive all his conquered lands the filial heart of hapless alpins son in marble melts and beats within the stone revenge still sparkles in the heros eye around the picts a nameless slaughter lie the youthful warrior thus reviews with joy the godlike series of his ancestry the godlike forms the drooping hero cheer and keen ambition half believes the seer eager he shoots into the spacious gate his eye commands without his followers wait no frowning spearman guards the awful door no borrowed terror arms the hand of power no cringing bands of sycophants appear to send false echoes to the monarchs ear merits sost voice oppressions mournful groan advanced unstiffld to the attentive throne the hero entering took his solemn stand among the gallant warriors of the land his manly port the staring chiefs admire and halfheard whispers blow the soldiers fire a while his form engaged the monarchs eyes at length he raised the music of his voice whence is the youth i see fierce denmark warms each generous breast and fires em into arms a face once known is in that youth expressed and mends a dying image in my breast he said and thus the youth midst rocks afar i heard of denmark and of suenos war my countrys safety in my bosom rose for caledonias sons should meet her foes we ought not meanly wait the storm at home but rush afar and break it ere it come few are my follwers but these few are true we come to serve our country fame and you he said the king retorts thy form thy mind declare the scion of a generous kind with scotias foes maintain the stern debate and spring from valor to the arms of state whoever would raise his house in albion should lay the foundation in her enmies blood then to the chiefs supporters of my throne your sires brought often the roman eagles down yourselves my lords have caused the haughty dane to curse the land he tried so often in vain norvegian firs often brought them over the waves for albions crown but albion gaveem graves be still the same exert yourselves like men and of the invaders wash our rocks again though few our numbers these in arms grown old in albions and in indulphs cause are bold the brave man looks not when the clarion sounds to hostile numbers but his countrys wounds bold to the last and dauntless he will go on at once his countrys soldier and her son the monarch thus his royal mind expressed the patriot kindling in each generous breast each chieftains mind with pleasure goes before already mingling with the battles roar in thought each hero sweeps the bloody plain and deals in fancy death upon the dane dumbar arose the brave remains of wars silvered with years oerrun with honest scars great in the senate in the field renowned the senior stood attention hung arround he thus fierce denmark all the north commands and belches numbers on our neighboring lands englands subdued the saxons are overcome and meanly own a danish lord at home scarce now a blast from scandinavia roars but wafts a hostile squadron to our shores one fleet destroyed another crowns the waves the sons seem anxious for their fathers graves thus war returns in an eternal round battles on baules press and wound on wound our numbers thinnd our godlike warriors dead pale caledonia hangs her sickly head we must be wise be frugal of our store add art to arms and caution to our power beneath the sable mantle of the night rush on the foe and latent urge the fight conduct with few may foil this mighty power and denmark shun the inhospitable shore the senior spoke a general voice approves to arm his kindredbands each chief removes night from the east the drousy world invades and clothes the warriors in her dusky shades the vassalthrong advance a manly cloud and with their sable ranks the chieftains shroud each chief now here now there in armor shines waves through the ranks and draws the lengthened lines thus on a night when rattling tempests war through broken clouds appears a blazing star now veils its head now rushes on the sight and shoots a livid horror through the night the full formed columns in the midnight hour begin their silent journey toward the shore through every rank the chiefs inciting roam and rouzing whispers hiss along the gloom a rising hill whose nightinvelopd brow hung over the encamped squadrons of the foe shoots to the deep its ooze immantled arm and steadfast struggles with the raging storm here ends the moving host its winding road and here condenses like a sable cloud which long was gathringon the mountains brow then broke in thunder on the vales below again the chiefs in midnight council met before the king maintain the calm debate this waits the equal contest of the day that rushes headlong to the nightly fray at length young alpin stood and thus begun great king supporter of our ancient throne brought up in mountains and from councils far i am a novice in the art of war yet hear this thought  within the womb of night confirm the troops and arm the youth for fight while softlytreading to yon camp i go and mark the disposition of the foe or wakeful arm they for the dismal fight or wrapped within the lethargy of night are left abandoned to our scottish sword by sleeps soft hand in fatal chains secured if denmark sleeps in nights enfolding arms expect your spy to point out latent storms but they in arms too long delayed my speed then place the faithful scout among the dead a general voice the exploring thought approves and every wish with youthful alpin moves the hero slides along the gloom of night the campfires send afar their gleaming light athwart his side the trusty sabre flies the various played hangs plaited down his thighs the crested helm waves awful on his head his manly trunk the mail and corslet shade the ponderous spear supports his dusky way the waving steel reflects the stellar way arrived the dauntless youth solemnly slow observant moved along the silent foe some bracd in arms the midnight vigil keep some over the livid campfires nod to sleep the feeding courser to the stake is bound the prostrate horseman stretched along the ground extended here the brawny footman lay and dosing wore the lazy night away the watchman there by sleeps soft hand oerpowerd starts at the blast and half unsheaths his sword the exploring youth through nights involving cloud circling the foe their disposition viewed at length the heros dusky journey ends where haco feasted with his danish friends haco by more than suenos blood was great the promised monarch of the triple state the scandinavian camp the youth secured with watchful troops and not unfaithful sword two oaks from earth by headlong tempests torn supply the fire and in the circle burn around with social talk the feast they share and drown in bowls the caledonian war oerpowerd at length by slumbers silken hand they press the beach and cowr upon the strand a gallant deed the mountainyouth designed and nursed a growing action in his mind awful the chief advanced his armor bright reflects the fire and shines along the night hovering he stood above the sleepingband and shone an awful column over the strand thus osten to the midnight traveller the stalking figures of the dead appear silent the spectre towers before the sight and shines an awful image through the night at length the giant phantom hovers over some grave unhallowed stained with murdered gore thus alpin stood he exiles to the dead sixwarrioryouths the trembling remnant fled young haco starts unsheaths his shining sword and views his friends in ironchains secured he rushes headlong on the daring foe the godlike alpin renders blow for blow their clattring swords on either armor fell fire flashes round as steel contends with steel young alpins sword on hacos helmet broke and to the ground the staggring warrior took leaning on his broad shield the hero bends alpin aloft in air his sword suspends his arm upraisd he downward bends his brow but scorned to take advantage of thefoe young haco from his hand the weapon threw and from his flaming breast these accents drew bravest of men who could through night come on who durst attack and foil an host alone i see the man high on the warrior placed both mend each other in your noble breast accept brave man the friendship of a dane who hates the scot but yet can love the man he said while thus the scot with joy i find the man so powerful in an enmys mind your forces fled amidst nights dark alarms you both could stand and use your gallant arms such valiant deeds thy dauntless soul confess that i the warrior though the dane embrace his brawny arms he round the hero flung as they embrace the clashing corslets rung the dane resumes with the suns rising beam we may in fields of death contend for fame receive this shield that midst tomorrows storms haco may grateful shun his wellknown arms he said and gave the goldenameld round while as he reached the studded thongs resound the amicable colloquy they end and each a foe clasped in his arms a friend this to the camp his dusky journey bends while that to albions chiefs the hill ascends the exploring journey all with pleasure hear and own the valiant scout their noble care dissolved the council the attack declined each with the gift of sleep indulged his mind and midst his kindredbands supinely laid each softly slumberd on a mossy bed his mind to soft repose young alpin bends and seeks the humble circle of his friends reelining on a rock the hero lies and gradual slumbers steal upon his eyes still to his mind the danish camp arose hung on his dreams and haggd his calm repose once more he mixed with haco in the sight and urged impending on the danish flight end of canto first canto ii heavens opening portals shot the beam of day earth changed her sable robe to sprightly gray to wests dark goal the humid night is fled the sun over ocean rears his beamy head the splendid gleam from scottish steel returns and all the light reflexive mountains burns deepsounding bagpipes gaining on the air with lofry voice awake the scottish war the gallant chiefs along the mountains brow stand cassd in arms and lower upon the foe or awful through the forming squadrons shine build up the ranks and stretch the lengthened line each clan their standards from the beam unbind they float along and clap upon the wind the hieroglyphic honors of the brave acquire a double horror as they wave the southern warriors stretch the lines of war full on the right obedient to dumbar hardened to manhood in the school of arms he moves along sedately as he forms next deeply stretch their regular array to break the iron tempest of the day the sons of lennox and their gallant grahame often honored with the bloody spoils of fame he towers along with unaffected pride whilst they display their blazing arms aside great somerled possessed the middle space and ranged the kindred valor of his race the dauntless sons of morchuans rocky soil and the rough manhood of mulls seagirt isle the mountainchiefs in burning arms incassd and carrying all their country in their breast undaunted rear their useful arms on high now fought for food and now for liberty now met the sport of hills now of the main here pierced a stag and there transfixed a dane though natures walls their homely huts enclose to guard their homely huts though mountains rose yet feeling albion in their breasts they dare from rocks to rush and meet the distant war the fullformd lines now crown the mountains brow and wave a blazing forest over the foe the king commands down in array they creep their clanking arms beat time to every step as they descend they stretch along the strand restore the ranks and make a solemn stand before the camp the danish columns rise and stretch the battle to the clarions voice majestic sueno kept the higher place great in the war as in his noble race and when the sword to milder peace shall yield in council great as in the thundering field behind their king to either hand afar rough norways sons extend the front of war he moves incassd in steel and majesty along the ranks and plans them with his eye speaks his commands with unaffected ease and unconcerned the coming battle sees bent on his purpose obstinately brave to win a kingdom or an honest grave he seemed to look toward norways rocky shore and say  i will conquer or return no more far to the right fierce magnus fiery sway compels the troops and rears the quick array haughty he moves and catching flame from far looks toward the scots anticipates the war feels cruel joys in all his fibers rise and gathers all his fury to his eyes young haco on the left the battle rears and moves majestic through a wood of spears with martial skill the rising ranks he forms no novice in the irontrade of arms thus formed the danes in unconfusd array stretch their long lines along the murmuring sea their anchored ships a sable wood behind nod on the wave and whistle to the wind on either side thus stretched the manly line with darting gleam the steelclad ridges shine on either side the gloomy lines incede foot rose with foot and head advanced with head thus when two winds descend upon the main to fight their battles on the watery plain in two black lines the equal waters crowd on either side the whitetopd ridges nod at length they break and raise a bubbling sound while echo rumbles from the rocks around thus march the danes with spreading wings afar thus moves the horror of the scottish war while drowsy silence droops her mournful head whose calm repose the clanking arms invade the mountainyouth with unaffected pride twice thirty warriors rising by his side his native band precedes the scottish forms a shining column in the day of arms in act to throw he holds the ponderous spear and views with awful smiles the face of war nodding along his polished helmet shines and looks superior over the subject lines on either side devoured the narrow ground the moving troops  the hostile ridges frowned from either host the heralds awful breath rung in the trumpets throat the peal of death the martial sound foments their kindling rage onward they rush and in a shout engage the swords through air their gleaming journeys fly crash on the helms and tremble in the sky groan follows groan and wound succeeds on wound while dying bodies quiver on the ground thus when devouring hatchetmen invade with sounding steel the forests leavy head the mountains ring with their repeated strokes the tapring firs the elms the aged oaks quake at each gash then nod the head and yield groan as they fall and tremble on the field thus fell the men blood forms a lake around while groans and spears hoarse harmony resound the mountains hear and thunder back the noise and echo stammers with unequal voice as yet the battle hung in doubtful scales each bravely fought in death or only fails all all are bent on death or victory resolved to conquer or with glory die fierce denmarks honor kindles fire in these on these pale albion bends her parenteyes this sternly says shall denmarks children fly but that or save or with your country die the scots a stream would sweep the danes away the danes a rock repelled the scots array they fight alternate and alternate fly both wound both conquer both with glory die thrice haco strove to break dumbars array and thrice dumbar impelled him to the sea the fiery magnus foaming on the right pours on the mountainchiefs his warriormight the mountainyouths the furious chief restrain and turn the battle back upon the dane the ranks of sueno stand in firm array as hoary rocks repel the raging sea the hero to the phalanx crowds his might and calmly manages the standing fight not idly maddning in the bloody fray he wears delibrately the foe away straight on his spear the godlike alpin stood his flaming armor smeard with danish blood he casts behind an awecommanding look and to his few but valiant followers spoke the cautious danes o friends in firm array with perseverance may secure the day our people fall  let us their force divide invade with flame their transports on the tide they will defend the scots restore the day follow my friends your alpin leads the way he said and rushed upon the phalanxd dane the bending ranks beneath his sword complain arms groans of men beat time to every wound nod at each blow and thunder on the ground behind his friends advance with martial care move step for step and spread the lane of war he lowrs before and clears the rugged road they rush behind a rough and headlong flood thus on some eminence the laboring swain unlocks his sluice to drench the thirsty plain with mattock armed he shapes the waters course the liquid flows behind with rapid force thus valiant alpin hews his bloody way and thus his friends force through their firm array with great effort he seizes on the strand turns to his friends and issues his command thicken your lines the battles shock sustain and gall with vigor the recoiling dane brave caledonians face your countrys foe your lives are hers her own on her bestow he added not  the valiant youths obey the hero shaped along his rapid way rushed to the camp and seized a flaming brand then took his lofty seat upon the strand swift from his arm the crackling ember flies whizzes along and kindles in the skies the pitchy hull receives the sparkling fire the kindling ship the fanning winds inspire black smoke ascends at length the flames arise hiss through the shrouds and crackle in the skies the riding fleet is all in darkness lost its wreathy wings the flame spreads on the blast red embers falling from the burning shroud hiss in the wave and bubble in the flood great sueno turns and sees the flame behind swell its huge columns on the driving wind then thus to eric  urge your speedy flight recall the fiery magnus from the right quick let him come the endangered transports save and dash against the burning ship the wave the youth obeys and flying over the sand repeats in magnus ear the kings command the warrior starts rage sparkling in his eyes he towers along resounding as he flies he comes  from suenos army squadrons fall around the chief and rear the manly wall till in their front the stately chief appears they wave behind an iron wood of spears in all the gloomy pomp of battle lower and beat with sounding steps the fatal shore bent to support the flame his thin array young alpin draws along the murmuring sea he holds the massy spear in act to throw and bends his fiery eyes upon the foe advanced  with awful din the fight began steel speaks on steel man urges upon man groans shouts arms men a jarring discord sound gain on the sky and shake the mountains round fierce magnus here would rush into the main young alpin there would keep at bay the dane one pushes the swift boat into the sea through his bent back the faulchion cleaves its way another dashes to the ship the wave and bends at once into a watery grave spouts with departing breath the bubbling flood and dies the water with his foaming blood thus fought the men  behind the flame resounds gains on the fleet and spreads its wasteful bounds great magnus burning at the dismal sight advanced with rage redoubled to the fight degenerate danes  the raging warrior cries the day is lost  your fame your honor dies advance  condense your ranks  bear on your way and sweep these daring striplings to the sea the men advance  proceeds their haughty lord and wounds the air with his impatient sword bending where alpin reapt the bloody plain turn here is a man turn stripling here is a dane he said  the mountainwarrior turns his eyes then sternly wheels and with a blow replies great magnus falling on young alpins shield adds to the dismal thunder of the field revengful alpin with descending blade crashes the shining thunder on his head they aim defend their swords at every stroke talk on the way and gleam along the smoke at length on magnus fate deals home a wound he nods to death and thunders on the ground starting from the wide wound the bubbling blood sinks through the sand and rolls a smoking flood prone on the strand extended every way clad over with steel a shining trunk he lay thus on its lofty seat should winds invade the statue keeps the memory of the dead it quakes at every blast and nods around then falls a shapeless ruin to the ground the danes beholding their commander die start from their ranks and in confusion fly the youth pursues the flames behind him roar catch all the fleet and clothe with smoke the shore mean time great sueno denmarks valiant king round royal indulph bends the hostile ring hemmed in a circle of invading men they face on every side the closing dane deal blow for blow and wound return for wound and bring the staggring enmy to the ground great somerled argyles majestic lord through haralds sounding helmet drives his sword staggring he falls his rattling arms resound and in the pangs of death he bites the ground through hilrics shield great indulph urged the spear it pierced his breast and smokd behind in air groaning he sinks as when repeated strokes bring headlong to the ground the slaughtered ox brave grahame through mighty canute urged the spear where twixt the helm and mail the neck was bare pressed with the helm his ponderous head inclined he nodding falls as trees oerturnd by wind while thus the enmys front the chieftains wore and pild with hostile trunks the fatal shore by slow degrees their force declines away surrounding denmark gains upon the day great indulph stood amidst the warriorring all give attention to their valiant king hear me ye chiefs the mournful monarch cries we fall to day our state our country dies let us acquit ourselves of albions death and yield in her defense our latest breath he said and rushed from the surrounding ring and midst the battle sought the danish king ready to fight the royal warriors stood and longed to revel in each others blood while alpin rushing from the flaming shore with wasteful path pursued the flying power hewed through great suenos ring his bloody way and to the desperate chieftains gave the day rushed twixt great indulph and bold suenos sword and with his royal life preserved his lord brave sueno nods falls to the strand and cries o honor denmark lost undone  and die but still fierce denmark made a broken stand here stands a squadron there a gloomy band rears a firm column on the smoky shore makes the last efforts of a dying power thus after fire through lanes its way has took a prostrate village lies overwhelmed in smoke but here and there some sable turrets stand and lock a dismal ruin over the land so stood the danes but soon oerpowerd they fly stumble along and in their flight they dic norvegias sons of magnus fire bereft fell down before the chieftains of the left the great dumbar upon the right repelled young hacos force and swept him off the field he winds his hasty march along the coast fights as he flies and shields his little host at length within a wood over shades the sea with new felled oaks he walls his thin array bent on his fate and obstinately brave there marked at once his battlefield and grave end of canto second canto iii as when beneath the nights tempestuous cloud embattld winds assail the leafy wood tear on their fable way with awful sound and bring the groaning forest to the ground the trunks of elms the shrub the fir the oak in one confusion sink beneath the shock so deaths sad spoils the bloody field bestrowd the haughty chieftain the ignoble crowd the coward brave partake the common wound are friends in death and mingle on the ground dark night approached  the flaming lord of day had plunged his glowing circle in the sea on the blue sky the gathering clouds arise and tempests clap their wings along the skies the murmuring voice of heaven at distance fails and eddying whirlwinds howl along the vales the sky inwrapt in awful darkness lowrs and threatens to descend at once in showers the caledonian chiefs to shun the storm beneath a leafy oak their council form an ancient trunk supports the weary king the nobles bend around the standing ring with swords unsheathed the awful forms appeared their shining arms with danish blood besmeared their eyes shoot fire their meins unsettled show the battle frowns as yet upon their brow the monarch rose and leaning on the oak stretched out his hand and to the nobles spoke my lords the danes for so just heaven decreed even on that shore they thought to conquer bleed in vain death wrapped our fathers in his gloom we raise them in our actions from the tomb not infamous their aim over lands afar to spread destruction and the plague of war to meet the sons of battle as they roam content to ward them from their native home to show invaders that they dared to die for barren rocks for fame and liberty in you they live fallen denmarks host may show accept my thanks your country thanks you too he added not but turned his eyes around till in the ring the valiant youth he found approach brave youth the smiling monarch cried your countrys soldier and your countrys pride scotland shall thank thee for this gallant strife while grateful indulph owes to thee his life thus he advancing  and with ardour pressed the gallant warrior to his royal breast the unpresumptuous alpin bends his eyes and mixed with blushes to the king replies to save our king our countrys ancient throne are debts incumbent on her every son o monarch add it not to alpins praise that of this general debt his part he pays thus said the youth and modestly retired while as he moves the king and chiefs admired slow to his stand his easy steps he bears and hears his praises with unwilling ears the king resumes  o chiefs o valiant peers glad caledonia dries her running tears the warrior raised his faulchion over her head now sleeps forgotten on an earthen bed fierce scandinavias fatal storms are over her thunderbolts lie harmless on the shore but as when after night has beat a storm on the mild morn some spots the sky deform the broken clouds from every quarter sail join their black troops and all the heavens veil the winds arise descends the sluicy rain the storm with force redoubled beats the plain so when the youthful haco shall afar collect the broken fragments of the war the hero armed with suenos death may come and claim an expiation on his tomb deep in that wood the gallant warrior lies who shall to night his little camp surprise surround the martial dane with nightly care and give the final stroke to dying war hence norways ships shall shun our fatal sea and point the crooked beak another way if chance they spy where often their armies fell shall turn the prow and crowd away the sail he said no more the generous chiefs arise bent on the glory of the enterprise eager to climb through dangerous paths to fame the nightly war they severally claim one chief observed where godlike haco lay this knew the wood  and that the dusky way another urged his more unwearied friends and every chieftain something recommends thus for the arduous task the chiefs contest while each would grasp the danger to his breast the attentive monarch heard their brave debates and with a secret joy his soul dilates young alpin burns to urge the war of night to mix again with haco in the fight eager he stood and thus the chiefs adrest the warrior laboring in his manly breast king gallant chiefs  this enterprise i claim here let me fix my unestablishd fame already you have beat her arduous path reapt glorious harvests in the fields of death repeated feats fixed fame within your power but i gleam once then sink and am no more nor am i wholly ignrant of the fight i have urged the gloomy battles of the night aebudaes chief once touched on abrias strand and swept our mountains with his pilfring band all day they drove our cattle to the sea i went at midnight and rescued the prey with a poor handful and a faithful sword dispersed the robbers and their haughty lord twas i commanded  these the gallant men may we not act that midnight over again the hero spoke a murmuring voice ensued of loud applause  each heros mind subdued the glorious danger to the youth resigns he towers along and marshals up his lines some gallant youths to share his fame arise and mingle in the glorious enterprise the warriorband move on in firm array he towers before along the sounding sea through their tall spears the singing tempest raves and falling headlong on the spumy waves pursues the ridgy sea with awful roar and throws the liquid mountains on the shore in each short pause before the billow breaks the clanking caledonian armor speaks thus on some night when sable tempests roar the watchman wearying of his lonely hour hears some rent branch to squeak twixt every blast but in each ruder gust the creak is lost the king and gallant chiefs with wishful eyes pursue the youthful warrior as he flies his praise through all the noble circle ran  approached the ghastly figure of a man his visage pale his loeks are bleachd with years his tottering steps he onward scarcely bears his limbs are laced with blood a hideous sight and his wet garments shed the tears of night with slow approach he lifts his fading eyes and raised the squeaking treble of his voice o king i feel the leaden hand of death to the dark tomb i tread the general path hear me o king for this i left the field for this to thee my dying form revealed norway in vain had interposed her flood i come alas to pay the debt of blood possessed of crimes which the good king pursued in fell conspiracy unblest i vowed with fierce dovalus that i live to tell by us by us the great king malcolm fell touched with remorse behind my shield i laid his smiling child and wrapped him in my played now to the sea we urge our rapid flight beneath the guilty mantle of the night still in my arms i little duffus bear behind the voice of men and arms we hear my comrades fly  i lay the infant down and with my guilty life from vengeance run they found him saved him for i knew the voice it was  he said and closed at once his eyes slowly inclined and tumbling headlong down his guilty life breathed in a feeble groan the mournful monarch stood in dumb surprise the fate of malcolm filled afresh his eyes he folds his arms and bends his silent look then starting from the gloom of sorrow spoke you see my lords though denmarks hostile state long saved the traitors from the hand of fate yet heaven who rules with equal sway beneath snatched from her arms a victim due to death dovalus shall not sink among the dead but with that vengeance hangs over treasons head still malcolm still thou generous and thou best thy fate hangs heavy on a brothers breast you left a young you left a helpless son but lost to me to scotland and his throne perhaps oppressed with hunger and with cold he tends some peasants cattle to the fold or fights a common soldier on the field and bows beneath the scepter he should wield no more he said the noble circle sighed they droop the silent head nor aught replied now died apace the occidental light the subject world receives the flood of night the king from every side his troops recalls they fall around and rear their manly walls he issues to return the great command they move along and leave the fatal strand the city gained each soldiers weary breast forgets the day and sooths his toil with rest the king receives with hospitable care the gallant chiefs and drowns in wine the war within the royal hall the nobles sat the royal hall in simple nature great no pigmy art with little mimickry distracts the sense or pains the weary eye shields spears and helms in beauteous order shone along the walls of uncemented stone here all the noble warriors crown the bowl and with the generous nectar warm the soul with social talk steal lazy time away recounting all the dangers of the day they turn to alpin and the gloomy fight and tossed the gallant warrior of the night mean time young alpin girts the fatal wood and longs to mix again with danish blood already haco had with martial care with walls of oak embraced an ample square himself beneath a tree the storm defends and keeps in arms around his watchful friends the fair aurelia by the heros side an awful warrior and a blooming bride who placed in martial deeds her virgincare wields in her snowy hand the ashen spear a silver mail hung round her slender waist the corslet rises on her heaving breast on her white arm the brazen buckler shows the shining helm embraced her marble brows her twining ringlets flowing down behind sung grateful music to the nightly wind fate was unkind just as the lovers wed nor yet had tasted of the nuptial bed great suenos trumpet called the youth to war he sighed embraced and left the weeping fair with love emboldened up the virgin rose from her soft breast the native woman throws and with the gallant warrior clothes the wife following her haco to the bloody strife she sought her love through wars destructive path and often turned from him the hand of death the chief attentive all the youth surveyed and in the warrior found the lovely maid she leans inclining on her martial spear and only for the youth employs her fear the valiant scot assails the oaken wall the bulwark groans the brave defenders fall with sounding steel the firm barrier he plied and poured his warriors in on every side the godlike haco rushing through the night now here now there opposed the invaders might to every corner gave divided aid still still supported by the martial maid thus when the ocean swelling over the strand invades with billowy troops the subject land the sedlous swains the earthen weight oppose and fill the fissures where the tempest flows so valiant haco flew to every side and stemmed with pointed steel the manly tide with great effort preserved the narrow field and twixt the fair and danger kept the shield she only she employs the heros care haco forgot he only thinks on her he longs to sink with glory to the dead but can he leave in grief the captive maid her dying image hags his fancys eyes what should he do if fair auselia dies love mighty love arrested all his power he wished for flight who never fled before but as the lioness to save her young despises death and meets the hunterthrong so starting from the sable maze of care he faces death and shields the lovely fair the martial maid with equal love possessed would dart twixt danger and her hacos breast oppose her buckler to the listed spear and turn from him the iron hand of war now godlike aipin hewed his bloody path through danish ranks and marked his steps with death the enclosed square with desperate hand he shears and reaps a bloody field of men and spears groans crashing steel and clangour of the fight increase the stormy chorus of the night the danes diminished meet the unequal war where two fallen oaks confine an inner square join their broad shields the closewedgd column rear and on the scottish battle turn the spear on every side the caledonians close hemming the desperate phalanx of the foes to give the final stroke to battle crowd while haco thus bespoke the danes aloud ye sons of north unfortunate though brave here fate has marked out our common grave has doomed our bodies to enrich these plains then die revenged  like warriors and like danes he spoke and turning to the martial maid embraced her softly and thus sighing said shall then my spouse my love my only joy shall fair aurelia with her haco die thy death afflicts me  i in vain complain i will save aurella or expire  a dane he said and gathering up his spacious shield prepared to meet the battle in the field young alpin heard  it touched his feeling breast he stopped the war and thus the dane addressed our caledonia now relieved of fear feels pity rising in the place of care disdains to tyrannize over vanquished foes and for her steel on them her pity throws i now disiniss brave haco from the field and own the generous present of the shield he said  his thanks returns the royal dane himself escorts them to the sounding main a ship escaped the flame within a bay where bending rocks exclude the rougher sea secure from stormy winds in fafety rides and slowly nods on the recoiling tides thither they bend and launching to the sea plow with the crooked beak the watery way their sable journey to the north explore and leave their sleeping friends upon the shore end of canto third canto iv the sprightly morn with early blushes spread rears over the eastern hills her rosy head the storm subsides the breezes as they pass sigh on their way along the pearly grass sweet carol all the songsters of the spray calm and serene comes on the gentle day amidst attendant fair culena moves culena fruit of indulphs nuptial loves too soon to fate the beauteous queen resigned but

main behind her maids attend a modest train observe her as she moves with native state and gather all their motions from her gait thus through idalias balmdistilling grove majestic moves the smiling queen of love her hair flows down her snowy neck behind her purple mantle floats upon the wind the graces move along a blooming train and borrow all the gestures of their queen thus steal the lovely maids their tardy way along the silent border of the sea slowcurling waves advance upon the main and often threat the shore and often abstain a woody mound which reared aloft its head threw trembling shadows over a narrow mead from a black rock crystalline waters leap arch as they fall and through the valley creep chide with the murmuring pebbles as they pass or hum their purling journey through the grass pleased with the scene the wandering virgins stood the main below above the lofty wood their eyes they sat with the transporting scene and sitting press the fairenameld green enjoy with innocence the growing day and steal with harmless talk the time away mean time fierce corbred who preferred in vain his suit to agnes fairest of the train who fled from tweed to shun his hated arms intrusting fair culena with her charms saw the disdainful nymph remote from aid and bent his lustful eyes upon the maid he rushed with headlong russians from the wood and seized the fair the virgins shriek aloud for help for help the struggling virgin cries and as she shrieks aloud the wood replies alpin along  his men were sent before stalked on his thoughtful way along the shore the distant plaint assailed the heros ear he drew his sword and rushed to save the fair before the chief the dastard corbred fled and to her brave preserver left the maid prostrate on earth the lovely virgin lay her roses fade and all her charms decay in humid rest her bending eyelids close with slow returns her bosom fell and rose at length returning life her bosom warms glows in her cheeks and lights up all her charms thus when invading clouds the moon assail the landscape fails and fades the shining vale but soon as cynthia rushes on the sight reviving fields are silvered over with light the affrighted fair the gallant warrior leads to join upon the sand the flying maids they crowd their cautious steps along the sea quake at each breath and tremble on their way their timorous breasts unsettld from surprise to every side they dart their careful eyes thus on the heathy wild the hunted deer start at each blast together crowd through fear tremble and look about before behind then stretch along and leave the mountainwind the gallant youth presents the rescued fair confirms their trembling breasts removes their care the generous story from herself they hear and drink his praises with a greedy ear steal on the youth their eyes as agnes spoke and pour their fluttering souls at every look but fair culena feels a keener dart it pierced her breast and sunk into her heart she hears attentive views admires and loves her eye over all the man with pleasure roves with painsul joy she feels the flame increase her pride denies it but her eyes confess she starts and blushing turns her eye aside but love steps in and steals a look from pride thus fair culena struggles up the stream and tempts in vain to quench the rising flame at length with blushing cheek and bending look the imperial maid the warrior thus bespoke o generous chief for thus your deeds would say how shall our gratitude thy kindness pay indulph shall hear and indulph shall reward such generous actions claim a kings regard she said and thus the chief  imperial maid more than the debt thy approbation paid in this i did not strive with gallant men or drive disordered squadrons from the plain but frighted from his prey a sensual slave the gloomy sons of guilt are never brave whoever would seize on a defenseless fair would shun the sword and fly amain from war he said and stalked away with manly state grandeur with awe commixd informed his gait his ponderous mail reflects the trembling day and all his armor rings along the way the royal maid observes him as he flies in silence stands and from her bosom sighs slowly moves on before the silent fair and in the palace shuts her secret care mean time young alpin seeks the king and peers but fair culena in his bosom bears in vain against the rising flame he strove for all the man dissolved at once to love within the higharchd hall the nobles sat and formed in council the reviving state for instant peace solicitous prepare and raise a bulwark against the future war no highflown zeal the patriot hurled along no secret gold engaged the speakers tongue no jarring seeds are by a tyrant sown nor cunning senate undermines the throne to public good their public thoughts repair and caledonia is the general care no orator in pompous phrases shines or veils with public weal his base designs truth stood conspicuous undisguisd by art they spoke the homely language of the heart arrived the gallant warrior of the night they hear with eager joy the gloomy fight his conduct courage and compassion raise and every voice is forward in his praise the great dumbar his awsul stature rears his temples whitened with the snow of years on the brave youth he bends his solemn look then turning round thus to the nobles spoke beneath the royal banner scots asar had urged on humbers banks the foreign war my father dead though young i took the shield and led my kindredwarriors to the field the noble caledonian camp was laid within the bosom of a spacious mead greenrising hills encompassed it around and these king malcolm with his archers crowned full on the right a spacious wood arose and thither night conveyed a band of foes the kingcommands a chief to clear the wood and i the dangerous service claim aloud i went expelled the foes and killed their lord and ever since have worn his shining sword i now retire from war in age to rest take it brave youth for you can wield it best he said and reached the sword  the youth replied shooting the heavy blade athwart his side my lord with gratitude this sword i take esteem the present for the givers sake it still may find the way it often explored and glut with hostile blood its second lord to bloody honor hew its wasteful path a faithful sickle in the fields of death he thus  with placid mein great indulph rose and spoke thus always meet our albions foes with foreign blood your native arms adorn and boldly fight for ages yet unborn for us my lords fought all our godlike sires the debt we owe to them our race requires though future arms our country should enslave she shall acquit our ashes in the grave posterity degenerate as they groan shall bless their sires and call their woes their own let us my lords each virtous spark inspire and where we find it blow it to a fire thy service gallant alpin in this war shall both be indulphs and the senates care mean time with manly sports and exercise let us from business turn the mental eyes the mind relaxed acquires a double force and with new vigor finishes the course he added not the godlike chiefs obey all rise at once great indulph leads the way the palace here and there a virid mound confine a flowery spot of grassy ground the underrock emerging through the green chequers with hoary knobs the various scene thither repair the chiefs and sceptered king and bend upon the plain the hollow ring obedient servants from the palace bear the horny bow the helm the shining spear the mail the corslet and the brazen shield and throw the ringing weight upon the field imperial indulph towering over the plain with placid words addressed the warriortrain let those who bend the stubborn bow arise and with the feathered shast dispute this prize an antique bow a balearian wore when romans thundered on our albions shore the skilful archer dealing death afar threw on our scottish host the distant war great fergus springs a king devoid of fear and through his body shoots the reeking spear the bloody spoil through striving cohorts brings and sends this relic down to after kings thus grasping the long bow the monarch said rose valiant grahame and youthful somerled next gowal in the strife demands a part famed on his native hills to wing the dart full on the mound a helm their aim was placed and gowal drew the nerve first to his breast the bow reluctant yields then backward springs the nerve resounds through air the arrow sings close to the aim the earth the arrow meets and as it vibrates the bright helmet beats applause ensues  the shaft was sent by grahame and cut its brazen journey through the aim the prize on him the murmuring chiefs bestow till somerled assumes the ancient bow the dancing chord the leaping arrow left and rushing took on end grahames birchen shall tore on its way around the shivers fly and somerled brings off the prize with joy who cries the king this shield his prize shall bear and fling with skilful hand the martial spear behind this buckler mighty kenneth stood when tay impurpled ran with pictish blood he said and placed a mark the knobby round and measured back with equal steps the ground the valiant grahame the mountainyouth arose gowal again his martial stature shows bent on the knobby splendor of the prize first from his hand the singing weapon flies the steelhead marked a circle as it run flamed with the splendor of the setting sun thus when the night the weeping sky oerveils athwart the gloom the streaming meteor sails kindles a livid circle as it flies and with its glory dazzles human eyes thus flew the spear and sinking in the mound with quick vibrations beat the air around but missed the shield  grahames not unpracticed art dismisses through the air the murmuring dart full on the middle boss it takes the shield the fighting metals clatter over the field from the firm knob the point obliquely flies and on the field the trembling weapon lies next valiant alpin takes the ponderous spear and bending back dismisses it through air the long quick weapon flying over the field falls on the boss and perforates the shield the waving shaft is planted on the mound and with applause the neighboring rocks resound young somerled wrenchd from the rock a quoit a huge enormous sharp unwieldy weight such nowadays as many panting swains a witness rear on longcontested plains slowbending down at length the hero springs the rolling rock along the heavens sings falling it shakes at once the neighboring ground and on the face of earth indents a wound thus when strong winds the aged tower invade and throw the shapeless ruin from its head it falls and cleaves its bed into the ground the valley shakes and rocks complain around all try the mark to reach but try in vain all falling short unequal wound the plain alpin with diffidence assumes the stone for such a space had somerled over thrown the unwieldy rock a while he weighs with care then springing sends it whizzing through the air the wondering warriors view it as it rolls far over the distant mark the discus falls it shakes the plain and deals a gaping wound such as when headlong torrents tear the ground the applauding chiefs own in the manly game the hero great as in the fields of fame culena leaning on her snowy arms observant from the window points her charms the imperial virgin saw with pleasing pain the favorite youth victorious on the plain sadly she sighed accusing cruel fate which chained her in captivity of state the veil of night had now inwrapt the pole the feast renewed goes round the sparkling bowl great indulph rose with favourspeaking mein approaching alpin thus the king began say will the stranger tell from whence he came to reap this harvest of unrivaled fame nobler the youth who though before unknown from merit mounts to virtue and renown than he set up by an illustrious race totters aloft and scarce can keep his place the monarch spoke  attentive look the peers and long to drink his voice with greedy ears end of canto fourth cantov the hero rising from his lofty seat thus unpresumptuously accosts the great the fame of denmark passed our mountains over and filled our ears on abrias distant shore brave rynold starts  the aged chief alarms and kindles all his family to arms a hundred youths who from the sounding wood or towering mountain brought their living food obey the bagpipes voice for all in view of rynolds seat the friendly canton grew the hoary warrior leads the onward path no stranger to the road which led to death behind advancing i with martial care lead on the youthful thunderbolts of war with arms anticipate the kindling fire and move to every motion of my sire on grampus night her mantle round us throws we slept in heath  the dappled morn arose descending thence pursue our headlong way and cross the silver errors of the tay groans feeble shrieks ascending from the vale speak on the pinions of the southern gale a dismal scene breaks on our distant eyes here one pursues and there another flies this breathes his life through the impurpled wound while his proud villa smokes along the ground that with the foe maintains unequal strife while his dear offspring fly and dearer wife the senior saw it with indignant eyes and bid at once his kindredranks arise with hasty steps we seize a virid brow and form a sable cloud above the foe thus on the mountains brow i often have seen the mustring clouds brew torrents for the plain at length the blustering south begins to roar and heaven descends impetuous in a shower the bubbling floods foam down the hill and spread a swimming deluge on the subject mead thus rynold formed on the mountains brow and headlong rushed into the vale below while on the banks of tay terrific shine the steelclad foe and stretch the hostile line they form a wall along the flowing flood and awful gleam their arms an iron wood we shout and rush upon the hostile throng the echoing fields with iron clangour rung firm stood the foe nor made they flight their care but hand to hand returned the equal war man close to man and shield conjoined to shield they with the stable phalanx keep the field with pointed spear i marked the stoutest foe and heaven directed home the happy blow he tumbles backward to the groaning flood tay circles round and mingles with his blood my kindredyouth their useful weapons wield fomenting the confusion of the field dane fell on dane and man transfixed his man till bloody torrents smoked along the plain at length they fly along the banks of tay their guilty leader points the inglorious way eager we follow  still the foe with art wound as they fly and shoot the inverted dart rynold is wounded  still he urged the foe while down his limbs the crimson torrents flow with eager voice he still foments the strife preferring albions liberty to life an ancient pile upreard its revrent head and from its lofty seat surveyed a mead the mouldering walls confessed their beauty past a fragment falls with each invading blast old arms above the gate times empire own the rampant lion moulders in the stone tall elms around an old and shattered band their naked arms erect like centries stand within the ruined walls their fear enclose the desperate squadrons of the flying foes an ancient plane whose leafdismantled weight rude winds oerturnd secures the shapeless gate on every side my quick array i form prepared at once the muniment to storm missing my sire i fly to find the chief and give the wounded all a sons relief far on the plain the wounded warrior creeps and scarcely moves along his tottering steps but still far as his feeble voice could bear he kindles with his words the distant war quick i approached  he first the silence broke and leaning on his lance the warrior spoke say why returns young alpin from the fight pursue the foe and urge the danish flight i sink my son i sink into the grave you cannot me your country alpin save no more he said  i mournful thus reply compassion melting in my filial eye o sire the danes within yon walls secured will share our pity or must feel our sword of filial duty what his wants require i come to offer for a dying sire he thus returns still good still generous mind my wants are alpin of no earthly kind the world the fading world retires from view earth cloys me now and all it has but you go alpin go within that lofty wood a hermit lives a holy man and good relieve my son relieve me of my cares and for the dying rynold raise his prayers thus said  himself the wounded warrior laid within the coolness of a birchen shade some youths around employ their friendly care and over the dying shed the mournful tear around the ancient fastness guards i sent and to the lofty wood my journey bent two rising hills whose brows tall poplars grace with stretching arms a woody plain embrace along the treeset vale a rivlet flowed and murmured softly through the underwood along the purling stream my steps i bear and seek the lonely mansions of the seer irreglar files of towering elms embrace in their calm bosom an enameled space full at the end a rock with sable arms stretched over a mossgrown cave a grotto forms a silver stream clearissuing from the stones in winding mazes through the meadow runs depending flowers their varied colors bind hang over the entrance and defend the wind on a green bank the holy seer is laid where weaving branches cloud the checkered shade in solemn thought his hoary heads inclined and his white locks wave in the fanning wind with revrent steps approaching i began o blessed with all that dignifies the man who far from life and all its noisy care enjoyst the aim of all that wander there let holy father thy propitious aid guide dying rynold through the deathful shade i said  the prophet heavnward lifts his eyes long fixed in solemn thought and thus replies vain mortals worms of earth how can ye dare to deem your deeds not providences care heaven looks on all below with equal eye they long escape but yet the wicked die with distant time o youth my souls impressed futurity is laboring in my breast thy blood which rolling down from fergus came passes through time a pure untained stream albion shall in her pristine glory shine and blessed herself bless the fergusian line but ah i see grim treason rear its head pale albion trembling and her monarch dead the tyrant wield his scepter smeard with blood o base return but still great heaven is good he falls he falls see how the tyrant lies and scotland brightens up her weeping eyes the banished race again resume their own nor syria boasts her royal saint alone its gloomy front the lowering season clears and gently rolls a happy round of years again i see contending chiefs come on and as they strive to mount they tear the throne to civil arms the horrid trumpet calls and caledonia by her children falls the storm subsides to the calm flood of peace the throne returns to fergus ancient race glad caledonia owns their lawful sway happy in them in her unhappy they see each inwrapt untimely in his shroud for ever sleeping in his generous blood who on thy mournful tomb refrains the tear o regal charms unfortunately fair dark faction grasps her in his sable arms and crushes down to death her struggling charms the rose in all its gaudy livry dressed thus faintly struggles with the blustering west why mention him in whom the eternal fates shall bind in peace the longdiscording states see scot and saxon coalescd in one support the glory of the common crown britain no more shall shake with native storms but over the trembling nations lift her arms he spoke and in the cave enclosed his age in wonder lost i leave the hermitage measure with thoughtful steps my backward way while to the womb of night retires the day pale doubtful twilight broods along the ground the forest nods its sleeping head around before my eyes a ghastly vision stood a mangled man his bosom stained with blood silent and sad the phantom stood confessed and showed the streaming floodgates of his breast then pointing to the dome his tardy hand thither his eyes my silent way command he hands my sword emits a feeble groan and weakly says revenge me o my son i to reply  he hissed his way along as breezes sing through reeds their shrilly song i stood aghast then winged me to obey across the field i sweep my hasty way the men i arm  the firm barrier we ply and those who dare dispute the passage die with dying groans the lonely walls resound i on the guilty leader deal a wound through his bright helm the sword its journey takes he falls and thus with dying accents speaks just heaven in vain the wicked shun thy power though late thy vengeance yet the blow is sure this earth received the blood from off my hands a just return my own my own demands in nights dead hour when all but treason slept with ruffian bands a bloody train i crept twas here twas here oh longdeserved death twas here the godlike man resigned his breath the sleeping famly we with blood surprise and send the palace flaming to the skies i fled but fled alas pursued by fate it is now i find that i have sinned too late o malcolm o my king before my eyes he stands confessed  accursed dovalus dies his guilty soul in these dire accents fled i left with hasty steps the silent dead beneath the birch my aged sire i found his life was ebbing through the purple wound on me the aged senior lifts his eyes and mixes feeble accents with his sighs alpin the commerce of this world i leave convey my relics to my fathers grave ten friendly youths the homely rites shall pay lead thou the rest my alpin to the fray denmark invades  this was a pilfring band who spread divided terror over the land he said a qualm succeeds tears fill my eyes and woe securely shuts the gates of voice silent and sad i hang the dying over and with warm tears intenerate his gore the chief resumes  my brave my only son yes alpin i may call thee all my own i shall not veil a secret in my death take then this story of my latest breath the twentieth season livries over the year since on the severns banks i met the war in private feud against a saxon lord the great dumbar had raised his kindredsword i on the foe my bow auxiliar bend and join afar our famlys ancient friend returning thence i next the tay divide that very night the great king malcolm died my clan in arms might then preserve their king but fate withstood  along in arms we ring an infants cries at distance took my ear i went found thee a helpless orphan there the king who long infixd in dumb surprise run over the speaking youth with searching eyes here stopped him short his arms around him flung and silent on the astonished warrior hung my son my son at last perplexed he cries my duffus  tears hung in his joyful eyes the crouding tide of joy his words suppressed he clasps the youth in silence to his breast the astonished chiefs congealed in dumb amaze stiffend to silence on each other gaze sudden their cheeks are varied with surprise and glad disorder darted from their eyes as when before the swains with instant sound the forky bolt descending tears the ground they stand with stupid gaze each other eye so stood the chiefs oppressed with sudden joy at length relaxed from fetters of surprise welcome brave youth the sceptered senior cries welcome to honors justly thine alone triumphant mount though late thy fathers throne to thee with joy the scepter i resign and waft the kingdom to the coming line he said and thus the youth i only know to shoot the spear and bend the stubborn bow unskilled to stretch over nations my command or in the scales of judgment poise a land wield still the scepter which with grace you wear and guide with steadier hand the regal car while looking up to thee with humble eye i first transcribe my future rules of sway till late enjoy the throne which you bequeath and only date dominion from thy death resolved he spoke  bursts of applause around break on the chief  with joy the halls resound as when some valiant youth returns from far and leaves the fields of death and finished war whom time and honest scars another made and friendly hope long placed among the dead at first his sire looks with indifference on but soon he knows and hangs upon his son so all the chiefs the royal youth embrace while joys tumultuous rend the lofty place while thus the king and noble chiefs rejoice harmonious bards exalt the tuneful voice a select band by indulphs bounty fed to keep in song the memory of the dead they handed down the ancient rounds of time in oral story and recorded rhyme the vocal quire in tuneful concert sings exploits of heroes and of ancient kings how first in fergus caledonia rose what hosts she conquered and repelled what foes through time in reglar series they decline and touch each name of the fergusian line great caractacus fergus awful sword that bravely lost his country this restored hibernias spoils gregorius martial fire the stern avenger of his murdered sire beneath his sword as yet whole armies groan and a whole nation paid the blood of one at length descend the rough impetuous strains to valiant duffus and the slaughtered danes the battle lives in verse in song they wound and falling squadrons thunder on the ground thus in the strain the bards impetuous roll and quaff the generous spirit of the bowl at length from the elabrate song respire the chiefs remove and all to rest retire end of canto fifth canto vi now in the blushing east the morn arose its lofty head in gray the palace shows within the king and valiant chiefs prepare to urge the chase and wage the mountainwar the busy menials through the palace go some whet the shaft and others try the bow this viewed the toils that taught the horn to sound another animates the sprightly hound for the fleet chase the fair culena arms and from the gloom of sorrowwakes her charms the heros royal birth had reached her ear and sprightly hope assumed the throne of care around her slender waist the cincture slides her mantle flows behind in crimson tides bright rings of gold her braided ringlets bind the rattling quiver laden hangs behind she seized with snowy hand the polished bow and moved before majestically slow the chiefs behind advance their sable forms and with dark contrast heighten all her charms thus on expanded plains of heavenly blue thickgatherd clouds the queen of night pursue and as they crowd behind their sable lines the virginlight with double luster shines the maid her glowing charms thus onward bears his manly height aside young duffus rears her beauty he his manhood she admires both moved along and fed their silent fires the hunters to the lofty mountains came their eager breasts anticipate the game the forest they divide and sound the horn the generous hounds within their bondage burn struggle for freedom long to stretch away and in the wind already scent the prey at the approaching noise the starting deer crowd on the heath and stretch away in fear wave as they spring their branchy heads on high skim over the wild and leave the aching eye the eager hounds unchaind devour the heath they shoot along and pant a living death gaining upon their journey as they dart each from the herd selects a flying heart some urged the bounding stag a different way and hung with open mouth upon the prey now they traverse the heath and now assail the rising hill now skim along the vale now they appear now leave the aching eyes the master follows with exulting cries fits as he flies the arrow to the string the rest within the rattling quiver ring he as they shoot the lofty mountains over pursues in thought and sends his soul before thus they with supple joints the chase pursue rise on the hills and vanish on the brow on the blue heavens arose a night of clouds the radiant lord of day his glory shrouds the rushing whirlwind speaks with growling breath roars through the hill and scours along the heath deep rolling thunder rumbling from afar proclaims with murmuring voice the aerial war fleet lightenings flash in lawful streams of light dart through the gloom and vanish from the sight the blustering winds through heavens black concave sound rain batters earth and smokes along the ground down the steep hill the rushing torrents run and cleave with headlong rage their journey on the lofty mountains echo to the fall a muddy deluge stagnates on the vale culena moved a long the level ground a heart descends before the opening hound from the recoiling chord she twangd the dart and pierced the living vigor of the heart he starts he springs but falling as he flies pours out his timorous soul with weeping eyes as over the dying prey the huntress sighed before the wind heaven pours a sable tide and lowering threats a storm a rocky cave where monks successive hewed their house and grave invites into its calm recess the fair the reverend father breathed abroad his prayer the valiant duffus comes with panting breath faces the storm and stalks across the heath his sleeky hounds a faithful tribe before are bathed with blood and varied over with gore drenched with the rain the noble youth descends and in the cave the growling storm defends amazed astonished fixed in dumb surprise the lovers stood but spoke with silent eyes at length the distant colloquy they rear run over the chase the mountain and the deer far from the soul the evasive tongue departs their eyes are only faithful to their hearts the winding volumes of discourse return to hostile fields by gallant duffus shorn the imperial maid must hear it over again how fell dovalus was by duffus slain how by the son the fathers murderer fell the kindling virgin flames along the tale she turns she quakes and from her bosom sighs and all her soul comes melting in her eyes flames not unequal all the youth possess he for the first hears willingly his praise praise harshly heard from warriors kings and lords came down in balm on fair culenas words the royal pair thus fed the mutual fire now speak now pause when both alike admire he longs to vent the passion of his soul and she the tempests in her bosom roll now he begun but shame his voice oppressed loath to offend his eyes must tell the rest at length upon the headlong passion born he spoke his love and had a kind return she sighed she owned and bent her modest eyes while blushing roses on her cheeks arise thus on the vale the poppys blushing head brimful of summershowrs to earth is weighed fanned with the rising breeze it slow inclines while over the mead the rosy luster shines indulph into his cave the hermit led found erring through the mountains stormy head culena starting as the king appears looks every way and trembles as she fears on her mild face the modest blushes rise and fair disorder darted from her eyes the parentking observed the virgin whole and read the harmless secret in her soul a while the maze of calm discourse they wind at length the king unveils his royal mind warded from albions head the storm is over her prince is found her foes are now no more through time it is ours her happiness to trace it is ours to bind the future bands of peace posterity for albions crown may fight and couch ambition in the name of right with specious titles urge the civil war and to a crown their guilty journey tear i end these fears  the streams shall run in one nor struggling kindred strive to mount the throne i shield my daughter with young duffus arms and bless the warrior with culenas charms thus said the king their willing hands they join the revrent priest runs over the rites divine the solemn ceremony closed with prayer and duffus called his own the royal fair the storm is ceased the clouds together fly and clear at once the azure fields of sky the midday sun pours down his sultry slame and the wet heath waves glistring in the bea the hunter chiefs appear upon the brow fall down the hill and join the king below slow through the narrow vale their steps they bear behind advance the spoils of sylvan war far on a headland point condensed they stood and threw their eyes over oceans sable flood tall ships advance afar their canvassails in their swollen bosom gather all the gales floating along the sable back of sea before the wind they cut their spumy way bend in their course majestically slow and to the land their lazy journey plow thus spungy clouds on heavens blue vault arise and float before the wind along the skies their wings opposed to the illustrious sun shine as they move majestically on thus godlike harold brought his sloating aid unknowing suenos numbered with the dead from anglias coasts he called his troops afar to aid his brother in the foreign war arrived he in the wave the anchor throws attempts to land and aleions chiefs oppose wave on the fatal shore the pointed spear and send the arrow whizzing through the air the danes return the flying death afar and as they crowd away maintain the war an arrow tore through air its murmuring path fell on the king and weighed him down to death quick from the wound the blood tumultous sprung and over the sand the recking weapon flung prone on the strand an awful trunk he lies while sleep eternal steals upon his eyes the mournful chiefs around the dying stood some raise the body others stem the blood in vain their care  the soul for ever fled and fate had numbered indulph with the dead culena whom young duffus set apart with a green bank secured the hostile dart her fathers fate assailed her tender ear she beat her snowy breast and tore her hair frantic along the sand she run she flew and on the corse distressful beauty threw she called her fathers shade with filial cries and all the daughter streaming from her eyes bent on revenge the furious duffus strode and eyed with angry look the sable flood a ship which near had took its nodding stand fixed with the pitchy haulser to the strand remains of suenos fleet the hero viewed and to the mournful warriors spoke aloud let these whose actions are enchaind by years honor the mighty dead with friendly tears while we of youth descending to the main exact severe atonement of the dane he thus and rushing through the billowy roars with brawny arms his rapid journey oars divides with rolling chest the ridgy sea lashing the bubbling liquid in his way the boat he seized and measring back the deep wafted his brave companions to the ship

warriors gain swells on the approaching eye the floating dane fierce ulrics skill brought up the lazy rear famed in the fields of main to urge the war twice seven years in base pursuit of gain he plowed the waves the common foe of men at last to harold aiding arms he joined grasping the spoil with avaricious mind at first he shoots the leaping shaft afar and manages with skill the distant war the chiefs of albion with collected might bear on the foe and close the naval fight deck joined to deck and man engaged with man sword spoke with sword and scot transfixed his dane the smoking oak is covered over with gore if the whole pyratecrew are now no more the empty hull from wave to wave is tossed nods as it floats the sport of every blast the caledonian chiefs again pursue the scandinavian fleet over ocean flew telude the foe the danes fly different ways and cut with separate prows the hoary seas some bear to sea some rush upon the land and fly amain on earth a trembling band as in pursuit of doves on rapid wings the darting hawk through air his journey sings but when the parting flock divides the sky hovers in doubt this way or that to fly so undetermined long young duffus stood at length he sighed and thus begun aloud while thus o chiefs we urge the flying dine unmournd unhonourd lies the mighty slain it is ours to grace with woe great indulphs and over his fallen
