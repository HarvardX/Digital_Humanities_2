the divine model or christians exemplar to which is added the dramshop    dublin sold by william watson no   capelstreet  printer to the cheap repository for religious and moral tracts  and by the booksellers chapmen and hawkers in town and country  price one penny  the divine model etc endeavor to imitate your savior said mrs bingham one evening to her maid martha whom she was carefully instructing in the duties of religion imitate my savior repeated martha dear madam i thought he was so much raised above us that it would be quite presumptuous to try to be like him  it is true martha replied mrs bingham we can never be as perfect as our divine master but the nearer we approach to the example he has set us the better we shall be at all ages and in every situation of life when you were learning to write you know did not object to miss julias giving you good copies though you was well convinced it was totally out of your power to equal them  but maam again returned martha how can such a one as i imitate my savior did not he come down from heaven on purpose to live and to die for the sake of mankind now you know it is not in my power to do any such thing i cannot raise dead persons to life and heal the sick and give sight to the blind and make the lame walk besides how can i go about to teach others when i am so ignorant and so much in need of instruction myself  i well know said mrs bingham that neither you nor any of us can exactly perform the same actions as our savior did i only meant that we should endeavor to be guided by the same principle what do you think prompted him to be so wonderfully condescending as to leave that glory of happiness he enjoyed in heaven and to take our nature upon him with all its wants and infirmities certainly nothing but an earnest desire to do the will of his heavenly father and to prove his love to man by these dispositions our savior was actuated during his whole stay on earth and these dispositions should be cultivated by all his disciples  very true madam said martha  from our savior continued mrs bingham we learn the duty of prayer sometimes he passed the whole night in devotion he never joined in a meal but he first thanked god for the food he had provided and when he raised lazarus from the dead he piously expressed his gratitude to his heavenly father for enabling him to perform that wonderful miracle  o yes maam said martha i remember we often hear of his praying  our blessed lord too has taught us proceeded mrs bingham to bear provocation and even to forgive the greatest injuries should we not be ashamed of being put out of patience upon every trifling occasion when we see with what mildness the son of god bore with the neglect and dullness of his disciples how cordially upon peters repentance he forgave his denial and how earnestly he prayed for his murderers while hanging on the cross to which they had nailed him  dear i wonder i never thought of this before said martha is there any other way maam in which we may imitate our savior  yes martha we may imitate his humility he chose to be born in an humble station and aimed at no earthly riches or distinction by condescending to wash the feet of his disciples he proved to us that we should never be above stooping to the lowest offices for the good of others the benevolence of jesus i just now indeed recommended to your imitation we cannot it is true like him work a miracle to supply the wants of a multitude but though we are placed in a low station we may sometimes have it in our power from our own scanty meal to supply the hungry with a mouthful of bread we cannot cure the sick with speaking a word but we may by nursing them with tenderness promote their recovery or at least administer to their comfort in our own troubles we learn resignation from our saviors example in his agony just before his crucifixion his only prayer to god was that if he was willing he would remove from him the distress he at that moment endured but that nevertheless gods will might be done in the cruel treatment he afterward met with not a single complaint escaped him he seemed to be more concerned for his country his mother and his friends than for his own sufferings in short martha if you examine with attention the life of our savior you will find that he has himself set us the example of every virtue which he has commanded us to practice  martha would have been glad that her mistress should have proceeded farther but the bell rang and mrs bingham was obliged to join her family in the supper parlour  martha was a pious well disposed young woman she had never before considered that one design of our saviors abode on earth was to set us an example that we should follow his steps but the moment it was suggested to her she rejoiced to think that it was in any degree in her power to imitate the lord of glory and she determined to make it her endeavor in whatever she engaged to reflect how her savior would have acted in the same circumstances  in her prayers the next morning she did not fail to implore god to assist her to keep her good resolutions for she well knew that she was frail and sinful and that nothing but almighty grace could enable her to make any improvement  sally hague was a girl about thirteen years of age whom mrs bingham had taken into her family partly out of compassion to her parents and partly from consideration to martha who having a great deal both of housework and needle work to do she thought stood in need of some assistance  martha was too good a woman to make a slave of sally as is unhappily the practice of some servants who have girls under them as it is called but her natural disposition was hasty and sallys extreme dullness often put her patience to the proof and she was apt to reprove her in a sharp tone of voice  it was sallys business to put the study to rights against her master came down martha had several times shown her how to do it but on going into the room the morning after the above mentioned conversation with her mistress she found the books piled upon a wrong shelf her chairs out of their proper places the dust left in a corner and not a spark of fire to be seen  why you plaguey torment said she in an angry manner what in the world have you been doing there two hours i wish with all my heart my mistress had never hired you for i will be hanged if you do not make more work than you save now my master will be down in a few minutes and nothing will be ready and then a fine noise i shall have in my ears i suppose  i am very sorry said sally with tears in her eyes but cannot i do any thing now you do any thing repeated martha no nothing but go about your business you are always in my way you awkward hussy  sally walked flowly and sorrowfully to the other end of the room and martha who was banging about the tongs and poker with the utmost violence blushed to think how soon she had broken her resolution she compared her abusive language to this poor girl with the mild rebuke of our lord to his disciples for their repeated drowsiness at a time when he stood in most need of friendly consolation desirous of imitating his example she determined to conquer her ill humor let it cost her what it would and calling sally in a milder voice she said come and let me show you how to light the fire you should not cram the stove with coals and scatter the wood in separate places that will never do you should put the sticks across one another at the bottom in the front of the grate then put the large cinders lightly over them and a few round coals on the top and afterward with a piece of lighted paper you must set fire to the sticks through the bottom bars then it will burn up presently come do not cry there is a good girl you will do better tomorrow just as she said these words her master came into the room much earlier than usual finding his books moved from their proper place and his study in confusion he flew into a violent passion and cursed and abused martha in the most dreadful manner  martha did not attempt to vindicate herself by laying the blame upon sally for she remembered that her savior though loaded with false accusations held his peace yet when mr bingham had left the room as she brooded over the hard names by which he had called her she felt by no means inclined to forgive him and had an opportunity at that moment occurred she could have liked to have revenged herself  to overcome this vindictive frame of mind which she was conscious was displeasing to the almighty she reflected on the affectionate lamentation of our savior over jerusalem in which city he had been so often ill treated she thought too of his prayer for his murderers father forgive them for they know not what they do was this the way said she that the blessed jesus behaved to his enemies and shall not i pardon a few passionate words shall i not forgive him whom upon repentance god will forgive and for whom christ died she prayed a moment for a better temper and she quitted the study which she had now finished in a quiet and composed frame of mind  after breakfast as she was wiping away the crumbs a large piece of bread fell into the ashes no matter said she to herself it is but the bottom of a loaf and we may as well begin upon a new one at luncheon the words of her savior gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost cocurred to her memory and she picked up the bread immediately she remembered that these words were spoken at a time when jesus christ had been proving that he had all nature at his command by the wonderful supply he had furnished perhaps thought she when the broken pieces of bread and fish were spread over the grass they did not look of much value yet we are told they were sufficient to fill twelve baskets if all the scraps of this large family were fairly eaten how many pounds of victuals would it save in the course of a year it is possible my master and mistress would then give so much more to the poor at least the money that buys the food is theirs and we have no right to squander it  in the evening as the man and maids were sitting together the yard bell rung john said it was not his place to answer the back bell sally was up stairs betty and ann who were at work accused john of ill nature and declared they would not stir if the people rang the bell till they broke it martha was beginning to make the same silly declaration but the ran to the gate on recollecting the words of our savior that whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister  martha like the rest of the world loved her own ease and convenience she was fond of being treated with respect she could not bear to be thought lightly of and was disposed to stand up for her rights with whoever should oppose them yet when she considered the redeemer of mankind condescended to lay aside his glory for our sakes and that instead of being born as a great prince in which situation he might have had thousands at his command he took upon him the form of a poor man and gave up all his time to the good of others she was ashamed of her own pride and selfishness not a day passed but afforded some opportunities of subduing these bad dispositions by the imitation of the glorious example she had set herself to follow the attempt was for a long time attended with the greatest difficulty but her own endeavors and divine grace in the end so far succeeded that it appeared natural to her in most instances generously to prefer others to herself did a small piece of pudding or a custard or two come out of the parlour martha instead of insisting upon a right to a part was willing to give up her share to the others were there any little perquisites respecting which it was difficult to decide to which of the servants they properly belonged martha was the first to wave her claim  perhaps it may be thought that by thus laying herself open to be imposed upon by others she must have led a miserable life but i will venure to say that the disputes she avoided and the love and good will of her fellow servants which she effectually gained more than compensated for these little sacrifices  once martha deected sally in an atrocious falsehood t was a  of which she herself had never been guilty and of which she had greater horror than of almost any other  moified on finding the pains she had frequently taken to instruct her in her duty had been attended with so little success she for some time gave herself no further trouble about her and even indulged a growing aversion to the girl one idea however often presented itself and at last prompted her to redouble her diligence to prevent sally if possible from falling into bad courses  the savior of the world eat and drank with publicans and sinners the wretches whom all else beheld with scorn by him were received with kindness and directed in the way of everlasting life and would he thought martha for one crime have cast off poor ignorant sally  it was about two months from the time we introduced martha to the acquaintance of our readers when mary saunders a young woman with whom she was intimately acquainted called to inform her that her mistress was in want of an upper servant and that she was certain if she would engage to come immediately she might procure he place which she said was well worth having as the wages were ten guineas and the perquisites valuable martha hesitated mary would fain have persuaded her to return home with her and hire herself with mrs freeman immediately this however she would by no means consent to but thanking her friend promised she should have an answer the next morning  the moment she was gone she began to reflect very seriously on the proposal she had received she could not think without regret of quitting mrs bingham with whom she had lived from a child and who had always treated her with the utmost kindness to leave her so suddenly and for such a reason would appear both unhandsome and ungrateful and at this time in particular as her mistress was under the necessity of going for some weeks into the country and had several times told her that she entrusted her aged and infirm mother to her care during her absence yet was the temptation very great to enquire after a place where the profits would be considerably greater than at present her affections having long been engaged to a worthy young man to whom she was to be united as soon as their mutual savings should be sufficient to enable them to furnish a couple of rooms and purchase a few household materials  to fortify her mind to decline an alluring advantage she flew to her usual resource she perused in the fourth chapter of st matthew the account of our saviors temptation from our great ignorance of the nature of evil spirits it is not easy thoroughly to comprehend the nature of this part of his ministry yet we may learn from it sufficient to perceive that our lord was like us exposed to temptation and that he nobly resisted it this example was not lost upon the worthy martha whatever it may cost me said she i am determined to do my duty jesus christ delayed not a moment to answer the artful tempter i will therefore step to mary directly and tell her how i have made up my mind tomorrow morning i may be weaker  she accordingly with her mistresss leave went to mrs freemans immediately and not all the persuasions of mary saunders to whom she was extremely partial could prevail upon her to alter her determination  martha passed but a dull summer mrs dawson the old lady of whom she had the care was so helpless as to require constant attendance her spirits were bad and she suffered much pain so that she wept and complained incessantly marthas youthful vivacity made her desire a more enlivening scene and her patience was often on the point of being exhausted but the thought of the tenderness with which our savior heard the complaints of the miserable objects among whom he past his life and the readiness with which he relieved them taught her to substitute pity for disgust and to endeavor by every kind of attention to alleviate the poor ladys sufferings  but it would be endless to recite all the instances in which martha profited by seriously contemplating the spotless example of jesus christ suffice it to say that by this means she became one of the best of christians and most amiable of women far however from priding herself in her improvement the practice she had adopted of continually comparing her actions with those of her savior made her more sensible of her deficiencies unable after all her attempts to equal her exalted model she felt that she must be indebted to his mediation if her imperfect endeavors were accepted and gloriously rewarded by everlasting life  though she acted from no worldly view yet her heavenly father graciously thought fit to reward her even in this life she had soon reason to rejoice that she had not followed the advice of mary saunders as mr freeman became a bankrupt all his servants were suddenly dismissed and several received not the full wages due to them mrs dawson at her death left her a legacy of twenty pounds as a reward for her fidelity and attention and shortly after she became possessed of this sum she made the worthy youth happy who had long loved her and esteemed her virtues  a
