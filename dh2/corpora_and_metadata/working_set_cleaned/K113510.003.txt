outlines of the globe  vol iii  the view of india extra gangem china and japan  by thomas pennant esquire  vol iii  london printed by luke hansard great turnstile lincolns end fields and sold by john white horaces head fleet street  mdccc  advertisement the sad duty of publishing the posthumous works of a revered parent having devolved on me i now present the public with two volumes of the continuation of the outlines of the globe which comprehend a view of the interesting countries of china japan new holland and the archipelago of the indian ocean  as an editor my chief care has been to transcribe with accuracy from the original manuscript the finishing touch of the master may be wanting but the hand alas which gave the glowing tint is now cold and who shall dare to usurp the pencil some trifling additions distinguished by an initial have been made by myself and to john latham esquire i am indebted for an augmentation to the catalogue of birds of china and of new holland an objection may be made by some that no plates adorn these volumes  engravings except of novel objects or really illustrative and such notwithstanding much exertion it was not my good fortune to procure tend little to the value of a work of science two maps presumed more requisite have been constructed from the best materials  the biography of the valued author of the following sheets having been given by himself in his literary life to the commencement of the year      little remains for me to add to that period his health and felicity had experienced little interruption the illness of an amiable daughter then began to embitter his days and after the most unremitting attention that parental fondness could dictate he felt the cruel pang of separation on the first of may      this shock his spirits never completely recovered in the april of the ensuing year the patella of the knee snapped while descending a flight of steps an accident which confined him long to his room yet notwithstanding his advanced age and the bones never again reuniting he recovered sufficiently not only to walk without difficulty but to pursue his usual exercise on horseback  the year      gave to the world his account of the parishes of whitford and holywell the infirmities of nature now began to show themselves more evidently the loss of a friend and neighbor the worthy sir roger mostyn the subsequent distractions of the county of flint by jarring politics the melancholy situation of public affairs the progress of gallic barbarism which threatened to overturn all institutions social and sacred operated too forcibly on a mind of the acutest feeling and most exquisite sensibility mental agitation affected the corporeal system a difficulty of breathing a cough and other pulmonary affections induced him to apply for medical aid and he received from his friend dr haygarth then resident at chester all the assistance that art could give considerable discharges of blood from the nose increased the alarming symptoms still the energy of his mind sustained itself he continued his literary pursuits and employed his leisure hours during the greatest part of      in preparing for the press and rendering as perfect as possible his interesting view of hindoostan which was published early in the following year oedematous swellings in the legs announced the fatal cause of his disease but to expatiate more minutely on the sad catalogue of human evils might be irksome suffice it then to say that he bore their trial with fortitude and resignation a natural strength of constitution aided by a life of uniform temperance enabled him long to struggle against infirmity the progress of the disorder becoming more rapid toward the close of october he collected his nearest relatives and received with them the mysterious seal of our redemption conscious of his approaching end his eye beamed with hope tempered by the most serene and dignified resignation combining charity with devotion he observed that the ceremony would be incomplete indeed were it not accompanied by an act of beneficence to the poor this was the last duty of religion he performed his life had been a preparation for the aweful conclusion though soon after reduced to the inability of moving and suffering much he continued to share the conversation of his friends and relations except during the extreme pressure of pain or when opiates employed to procure a disturbed sleep or relieve the body from a few pangs produced their powerful effect and sacrificed the reasoning powers and the nobler faculties of the soul on the   th of december      the powers of nature were exhausted and the venerated author of my being expired without a groan  the pen of a son may not be calculated to record the character of an affectionate and beloved parent the bias of natural affection may operate too forcibly yet the silence of the person most intimately acquainted with the various virtues of thomas pennant would justly draw down the reproach of ingratitude  his religious principles were pure and fervent yet exempt from bigotry though firmly attached to the established church he by his writings and conduct conciliated the esteem of those of a different persuasion a steady friend to our excellent constitution he ever labored to preserve it entire this induced him to petition for the reform of some abuses during the administration of lord north at a period when the influence of the crown was supposed to have exceeded its due bounds this brought him forward in later times with additional energy to resist the democratic spirit which menaced tenfold evils the duties of a magistrate he exercised with candor with a temperate yet zealous warmth to protect the oppressed his benevolence to the poor was unbounded his repeated exertions to relieve the wants of a populous neighborhood by the importation of corn in times of scarcity were truly munificent temperate in diet he enjoyed the fruits of abstinence and until a few years previous to his decease possessed an unusual share of health and vigor his conversation was lively replete with instruction and brilliant with sallies of true humor yet too great sensiblity at times lowered his natural flow of spirits and occasioned severe dejection  of his literary character the public is the impartial judge and that public not only in this but in foreign countries has fixed on it the stamp of approbation blessed with a memory the most retentive his powers of composition were rapid his works were generally printed as they flowed from the pen with little or no correction hence some inaccuracies may be expected but their numbers are trifling  such candid reader is the true but imperfect sketch of the character of a man who to superior talents united the utmost goodness of heart  accept sainted spirit this unavailing tribute of filial duty may the example of thy virtues stimulate my exertions may my latter end resemble

india extra gangem i now enter on that portion of india which is distinguished by the name of india beyond the ganges the distinction is comparatively modern being known to the ancients in an imperfect manner here and there are scattered a few names which they could only have collected from the indian navigators but i shall mention in course any other lights which i discover they might have received  adjoining to chittigong is the kingdom of aracan kingdom of aracan which extends along the bay of bengal about two hundred miles in a southeastern direction according to mr rennels map a chain of mountains beginning in the southern part of chittigong skirts the sea the whole length of this kingdom as well as that of ava to within a few leagues of cape negrais the whole tract is infested to a very great degree with elephants and beasts of prey the topography of this country is very obscure the mouth of the river aracan the tocosannae of ptolemy river is placed in lat  0    m danville gives its whole course mr rennel more cautious and perhaps conscious of the uncertainty only delineates a small part aracan or from the capital aracan to the sea from aracan as high as lat    with the exception of a small portion between malaac and munnypour where it is traversed by the great communication from ava to the northern parts of bengal it is marked with a dotted line from that point the river is distinguished by a certain course which is continued northward in the kingdom of thibet as high as lat  0  0 all the great tract it passes through is level which makes it liable to annual inundations from the same causes as affect the bengal and other of the indian plains the tides which run up this river are very high they come in with a great bore and rise from fifteen to twenty feet according to the influence of the moon  there is six fathom water according to mr ovingtons account at the entrance of the river and twenty farther up so that it forms a noble harbor from the mouth to the capital is about fifty miles most of the way deliciously bounded by woods or plantations animated by the gambols of the monkey tribe or the gay flights of numbers of peacocks the city of aracan is seated most singularly in a valley surrounded with vast and craggy mountains these are assisted by art so as to prove the most substantial fortifications the entrances are cut through the solid rock as are the gates of the city the precipitous face of the mountains serves for walls besides these it has a citadel and other artificial defenses the city is said to be fifteen miles in circumference and to contain a hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants the regal palace is very magnificent and highly adorned and enriched with works of massive gold  in my outlines of the globe vol ii p     account of chittigong in the preceding volume i have related the share this kingdom took in the affairs of hindoostan by reason of the support it gave the portuguese pirates i shall now take notice of a very remarkable event which befell aracan the result of the misfortunes of sultan sujah of sultan suljah the second son of the emperor shah jehan and the unfortunate brother of that successful hypocrite aurengzebe after sujah had long made head against the usurper he was at length obliged to retire from his fastness near monghier to dacca and from thence to the kingdom of aracan he had previously sent his son to the king of the country to implore his protection this was immediately promised and the unhappy prince embarked with his whole family on board the vessels of the portuguese pirates settled in the mouths of the ganges intending to profit of the favor of the infidel monarch till he could procure a ship to convey him to the holy city of mecca from thence he intended to go to the courts of turkey or persia in hopes of an asylum in one or other of the dominions of those mighty potentates sujah is said soon to have discovered the perfidy of his royal host who had entered into a treaty with the general of aurengzebe to deliver into his hands for a sum of money the fugitive sultan this came to the ears of that prince who rashly determined on revenge he entered into a conspiracy against the aracan monarch gained over a certain number of mahometans resident in the country and with those and the few who were left of his train resolved to force his way into the palace to kill the king and cause himself to be proclaimed sovereign all this might have been executed aracan had not the design been discovered the unhappy sujah attempted to escape toward pegu he was soon overtaken his son sultan banque defended himself with a courage worthy of his birth till overpowered with numbers and fainting under his wounds he was seized and with his two little brothers his sisters and his mother carried away as to sujah he with one woman an eunuch and two other persons in ascending a mountain was knocked down with a stone by his pursuers the eunuch bound up his wounded head with a turban and they both escaped into the woods many relations were spread respecting this event in general he was supposed to have died either famished with hunger or fallen a prey to wild beasts mr dalrymple had picked up a story that sujah escaped to soolo an isle between that of borneo and magindanao where he long led an eremitical life that he died there and that a tomb was erected over his grave to this day an object of veneration with the mahometans  the tragical relation does not end here sultan banque and other fugitives who were brought back were at first treated with a tolerable degree of lenity the king even took to wife one of sujahs daughters this did not prevent banque and his companions from entering into another conspiracy which was detected the king of aracan determined to root out this illfated family he caused the heads of the men to be cut off with blunt axes the women to be immured and starved to death the lady alone whom he had honored with his bed was saved  the great quantity of gold and diamonds which had been brought into the country by sujah proved the cause of dreadful wars between the two sons of the king of aracan who succeeded him in    0 they quarrelled about the division of the treasure and never ceased from contesting the prize till both the competitors were destroyed many of the diamonds as is supposed were afterward sold to the dutch who happened to touch at aracan at very low prices by reason of the ignorance of the possessors  the next kingdom is that of ava kingdom of ava i shall comprehend in it three that of ava proper buraghmah or as it is vulgarly called burmah and pegu they once formed so many independent states governed by their respective monarchs but are now by conquest consolidated into one being subdued by the king of burmagh his dominions extend from the province of yunan in china as far south as the mouths of the ava a tract of eight hundred miles the standard of mahomet was never erected in these kingdoms all the inhabitants are rank idolaters their mode of worship and their rites agree in many points with those of the hindoos and they allow the doctrine of transmigration their pagodas and those of pegu very much resemble in form that of a bell tent the more northern part is the kingdom of burmagh that of meckly tributary to it forms on our maps a large vacant space to the west divided by a vast chain of mountains from silhet and tipera roshuan another void is to the south of meckly the kingdom of aracan separates burmagh for a considerable extent from the eastern part of the bay of bengal the coast of ava succeeds and runs washed by the sea as far as cape negrais an extent of above two hundred miles  the great river ava takes its rise far beyond the province of yunan river ava in china and as is supposed in thibet the chinese call it houkian i am uncertain where it becomes navigable possibly at the last customhouse in the chinese dominions at least we find that four people of that nation with some others embarked there on a voyage made in the last century down that river we have an account of it in vol vii     of the universal history it is described even at the customhouse as a large and rapid river they were twenty days in sailing to the city of ava and a month more from thence to pegu below the capital of the kingdom the vessels which navigate this mighty river are said to be as large as our biggest ships without sail but the planks have neither peg or nail to fasten them they seem to be sewed like the arabian vessels which will be described in vol of this work  mr dalrymple in p     of his useful repertory says he is assured that the river passes through a great lake not far above the city of ava this lake in the old maps such as speeds lake of chiamay is called chiamay and it is supposed that the rivers of siam and possibly of aracan chittigong and some others flow out of it the river is described as difficult of navigation by reason of ripplings and overfalls and its water during the inundations very cold occasioned by the snowy mountains from whence it flows  the borders of the ava after it enters burmagh are in some parts flat in others hilly but in none so low as to be overflowed the neighboring grounds are replete with saltpetre and quantities of common salt are procured by lixiviation from a black earth which abounds in this district it is now called the irabathy munchaboo the royal residence of the king of burmagh stands about twelve miles from the western bank in lat       a walled town of a square form containing four thousand families  ava the capital of the kingdom of the same name ava city is seated in lat       on the eastern bank of the river about    miles below munchaboo it is a very large city built of wood the streets strait and planted on each side with trees the kings palace alone is of stone but mean in its architecture it was in the sixteenth century prodigiously populous but was laid waste by the king of pegu in the most savage manner purchase vol ii      gives the horrible relation the jewellers of europe visited it in the same century for the sake of its rich gems at present ava is in a most ruinous state and does not contain above a thousand families the kingdom produces sapphires and rubies of the highest quality mention is made of its rich mines of copper lead and silver other provinces are rich in gold  from the city the river assumes the same name of ava takes a small curvature from thence toward the west and the channel becomes full of isles near pegongmew a town seated in a sterile sandy country and which from the remains of numerous pagodas seems formerly to have been a place of importance the ava takes a more southerly course between lat  0 and    north teek woods the western side is filled with an immense forest of teek trees which is said to produce the best timber of any in india it is floated down the river and is a considerable article of commerce prone once enclosed with fortifications lies on the left bank and is one of the principal trading towns on its course the environs are extremely fertile  at lundsey lundsey a town seated on the eastern bank in latitude     0 begins a rich fat soil formed by the mud brought down by the great annual inundations which this river is subject to like the ganges lundsey is distant a hundred and eighty miles from the sea the delta of the ava begins in about lat    and extends nearly a hundred and forty miles before it reaches the southern extremity the base or the lower part facing the sea is about two hundred miles all the upper part of the delta is clear land the lower seems filled with wood and divided by a number of channels into islands like the sunderbund of the ganges  ptolemy calls the river ava sabaracus that able geographer danville mistakes it for the burrampooter and accordingly we find it under that name in his maps the error is venial for he did not live to the time of our rennel  i shall now resume the coasts from the borders of chittigong coasts the country abounds with timber and the woods with all sorts of animals for food such as buffaloes deer and wild hogs here and there a few isles are dispersed along the shore some in groups isles others single or few together the isles are st martins not far above the mouth of aracan river the oyster islands nearly opposite and the bolongo a very little to it is south chedubah isle chedubah a large island in about lat     0 is supposed to be the bazacuta of ptolemy remarkable says he for the quantity of shells he adds that the inhabitants were called agmatae and that they went naked the sada civitas is placed on the coast of ava by m danville in lat    we are little acquainted with the country but that able geographer discovers it to have been a place still known by the name of sadoa near it was the sadus fluvius berabonna was another town of ptolemys seated on the same coast in lat     0 now called barabon and at the extremity of the southern side of ava is cape negrais in about lat    cape negrais the ancient promontorium temula from mr bakers survey in mr dalrymples collection it appears to be lofty and in part very precipitous the isle of negrais and another both off the mouth of the river form within them a noble harbor secure from all winds the english of late years wished to six here a settlement the country is incredibly fertile in rice and might have proved a fine resource to the coromandel coast and even to bengal in times of scarcity exclusive of the advantages to be derived from the harbor in time of war as to rice it is sold here at twelve pagodas a garce whereas in coromandel it is generally above thirty and sometimes even eighty a garce  the kingdom of pegu begins at this cape pegu the coast turns then suddenly to the east and extends above two hundred miles inclining after some way slightly to the north as far as the river of martaban the boundary between pegu and the province of martaban which adjoins to the kingdom of siam pegu is extremely narrow at the part next to cape negrais but it widens quickly so as to take in the whole delta of the ava and stretches north as high as lat    in the maps the coast of ava is comprehended in the kingdom of pegu we know so little of these countries of their revolutions and contrarevolutions that we dare not deny our assent to or controvert the relations of writers  the great branch of the delta is immediately to the east of cape negrais it is called the persaim river from a town seated about seventy miles from the sea on its eastern banks in      we had a factory on the opposite side the channel is very wide and deep having most of the way six and seven fathoms of water on each side are navigable canals that probably insulate part of the flat country to the east and to the west on the eastern part there is an inland communication from this river quite to that of pegu or the siriam river as there is through the sunderbunds of bengal isle of negrais negrais isle marshy and wooded lies just within the entrance and on the outside is diamond isle small and surrounded with rocks immediately before the front of the whole delta are banks of mud or sand of great extent formed by the waters of the ava depositing their foul load before the mouths of the several discharges the marcura metropolis of ptolemy stood in about the middle of the delta and must have had its navigable approach i do not know that any of the discharges are at present useful in navigation like the channels between the islands of the sunderbunds till we reach the entrance of that which leads to the town of siriam this known by the name of the siriam siriam is a branch of the river of pegu and contributes to form another delta the town is about thirty miles from the entrance near it are factories belonging to the french english and dutch raynal hist of europ set vol ii p     says that the armenians carry on a great trade in topazes sapphires amethysts and rubies the river was known to ptolemy by the title of besynga and gave its name to the modern river of pegu  the other exports of pegu are teek timber elephants ivory exports beeswax lac iron tin indigo oil from different woods oil of earth or naptha and of fish here are mines of gold and silver but neither of these are worked the iron is native and found in masses of fifteen or twenty pounds weight and ready for the manufacturer also plenty of sulphur and saltpetre but the exportation of the last is most strictly prohibited rice is cultivated in great abundance in the low lands of the country but no attention is paid to any sort of manufactures except that of cotton for home consumption  i may observe bees that the bees of the torrid zone are the same with the european there being only one species producing honey which is the apis mellifica no attempts are made either in india or the hotter parts of africa to hive these admirable and useful insects they inhabit the hollows of trees from which their treasures are taken  lac is the production of another insect a species of chermes lac undescribed by linnaeus doctor roxburgh a naturalist now rising in hindoostan gives us an account of its operations in the philosophical transactions vol lxxxi p     tab vi  under the name of chermes lacca this like the be forms cells pentagons hexagons and irregular squares which at samulcotta in orixa the doctors residence are affixed to the branches of the mimosa cinerea the

lively each cell contains about a hundred the eggs they proceed from are lodged in the cells in a deepred liquor these are the females the males are winged and are not in proportion to the females more than one to five thousand but they are four or five times their size the eggs and the liquor they are lodged in give a most beautiful red doctor roxburgh acknowleges that the subject from which

bengal great quantities of indian goods imports and some european especially hats the coco palm does not grow in pegu the nut is therefore a considerable import dampier shipped eleven thousand and five or six hundred pounds weight of sugar as presents for the king  the river of pegu arises in the province of yunan river of pegu in china passes through the upper part of the kingdom of siam and forces its way through a great chain of mountains in about lat  0    which run from north to east dividing siam from pegu here it assumes the name of that kingdom city the capital city stands on the eastern bank in about lat      in its prosperity it consisted of two parts the old and the new the last was the royal residence and completed about the year      by mandaragri the second burmagh king a tyrant monarch arose who oppressed his subjects to such a degree as to encourage the neighboring princes to invade his dominions and in      he was besieged by them in his capital the portuguese in conjunction with certain turks caused the siege to be raised but out of a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants only thirty thousand were left all the others perished either by the sword or famine it had at that time three thousand cannon for its defense of which one thousand were brass the kings of aracan and tangu took advantage of his distress the city was again besieged surrendered to the latter and the unfortunate monarch and his whole family put to death by order of his own sister queen to the victorious king the place was foon deserted and the seat of empire transferred to ava the city of pegu was of vast size a regular square with four grand streets leading to four gates and being seated on a plain a person at the center could see them all at once though the city was a mile each way the houses were built with bamboo it was surrounded with walls and a deep wet ditch stocked with crocodiles crocodiles to prevent people attempting to get in or out of the city by swimming or wading  the bore or head wave of the tide bore or head wave which runs up this river is of amazing violence and rapidity people who have the misfortune of being shipwrecked on the banks near the shore at low water or ebb of tide are obliged to seek the land with all possible speed for fear lest they should be swept away on its entering the channels and the mouths of rivers the noise is most tremendous the bore is said to be sixteen feet high the barks which run up the pegu river are carried with the rapidity of an arrow out of a bow if they cannot finish their voyage in a tide they anchor on some of the numerous sand banks with which the river is filled the expansion of the tide on those elevated parts lessens the danger as soon as the barks begin to be lifted up they prepare for their voyage at a certain time the mariners loosen their anchors and are carried on as i describe if they or even the largest ships lay in the channel they would certainly be overset and the crew and the cargo at once overwhelmed in the wave for this reason large ships seldom venture to navigate this river but discharge their lading at siriam from whence it was wont to be conveyed to pegu in barks  the portuguese very soon got considerable interest in this country but by their profligate conduct were expelled by the reigning monarch sylveira his sad fate one thomas sylveira had by his valor done considerable service to the king in the siamese wars he became a prime favorite had his state elephant and bodyguard allowed till one day passing through the streets and hearing the mirth of nuptial merriment in a burghers house stopped at the door and understanding that the bride was a virgin of uncommon beauty requested a sight of her the bridegroom thinking it an extraordinary honor brought her to the side of sylveiras elephant the russian caused her to be seized and carried to his house the unhappy bridegroom unable to sustain his loss cut his throat the relations rent their clothes and ran through the streets appealing to their gods and monarch for revenge the king heard the complaint caused sylveira to be seized and to be dragged at the foot of an elephant through the streets till neither skin or flesh were left on his bones and all the portuguese in pegu except the few who could escape by flight were instantly massacred  the last great mouth of the pegu river is the sitang sitang river it divides the kingdom of pegu from the province of martaban martaban the city of that name was for some time a royal residence and had once been the capital of an independent monarchy but was attacked and taken by the king of ava who murdered the sovereign massacred the inhabitants and reduced the place to ashes after this hamilton account of the east indies vol ii p    says that the conqueror sunk large vessels laden with stones at the mouth of the port which was once a fine harbor so that at present only small ships can enter it had formerly been the most flourishing commercial town of the east and still retains its potteries and manufactures jars glazed with lead ore large enough to contain two hogsheads hamilton also mentions its fisheries and adds that its dried mullets exceed in delicacy all fish of the kind  from the mouth of the martaban harbor the course runs due south as far as the isle of junkseilon isle of junkseilon an extent of above five hundred miles the coast of martaban takes in about a hundred and forty of the computation the currents along the shore are most swift and violent the country bordering on the sea little known and very barbarous it is skirted with small isles and is full of danger  the natives of the kingdom of pegu natives of pegu resemble the malays in appearance and disposition but are more industrious their masters the buraghmahs are liker to the arabs in their features and of a darker complexion than the peguers they are much addicted to commerce and so numerous even in pegu as to exceed the natives as  00 to   they tattow themselves and by rubbing in gunpowder the marks become permanent the men are stout made they paint their thighs in graceful flourishes  the lower siam lower siam part of the great kingdom of siam begins in lat     0 town of mergui the town of mergui stands on an island in the mouth of the river tenasserim in lat       it was once a most flourishing emporium till it was by the tyranny of the government almost totally deserted and the whole neighborhood became the habitation of wild beasts mergui was at the close of the last century much frequented by the english free merchants but they were recalled by the east india company they likewise had a fort here now in ruins during the inundations there is a passage from mergui to juthia or the capital of siam which may at that season be performed the greatest part of the way on rafts in three weeks but in the dry season the passage takes twice the time the river runs several leagues due east and after it has passed the city of tenasserim turns to the north and keeps for a vast length of way toward its origin which is said to be in china the river and the town of mergui were the daona of ptolemy and the city of tenasserim the berobe  a great chain of mountains divides the kingdom of siam in two it begins to the east of tenasserim and pointing north passes through the kingdom of ava continues its course

continent the channel has all the way good soundings good anchorage and regular tides which on the springs rise to twelve feet captain thomas forest in      took a most accurate survey of these islands and proved the advantage of a knowledge of the channel between them and the main land at p p i ii of his preface he shows how our indiamen may in their way to europe save the hazard of being embayed and losing their passage by taking this route and by getting round atcheen head in sumatra proceed to europe  all the isles are mountanous and may be seen in clear weather at the distance of fourteen or fifteen leagues and most of them finely wooded many of the trees are very lofty among them is the poon tree or uvaria altissima so useful for masts and the coco palm of such universal use in all parts of india in pegu the nut is esteemed a necessary of life nearly as much as rice  the islands are of various sizes and forms but generally very small many exactly of the shape of a beehive and clothed with woods a few are very rocky and so rudely broken as to seem flung up by a mighty convulsion such are the rocks called the cupelo the largest isles are st mathews st susannas and sullivans or the domel among them are some very good harbors particularly hastings bay in the isle of st matthew hastings bay mr forest proposed a settlement to be formed of the natives of hindoostan on some of the islands in order to profit by the rich commerce of pegu he says slate and marble are found here and that there is plenty of coral to burn into lime he adds swallow i e a sort of actinia in great request in china as a delicacy and also the edible birds nests  about a hundred and fifty leagues to the west of the most eastern part of the archipelago of mergui are the greater and lesser islands of andaman islands of andaman ptolemy calls the first insulae bonae fortunae perhaps says m danville because navigators might exult at escaping from shores infamous for being inhabited by a barbarous anthropophagi the ancient name of the lesser andaman was maniole all the islands even as far as the group off the west end of sumatra labored under the same scandal  the great andaman is about a hundred and eight miles long and extends from north to south between lat       and       it is nearly of the same breadth or between thirty and forty miles the mountains rise rude and lofty that called the saddleback is seen twentytwo leagues distance at sea by captain wraggs view there appears a considerable bay on the western side with a fine river running into the southern part this is the island which marco polo calls angania and says that the inhabitants live like wild beasts on fruits and also human flesh and that they have heads and teeth like dogs but that their island abounds with fruits and all sorts of perfumes the bramins say that these isles are inhabited by devils incarnate animated by the souls of impious men in respect to the teeth of the inhabitants it may be in some measure true for in many parts of the eastern world the natives are used to file their teeth into the form of those of the canine species  frederic caesar a traveller of authority purchase ii    0  sailed by these islands about the year      he made the same report of their barbarity and adds that they refuse all commerce with strangers and have small barks with which they attack and take any vessels they can master and kill and eat the prisoners caesar met with two of their barks having on board nuts and fruit they refused money and were prevaled on to exchange some of their fruits for old rags but could not be induced by any means to come on board  hamilton vol ii    speaks of them as a fearless people that they will swim off to any boat which approaches their island and attack it with their wooden weapons in defiance of numbers of our musquetry and of the missive and defensive weapons of iron and steel they annually make an excursion in their preos or little barks to their neighbors of the nicobar isles and kill and take prisoners all they can the nicobarians are a quiet people but once they took courage and collecting their force gave battle and totally defeated their barbarous enemies the same writer from the report of a native who had been taken prisoner when young by some nicobarians and was converted to mahometanism made frequent voyages to his native islands and often returned with four or five hundred weight of quicksilver with which he said they abounded  the whole of the greater andaman is skirted with small islands mr dalrymple makes mention of a cluster inhabited by men most savage in their appearance quite black and with woolly hair like the african caffres their noses not so flat for in feature they resemble the malays they go naked have canoes and use one end of their paddle as a bow to shoot with  at a great distance from the eastern side are the barren isle and the isle of narcondra a vast mountain rising out of the sea a

mountanous this group was called by ptolemy insulae sindae and the sombrera barussae we are made tolerably well acquainted with these islands by means of dampier who on discovering the piratical designs of his captain one read prevaled to be set on shore and with two or three achenese who were landed after him resided there some time he represents the natives as honest civil and harmless husband of one wife and according to the english rule till death does them part they are neither addicted to quarrel theft or murder in their persons they are tall and welllimbed their visages long noses well proportioned and their whole features agreeable their hair lank and black their skins a deep copper the men go naked excepting the wrapper which passes round their waist and from thence under the thighs and brought so as to tuck before the women wear a short petticoat not reaching lower than the knee  these people have neither an apparent government or religion each man is patriarchal the ruler of his own family their property consists in the plantations of coco palms coco trees which are along the shores the country inland seemed not cleared and impervious by any paths  they have another tree of use which they call the melory melory it grows wild dampier who was very observant says he never saw any in other parts of his travels he adds it grows to the size of our larger apple trees that the fruit is as big as a penny loaf of the shape of a pear with a smooth greenish rind the inside is like that of an apple but full of small strings it is their chief food they either eat it boiled or scrape the pulp clear from the strings and make it into a cake as large as a dutch cheese which will keep six or seven days and has a good taste they have a few small hogs and some poultry  the principal employ of the natives is fishing their canoes are sharp at each end flat on one side and unequal on the other and have some slight outriggers these vessels go either with a sail or paddle and hold from nine to thirty men  the nicobar islands produce the beautiful and singular pigeon pigeon to which they give name the feathers on the head are purple those of the neck long

them stands mount parcelar a noted seamark to ships navigating this dangerous straight  still more to the south malacca city in lat    0 is malacca the capital city of the peninsula it probably succeeded perimula as the emporium of this part of india when the great albuquerque had made his country sovereign of ceylon he turned his thoughts toward this territory and determined to give to portugal the whole commerce of the east at that time malacca possessed the entire trade of india ships from every port of hindoostan from china the phillipine and the molucca islands from persia arabia and even africa filled its harbor the arabians brought with them their religion and established mahometanism in the court of this kingdom as they had done in that of hindoostan  this port was first visited in   0  by the portuguese admiral lopez sequiera taken by the portuguese on his arrival he met with the most friendly reception from the reigning monarch but such a jealousy arose among the commercial people of the different nations especially the arabs which they so effectually instilled into the prince as soon to destroy the good understanding between him and the strangers he had so suddenly taken an affection for his conduct had lulled the portuguese into so deep a security that numbers of them took up their residence in the city and sequiera even appointed araujo a favorite of albuquerques as consul the prince did not dare to attack the admiral by open force but used every species of treachery to destroy him finding his plots detected he ordered his subjects to massacre the europeans who were in their power numbers were slain but araujo and a few others were kept as hostages to prevent the revenge of the admiral who after various endeavors to recover them was obliged to leave them behind and to set sail for the malabar coast  albuquerque took advantage of the quarrel he sailed from goa in      and soon appearing before the port of malacca clamed the release of his countrymen these demands were at first refused but after some hostilities the king was so terrified as to send to albuquerque araujo and all the surviving portuguese notwithstanding this it was discovered that he intended nothing less than the destruction of the europeans it is evident he had great reason to suspect his new guests for albuquerque among other requests desired leave to erect a fort to secure his countrymen from any future attacks this the king knew was only a prelude to the subjection of him and his subjects to a foreign yoke the refusal was followed by the landing of the portuguese several severe skirmishes ensued which as usual ended with the defeat of the indians the city was forced and the palace taken by storm but though the king found means to escape with all his valuable effects albuquerque got two hundred thousand ducats to his share of the plunder among other means of resistance the malayes placed in the way of the assailants a sort of chevaux de frize with poisoned points no people are so expert as the malayes in that dreadful art the city was also defended by three thousand cannon a number of artillery surprising in those days the monarch fled to the woods where he soon died of grief this success of albuquerques struck all the neighboring nations with admiration the king of siam and the princes of sumatra and java and the other neighboring isles sent to him ambassadors and various rich presents those from java very politically presented him with spears and darts all kinds of hostile weapons and pieces of embroidery representing the warlike exploits of their master to impress on the stranger an idea of the valor of the javanese monarch  the portuguese from time to time fortified malacca in a manner suitable to its importance and it became the greatest emporium in india by this wise stroke of policy albuquerque gave to his country the possession of the gold the gems the spices and other rich productions of india ultra gangem and its islands as he did before those of hindoostan by the capture of the famous city of goa  the portuguese continued in possession of malacca till the year      expelled by the dutch when it was wrested out of their hands by the dutch after a six months siege the governor is accused by historians of treachery and to have been bribed into a surrender but it is certain that he did not give the place up till after the most gallant defense the dutch sensible of its value paid the utmost attention to its fortifications and to every thing that could revive the ancient commerce which had almost sunk to nothing by the tyranny and usual ill conduct of the portuguese  the city had in their time several fine churches and numbers of monasteries and the jesuits a noble college in which they exercised great hospitality all these of course fell to decay under the reign of the sons of calvin sharp as they are they were outwitted by the sons of rome the religious of the several convents made a request to the conqueror that they might be permitted to quit their houses in solemn procession each carried a large waxen taper in his hand within which were concealed their diamonds and all the lesser treasures the victors were defrauded of the fruits of their valor and as sonnerat says their commander lost his head on his return to holland for not having sagacity enough to discover the trick  malacca is exceedingly large much of it is built of strong bamboo but the several stone buildings among them the governors house make a conspicuous figure a narrow but deep and rapid river divides the town from the fort one side of which is washed by the sea in that part only four leagues distant from the low land of sumatra malacca is a true emporium or mart the great magazine of the various rich articles of commerce brought from the several countries i have mentioned as to the peninsula itself it yields little more than the sine tin and elephants teeth let me conclude that this place was celebrated among the ancients for its gold aurea chersonesus for which reason it was called by them aurea chersonesus still at no great distance from the city of malacca is a hill called the golden mount some imagine this to have been the ophir of solomon i shall mention in vol of the outlines of the globe the supposition that ophir was a place in aethiopia i will not enter into the dispute and only say that if the birds which we know at present by the name of peacocks were those intended   kings chapter x verse     this or some other part of india might have been the place from which solomon drew his wealth peacocks being found in plenty here and unknown at least in those days in any part of africa  to the south of malacca is the small kingdom of johore kingdom of johore we have scarce any acquaintance with it and know little more of its history than that it was governed by a brutal set of princes and that in      a rebellion arose which ended in the expulsion of the royal family  the southern entrance into the streights of malacca is filled with a most numerous archipelago of small isles even to the shores of sumatra the land from tanjong buro in johore bends into a crescent likewise filled with isles one is called sincapour streights of sincapour which gives name to the wellknown passage for ships bound to or from the east there are several other channels between the islands but that of sincapour is the best yet all are subject to danger by reason of the rapidity and irregularity of the tides and the reefs or sand banks which are found in some or other of these narrow passages the western horn of the crescent is cape romano this stands in lat      cape romano and is the most southern point of the continent of asia a little to the west of that point on a large river stands the city of johore or batusabar erroneously supposed by m danville to have been the same with the zaba or sabana emporium of ptolemy the cape romano is certainly the magnum promontorium or malaeucolon a name borrowed from the ancient malayes romano seems to be a traditional name used in memory of the nations which frequented the adjacent port where the ships must often have been obliged to wait for the proper wind to enable them to double the great promontory and pursue their voyage to the several marts on each side of the gulf of siam  for the tracing the remainder of the coasts on the continent i shall no more consult the opinion of my able guide m danville but follow that of a countryman mr john caverhill who in the lviith volume of the philosophical transactions has given a very able criticism on those parts of ptolemy which relate to these particular shores  after doubling the cape romano the peninsula takes a north northwestern direction between lat      and pulo varela in lat    0 is an extensive group of small isles which fill the sea for a considerable breadth almost to the very shore the largest is pulo timon pulo timon in passing down the streights of malacca as far as cape romano navigators are obliged to take an eastern course dampiers voyage ii    this proves how well ptolemy was informed when he said that the roman ships bound for cattigara took that direction but afterward when they had doubled the cape they being hurried easterly by the tide which rushes through the streights of sincapour were under the necessity of making a tack and proceeding westerly to reach the several ports they might be bound for in the magnus sinus  pahang port pahang and town are in lat    0 and in a most fruitful country the mouth of the river has an island before it the north channel has at high water the depth of four fathoms and just within the bar good anchorage in six the estuary is a mile broad but so full of sand banks that it is with great trouble a vessel of thirty tons can work up to the town distant twelve miles from the sea the river rises far up the country washes the foot of the hill of malacca gold and contains a vast deal of gold hamilton visited this country in      and reports that lumps of five or six ounces weight have been found the diverse usually descend to the depth of three fathoms but the greatest lumps of the precious metal are found in ten some years eight hundred weight have been exported well may this country have been supposed to have been another ophir josephus lib viii c ii seems to have been right in fixing it here if his authority was good for saying that the ancient name of this part of india was sophora now the land of gold which comes so very near to that of ophir possibly the word is the malayan name for the precious metal m le poivre says that the inhabitants of malacca and sumatra call their gold mines ophirs and mr marsden voyage to sumatra p    that in the latter island is a hill named mount ophir possibly from its having been once rich in gold  much pepper is cultivated on the sides of the river pepper about three hundred tons have been sent to market but had there been a demand three thousand might be raised in the space of five years the best canes in the world are said to grow in these parts  trangano or tringoran trangano a small town a little to the north of pahang is seated on a river near the sea in which small ships may moor securely among the rocks the town did consist of above a thousand houses half of which are inhabited by chinese who traffic in their jonks to siam cambodia and tonquin trangano is most deliciously seated amidst low hills covered with the eternal verdure of undeciduous trees lemons oranges fruits mangostans and all the fruits of the indies grow here in perfection and the valleys laugh with grain pulse and sugar but all owing to the industry of the chinese the feudal malayes are too lazy to make the earth yield its increase pepper is raised in great abundance but the port is shut up from october to march by a most violent sea driven in by the northeast monsoons in the still months the sea is said to afford the finest of fish ptolemy places either in the neighborhood of this town or pahang a place called thagora  latitude   passes over part of the group of the ridang isles ridano isles which lie not remote from the coast they are inhabited by malayan pirates who seize on any vessels they can master especially the chinese and sell the crews and passengers for slaves it is not infrequent that they murder the whole crew their vessels are crowded with men armed either with lances and cresses or short daggers they suddenly board the ships they think they can master and having their native ferocity heightened by opium instantly stab all whom they find in their way these miscreants swarm in the streights of malacca and in all the islands which go under the name of malaye  patani patani  in lat    0 the next town of note lies close on the shore and was once greatly frequented by ships from surat the malabar coast and that of coromandel beside what come from china and other neighboring countries but the merchants finding no protection from the murderous pirates quite deserted the place this may have been the balonga of ptolemy  advancing still north gulf of siam we enter the gulf of siam the magnus sinus of the same geographer the land after passing patani makes a considerable curvature toward the west which continues as far as patanor in about lat  0 where it bends toward the northeast till it ends in the bottom of the gulf at the river of siam thus finishes the outline of this celebrated peninsula  in this curvature piperi near the bottom of the bay stood the ancient sipiberis the modern piperi and to the south of it sindu the present sini  we shall take a review of its whole extent from the northern end of its isthmus in lat      to its southern extremity at cape romano which is about six hundred and sixty miles the breadth in the widest part is about two hundred miles from that part it gradually narrows till it ends nearly in a point at cape romano all the interior parts of the country are hilly the lower grounds toward the sea marshy and wooded  in respect to the general view of the peninsula its productions and the singular manners and government of the inhabitants it is impossible to give a more clear statement than in the words of m le poivre the author of the celebrated voyages dun philosophe we use the translation of      which is done in a style equally elegant with that of the original i will not injure it by abridgment but give the whole from p    to p    and afterward some explanatory remarks on certain parts and a brief account of the natural history collected from different materials in the articles of botany mineralogy and zoology there is so great agreement between the productions of the opposite sumatra and the peninsula that i shall except in a very few instances defer entering on those subjects till i arrive in that great island  i shall now return to m le poivre  beyond the kingdom of siam of the malayes says that most observant and judicious traveller is the peninsula of malacca a country formerly well peopled and consequently well cultivated this nation was once one of the greatest powers and made a very considerable figure on the theater of asia the sea was covered with their ships and they carried on a most extensive commerce their laws however were apparently very different from those which subsist among them at present from time to time they sent out numbers of colonies which one after another peopled the islands of sumatra java borneo the celebes or macassar the moluccas the phillippines and those innumerable islands of the archipelago which bound asia on the east and which occupy an extent of seven hundred leagues in longitude from east to west by about six hundred of latitude from north to south the inhabitants of all these islands those at least upon the coasts are the same people they speak almost the same language have the same laws the same manners  is it not somewhat singular that this nation whose possessions are so extensive should scarce be known in europe i shall endeavor to give you an idea of those laws and those manners you will from thence easily judge of their agriculture  travelers who make observations on the malais are astonished to find in the center of asia under the scorching climate of the line the laws the manners the customs and the prejudices of the ancient inhabitants of the north of europe the malais are governed by feudal laws that capricious system conceived for the defense of the liberty of a few against the tyranny of one whilst the multitude is subjected to slavery and oppression  a chief who has the title of king or sultan issues his commands to his great vassals who obey when they think proper these have inferior vassals who often act in the same manner with regard to them a small part of the nation live independent under the title of oramcai or noble and sell their services to those who pay them best whilst the body of the nation is composed of slaves and live in perpetual servitude  with these laws the malais are restless fond of navigation war plunder emigrations colonies desperate enterprises adventures and gallantry they talk incessantly of their honor and their bravery whilst they are universally considered by those with whom they have intercourse as the most treacherous ferocious people on the face of the globe and yet which appeared to me extremely singular they speak the softest language of asia that which the count de forbin has said in his memoirs of the ferocity of the macassars is exactly true and is the reigning characteristic of the whole malay nations more attached to the absurd laws of their pretended honor than to those of justice or humanity you always observe that amongst them the strong oppress and destroy the weak their treaties of peace and friendship never subsisting beyond that selfinterest which induced them to make them they are almost always armed and either at war amongst themselves or employed in pillaging their neighbors  this ferocity which the malais qualify under the name of courage is so well known to the european companies who have settlements in the indies that they have universally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their ships who may put into the malay islands from taking on board any seamen of that nation except in the greatest distress and then on no account to exceed two or three  it is nothing uncommon for a handful of these horrid savages suddenly to embark attack a vessel by surprise poignard in hand massacre the people and make themselves masters of her malay batteaus with twentyfive or thirty men have been known to board european ships of thirty or forty guns in order to take possession of them and murder with their poignards great part of the crew the malay history is full of such enterprises which mark the desperate ferocity of these barbarians  the malais who are not slaves go always armed they would think themselves disgraced if they went abroad without their poignards which they call crit the industry of this nation even surpasses itself in the fabric of this destructive weapon  as their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tumult they could never endure the long flowing habits which prevail amongst the other asiatics the habits of the malais are exactly adapted to their shapes and loaded with a multitude of buttons which fasten them close to their bodies in every part i relate these seemingly trifling observations in order to prove that in climates the most opposite the same laws produce similar manners customs and prejudices their effect is the same too with respect to agriculture  the lands possessed by the malais are in general of a superior quality nature seems to have taken pleasure in there assembling her most favorite productions they have not only those to be found in the territories of siam but a variety of others peculiar to these islands the country is covered with odoriferous woods such as the eagle or aloes wood the sandal and the cassia odorata a species of cinnamon you there breathe an air impregnated with the odors of innumerable flowers of the greatest fragrance of which there is a perpetual succession the year round the sweet flavor of which captivates the soul and inspires the most voluptuous sensations no traveller wandering over the plains of malacca but feels himself strongly impelled to wish his residence fixed in a place so luxuriant in allurements where nature triumphs without the assistance of art  the malay islands produce various kinds of dying woods particularly the sapan which is the same with the brazil wood there are also a number of gold mines which the inhabitants of sumatra and malacca call ophirs some of which those especially on the eastern coast are richer than those of brazil or peru there are likewise mines of fine copper mixed with gold which the inhabitants name tombage in the islands of sumatra and banca are mines of calin or sine tin and at succadana in the island of borneo is a mine of diamonds those islands enjoy also exclusively the rotin the sagow or bread palm tree the camphre and other precious aromatics which we know under the names of various spiceries  the sea too teems with abundance of excellent fish together with ambergris pearls and those delicate birds nests so much in request in china formed in the rocks with the spawn of fishes and the foam of the sea by a species of small sized swallow peculiar to those seas this is of such an exquisite substance and flavor that the chinese long purchased them for their weight in gold and still buy them at an excessive price  in the midst of all this luxuriance of nature the malay is miserable the culture of the lands abandoned to slaves is fallen into contempt these wretched laborers dragged incessantly from their rustic employments by then restless masters who delight in war and maritime enterprises have rarely time and never resolution to give the necessary attention to the laboring of their grounds their lands in general remain uncultivated and produce no kind of grain for the subsistence of the inhabitants  malacca abounds with quadrupeds especially with tigers and others of the most savage kind it is customary here and in pegu for the tyrants of the country to make banishment into the woods for a certain time a punishment the unhappy objects are sure of never returning they quickly become a prey to the tiger or if they chance to escape the fangs of that cruel animal fall victims to hunger or corroding fear  the only peculiar quadruped seems to be the civet described by m sonnerat vol ii     tab xci  civet animal an elegant species of the size of a common cat the ground color is a perlaceous gray darkest on the upper part of the body above the eyes is a line of four small spots on the hind part of the head commence three black bands ending on the shoulders another divides the belly lengthways on the reins are three which end at the tail on the sides and thighs are seven rows of round black spots sixtyone in number the tail is long and annulated with black and gray this animal inhabits the woods leaps from tree to tree and is extremely fierce it distills from the opening placed near the genitals a musky liquor which the malayes collect and pretend that it fortifies the stomach and excites the amorous passions for which last purpose it is bought and highly esteemed by the chinese  m sonnerat vol ii  0  gives a very apocryphal account of the wild men of malacca wild men who inhabit the woods and live in the trees if they see any one pass they instantly descend and devour him there is says he another kind less ferocious and which shun the society of their anthropophagous brethren these live on fruits are monogamous and never cohabit with their wives but when nature invites some even will enter into a sort of traffic with the malayes and deposit at the foot of their treehabitations the tin they collect on the mountains for which the natives leave fruits and any trifles they think acceptable to their secluded brethren their language is unknown m sonnerat says he saw one taken young in the service of a counselor of malacca i wish he had fallen to the lot of a scotch judge what a treasure would he have been to lord monboddo seriously m sonnerat must have collected some tales of the ourang outang possibly a native of this country as it is of the malayan archipelago  the malayes are a well made people but rather below says mr marsden the middle stature their limbs small well shaped and particularly slender at the wrists and ancles their complexions tawney their eyes large their noses flat probably by art their hair black shining and very long  there are a few birds that i mention birds because m sonnerat ascribes them to the peninsula yet all that are found here must also inhabit sumatra he gives us the description of the bluerumped perroquet of mr latham supp lxvi the fore head and rump are blue the predominant color of the rest of the plumage palegreen the inner coverts of the wings crimson  the shorttailed pie latham supp    sonnerat ii tab cx differs very little from that described in vol of the outlines of the globe  the routoul of malacca is a most curious species of crowned pigeon described by m

kingdom to make one exception to my design mangostan i must here mention the garcinia mangostana the most boasted fruit of the indies and which is found in the highest perfection in this peninsula the name mangostan is malayan it is a species confined to malacca and the malaye isles grows neither in hindoostan nor naturally in the molucca isles but is cultivated in amboina the tree does not attain any great height the fruit is of the size of a small apple of a round form and deep red wine color on the summit is a star of five or six rays squared at their ends at the bottom are four hollow leaves the remains of the calyx the inside is purple and like a furrowed globe divided into segments each containing a kernel these segments are full of juice the most delicious that can be imagined a fine mixture of tart and sweet and so wholesome as to be allowed in any quantities to feverous patients this valuable tree is described by bontius p     of his historia naturalis ind orient who ushers in his description with these lines j b bontius l   c    cedant hesperii long hinc mala aurea fructus ambrosia pascit mangostam et nectare divos   laurence garcin a physician first gave a scientifical account of it and was honored by linnaeus in having his name given to the genus a full translation of garcins description with the plate is published in vol viii p     of martyns abridgment of our transactions in the herbarium amboinense vol i p      is a very good description and in plate xliii an excellent figure of the same tree every voyager who has visited the places of the growth of this delicious fruit is full of its paises  i now return to the coast upper siam the kingdom of siam recommences on this side near sangora exactly opposite to its limits on the bay of bengal the town stands on a large river and has some commerce in tin ivory aloewood and coarse gold ligore about twelve leagues to the north ligore is a very commercial town and its neighborhood produces abundance of tin and of elephants teeth it is seated a few miles up the river and built of bamboo thatched with reeds the pagodas have lofty steeples in form of pyramids the dutch have or had here a factory their houses stand a league within the mouth of the river and are built with brick the road for shipping is two leagues at sea  the whole eastern side of siam is low steep and rocky but inland rises into lofty mountains toward the bottom of the gulf the land approximates and the contracted part is called the bay of siam its entrance is by the mounts of pensels or pentens impending over the water on the western shore and the high cape siam on the opposite the last may be seen from the bar of siam or the meinam river twentytwo leagues distant  about four hundred and eight miles from ligore following the curvature of the gulf at the very bottom of the bay of siam river meinam is the mouth of the great river meinam the serus of ptolemy and the most consequential in the kingdom the road for shipping extends for the space of three leagues in which all sorts of vessels may safely ride such was the case when that learned traveller koempfer visited the place in    0 the country on both sides the river is marshy composed of the mud brought down in the annual floods this river like the ganges being subject to periodical inundations koempfer informs us that the name manam or meinam in the siamese language signifies the mother of humidities from its abundance of water which so greatly fertilizes the country it is deep rapid and broader than the elbe the upper part is rocky violent and interrupted by cataracts the lower divided into several channels passes through a very level country to the sea the banks of the river are covered with trees animated by monkies numbers of villages may be seen on both sides the houses generally stand i may say upon stilts or lofty posts so that the water during the inundations may pass without incommoding the occupiers near the city of judia many of the villages consist of inhabited ships or floating habitations these occasionally move from place to place when the waters are high the inmates keep a sort of fair and dispose of their various commodities  the meinam rises at a considerable distance to the north in the very extremity of the kingdom possibly far beyond for its fountains seem never to have been traced and the best accounts are very uncertain its course as far as we know runs due north and south  juthia or judia the capital of siam is seated in about lat city of juthia     0 on a low island in the form of a mans foot it is surrounded with a lofty brick wall the streets are strait and accommodated with canals which pass quite through from east to west as mr caverhill very reasonably fixes the zaba of ptolemy to have been in the bottom of the bay of siam i see no reason against supposing that it might have been either at juthia or at some place not remote from that port ships may enter into many of the canals and discharge their cargo near the principal houses the greater part of the streets are very mean built with bamboo covered with the leaves of palms those of the chinese hindoos and moors are of stone but very low the finest houses in koempfers time were such which had been inhabited by the english dutch and french history of phaulkon the palace of the unfortunate phaulkon minister of state in the last century makes the most conspicuous figure phaulkon was a grecian by birth and seaman by profession he had served various nations but chiefly the english in their service in capacity of a cockswain he came to siam and obtained an employment at court he was a man of very fine natural abilities and by his good conduct and his success in the management of affairs rose to the highest dignities and became prime minister to the reigning prince  his ambition proved his ruin and brought him to a violent death by the hands of the executioner he became so intoxicated with power as to entertain a design upon the throne to depose his royal master and to place over the siamese monpi totfo soninlaw to the monarch a phantom of a king who was to be dependent on his will and to be deposed as soon as affairs came to a crisis the king was at that time extremely ill of a dropsy on his decease the whole royal lineage was to be put to death and phaulkon usurp the power  in order to accomplish his designs it was necessary to call in foreign aid he persuaded his weak master to send an embassy to louis xiv to request his most christian majesty to send persons qualified to instruct in the arts his unpolished subjects so that he might shine preeminent among the eastern nations the first who set out in    0 were shipwrecked the second arrived safe in      the vanity of louis made him receive with every mark of respect these grotesque legates the memory of their reception is preserved in a medal histoire de medailles tab ccxvi  the king is represented seated on his throne the ambassadors making their obeisance above his majesty is inscribed fama virtutis intimating that the fame of his high qualities had induced them to come from this distant country louis in compliance with the wish of the embassy sent jesuits artists and military officers general de fargues landed with several hundred soldiers and was put into possession of bankok the key of the kingdom seated on the river between the capital and the sea just as every thing was ready for execution in may      the plot was discovered monpi was seized by the kings son and his head cast at phaulkons feet the minister thus hurled from his greatness was tortured and almost starved to death then carried out of town and beheaded his body cut in two and covered with a little earth was soon devoured by the dogs a sad proof how ambitio male suada ruit  the kingdom of siam is divided from north to south by a long range of lofty mountains on the west side account of siam or next to the bay of bengal the country is visited by continual rains during the time the monsoons blow from that quarter on the eastern side no such deluges are known nor any floods but what are the effects of the moderate inundations of the meinam which fertilize the country beyond description fertility the useful grain rice is produced in amazing crops and every delicate fruit of the indies without cultivation raynal mentions among the productions of siam logwood like that cut in campeachy it is a terrestrial paradise but loses all its advantages by groaning under the most despotic government on earth the monarch rules within his seraglio and his grandees are let loose to oppress the wretched commonalty according to their caprice and unrestrained will dominions thus governed stretch near a thousand miles from north to south or from lat  0    to lat   0 and in the broadest part extend three hundred and sixty  the religion of the country is the same with that inculcated by the bramins religion but the bramins of siam are not a peculiar race like those of hindoostan here every one who chooses assumes the priesthood they usually lead a monastic life and have their convents those of each province are governed by a sort of bishop nuns or female monastics are frequent the pagodas are of various forms some have a great resemblance to the chinese architecture the idols are monstrous in their appearance  the first knowledge of the christian religion was received by the mission of jesuits missionaries led here under the conduct of alexander of rhodes some time before the year      when pope alexander vii sent over a reinforcement of religious men but these being of other orders were treated by the jesuits with the utmost indignity nor would they condescend to permit them to share in their labors which had been attended with prodigious success as to the message louis xiv sent by his ambassador mr chaumont in      modestly requesting his siamese majesty to become a good catholic he received this very proper reply that he left it to his most christian majesty to judge whether a change of a religion that had been followed in his dominions without interruption during two thousand two hundred and twentynine years could be a matter of small importance to him or a demand with which it was easy to comply and a matter which related entirely to god and not to him this well might check the zeal of the missionaries but in the next reign on the discovery of the treachery of the french general and the murder of phaulkon the whole troop of the religious were sent away and all hopes of return entirely overthrown  in many respects the siamese have an agreement with the chinese we must except their bodies which are small in their headdress they agree in the pointed bonnet in the frequent inhabiting of ships and boats and now and then in their ornamented architecture the faces of the inhabitants are large form of the siamese their cheek bones prominent their foreheads and chins contract equally to a point their cheeks hollow their eyes small and oblique nose short and rounded their ears long by artificial distension their complexions swarthy their hair black and coarse and would be extremely long but that it is cut so very close that their heads seem beset with bristles their teeth black from art  it is to be lamented that so well informed a traveller as koempfer should not have left us any thing on the subject of the natural history of so fertile a kingdom we have nothing to say of its vegetable productions and as to its animals we can only inform our readers that it swarms with elephants elephants and that their teeth are a considerable article of commerce in this tyrannous government they are quite a pest these and other herbivorous beasts destroy the labors of the husbandmen and none dare repel the attacks of those ravagers elephants are here only reserved for state the king keeps great numbers and often makes them the instrument of his cruelty they are the executioners of his wrath on his offending subjects and are instructed how to put them to various kinds of death either by trampling them under their broad feet or deliberately tearing their limbs off with their lithe proboscis or flinging them up into the air and catching them empaled on their great tusks  buffaloes and deer are found here in vast numbers deer their skins constitute a great article of commerce fifty thousand of them have annually been sent to japan through the medium of the dutch mandelslo a most intelligent traveller gives the following account of the trade of siam as it was in the year      speaking of the city of juthia he says the principal commerce consists in stuffs brought from suratta and the coast of coromandel all sorts of chinese commodities precious stones gold benjamin wax copper lead indico calambawood brazilwood sapphires rubies etc but above all deer skins whereof they furnish the japanese with about fifty thousand every year it likewise yields a great trade of rice which they transport to all the neighboring isles  to this we may add the more modern account of the rich productions of this kingdom other productions taken from mr dalrymples repertory p      the productions of this country are prodigious quantities of grain cotton benjamin sandal agualo and sapan woods antimony tin lead iron loadstones gold and silver sapphires emeralds agates crystal marble and tambanck  hogs and wild swine swarm in the dominions of siam most of the savage beasts of india are equally numerous in this kingdom koempfer speaks of two species of monkies one very large and black the other smaller and of a gray color the first seems a kind not well ascertained for the only black monkey of the old world we are acquainted with is that described by mr edwards tab     which is no larger than a cat  after doubling cape liant river of liant a bay opens to the north and at the bottom receives the river of liant a vast chain of mountains which run from north to south and unite with those of china in lat    0 divide the kingdom of siam from the kingdoms of laos and cambodia and almost reach the sea near the river of liant the upper part of this tract is in laos the more southern forms the kingdom of cambodia which is compared to a vast valley bounded by the siamese chain to the west and that of cochinchina to the east the coast takes a southeastern direction from the bay of liant as far as cape cambodia a space of three hundred miles skirted by numbers of small isles washed by the bay of siam from the point of liant is a sandy barren desert reaching according to hamilton as far as ponteamas above twothirds of the coast  this extensive tract has great scarcity of ports ponteamas the most distinguished is that of ponteamas in lat  0    m le poivre gives so enchanting a picture of this colony that i will no more risque injuring it by the abridgment than i did his history of the malayes his descriptions are so exquisite that i must hope that they will not fall under a too frequent imputation on the writers of his lively nation of being plus beau que la verite  departing says m le poivre from the peninsula of malacca and the islands of the malais toward the north i fell in with a small territory called cancar but known on the maritime charts under the name of ponthiamas surrounded by the kingdom of siam where despotism and depopulation go hand in hand the dominions of camboya where no idea of established government subsists and the territories of the malais whose genius perpetually agitated by their feudal laws can endure peace neither at home nor abroad this charming country about fifty years ago was uncultivated and almost destitute of inhabitants  a chinese merchant commander of a vessel which he employed in commerce frequented these coasts being a man of that intelligent reflective genius which so characteristically marks his nation he could not without pain behold immense tracts of ground condemned to sterility though naturally more fertile than those which formed the riches of his own country he formed therefore a plan for their improvement with this view having first of all hired a number of laborers some chinese others from the neighboring nations he with great address insinuated himself into the favor of the most powerful princes who for a certain subsidy assigned him a guard for his protection  in the course of his voyage to batavia and the philippine islands he borrowed from the europeans their most useful discoveries and improvements particularly the art of fortification and defense with regard to internal police he gave the preference to the chinese the profits of his commerce soon enabled him to raise ramparts sink ditches and provide artillery these preliminary precautions secured him from a coup de main and protected him from the enterprises of the surrounding nations of barbarians  he distributed the lands to his laborers without the least reservation of any of those duties or taxes known by the names of service or fines of alienation duties which by allowing no real property become the most fatal scourge to agriculture and is an idea which revolts against the common sense of every wise nation he provided his colonists at the same time with all sorts of instruments proper for the labor and improvement of their grounds  in forming a laboring and commercial people he thought that no laws ought to be framed but those which nature has established for the human race in every climate he made these laws respected by obeying them first himself and exhibiting an example of simplicity industry frugality humanity and good faith he formed then no system of laws  he did more  he established morals  his territories soon became the country of every industrious man who wished to settle there his port was open to all nations the woods were cleared the grounds judiciously labored and sown with rice canals cut from the rivers watered their fields and plentiful harvests after supplying them with subsistence furnished an object of extensive commerce his integrity his moderation and his humanity made him respected he never wished to reign but only to establish the empire of reason his son who now fills his place inherits his virtues as well as his possessions by agriculture and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands he has become so powerful that the barbarians his neighbors style him king a title which he despises he pretends to no right of sovereignty but the noblest of all that of doing good happy in being the first laborer and the first merchant of his country he merits as well as his father a title more glorious than that of king  the friend of mankind  the barbarians of the neighborhood amazed to see abundance so suddenly succeed to sterility flocked for subsistence to the magazines of ponthiamas whose dominions at this day are considered as the most plentiful granary of that eastern part of asia the malais the cochin chinese the siamese whose countries are naturally so fertile considering this little territory as the most certain resource against famine  let me here add that our plain hamilton who visited ponteamas in    0 found the town in ruins it had been taken and plundered in the year      by the siamese fleet at which time it was a place of considerable trade it may have recovered by the time m le poivre was there so as to vindicate his enthusiastic account the town is seated on a deep but narrow river which in the season of inundations communicates with that of meinam kom cambodia or cambodia and the city of the same name on its banks by which means the commodities of the kingdom are sent to this port in preference to that at the mouth of the cambodia which is said to be of very troublesome navigation by reason of the numbers of low islands and sand banks which obstruct the channel  it is highly probable that such was the state of this river from the very early times we find no ancient port at this place but learn from ptolemy cattigara that one called cattigara sinarum statio stood on or near the site of ponteamas on a marshy coast productive of reeds bamboos so large that when they were joined and tied together passengers were enabled to cross from one side to the other  marcianus heracleota who wrote not long before the building of constantinople adds besides that it stood on the river cotiaris and was the termination of the known and habitable earth to the south the periplus of this geographer may be found in the first volume of the geographiae veteris scriptores published at oxford in school  the notium promontorium notium promont was to the northwest of ponteamas the bay mentioned by marcianus heracleota to be so infested by wild beasts and the part inhabited by the ethiopian icthyophagi extended from that port to the south cape cambodia seems the satyrorum promontorium probably because it was the haunt of some large species of monkey  the productions of the kingdom of cambodia are gold and ivory in great abundance productions of cambodia the siamese in their expedition of      destroyed not less than two hundred tons that happened to be in the port ready for exportation sandal wood sapan wood aloes wood stick lac and a great variety of drugs dampier voy vol ii p  0  adds rice dragons blood lac i e varnish in large jars which looked blackish and thick and a yellow purging gum in great cakes called cambodia by which he certainly means gamboge the whole country is prodigiously fertile and yields almost every thing that the vegetable or animal kingdom produces in common with other parts of eastern india  the portuguese says mandelslo were in possession of the commerce of cambodia as late as the year      notwithstanding every effort of the dutch to come in for a share but it must have been long enjoyed by the latter nation after the fall of the portuguese empire in india the reigning prince in    0 seemed very solicitous that the english should settle in his dominions and offered to permit us to form factories and build forts to protect our trade mr bowyear hereafter to be mentioned says that the cambodians resemble the malays whose language is generally understood in all these parts  about two hundred topasses or indian portuguese were settled and married in the capital of cambodia when hamilton was there and seemed the only remains of that people they all have small pensions from the king of the country but in order to support themselves are obliged to take to the chase of elephants which they shoot for the sake of their teeth with iron slugs poisoned by immersion in the thick bark of a certain tree the beast is sure to fall in a short time after receiving its wound the same method is used in killing the buffaloes on account of their tongues  from cape cambodia the country bends due east the river of the same name discharges itself into the sea at the distance of about one hundred miles city through several mouths the city stands ninety miles up the river and consists of only one street which is built on an eminence to preserve it from the annual inundations the rains begin to fall in june and continue during the months of july and august  this was near the site of thina metropolis sinarum of ptolemy and marcianus mr caverhill quotes argensol for the proof and says on his authority that marble ruins of an extensive city have been discovered to the northwest of cambodia yet ptolemy relates that it was not surrounded with brazen walls nor had any thing worth mentioning arrian in his periplus maris erythraei calls it the greatest of the inland cities and that it sent to barygaza the modern barochia on the western side of hindoostan wool thread and othonium sericum outlines of the globe vol i p      these were carried the whole of the journey by men on foot prodigious must it have been if it is true that they went through bactra a detour of amazing extent  the kingdom of cambodia was known to the arabs by the name of rachmi rachmi it was visited in the ninth century by two arabian travelers who report that the finest muslins in the world were made there and that the natives wore garments so fine that they might be drawn through a middle sized ring the same writers speak wonderful things of the karkandan or unicorn but from the whole description it is evident that they mean no other animal than our onehorned rinoceros  let me conclude the account of the kingdom with saying the ancient thinae and sinae that the ancients comprehended under the name of thinae and sinae not only cambodia but also pegu siam laos cochinchina and the more southern parts of china of which thina was the common capital  the noted island of pulo condore lies about fifteen leagues to the south of the western channel of the cambodia it is situated in lat    0 its form is that of a crescent the length not above eight miles the greatest breadth about two the whole is lofty and mountanous and surrounded by lesser isles the name is derived from pulo an isle and condore a calabash from its production of that fruit it is mentioned by a captain saris an englishman who sailed by it in   0  in his way from japan the harbor is between the greater island and a lesser called the little condore lying off the north end in which is sufficient depth of water and safe anchorage dampier voy     in      careened and refitted his ship here and has given us a good account of many particulars he says that the soil is rich and black the hills craggy the eastern part of the island sandy but clothed with trees of various kinds some of the shores are rocky others low and sandy all the islands are finely watered with small rivulets during ten months of the year which begin to fail toward the latter end of march in the dry season but on digging water may be found in many places  the vegetabled observed by dampier dampier vol i p     were mangoes in a state of nature the areca oleracea or cabbage palm the coco palm wild nutmegs grape trees and a large tree four feet in diameter which on incision yields a clammy juice that being boiled proves an excellent tar and on farther boiling becomes hard as pitch dammer pitch this probably is the dammer ibid vol i p     captain gore in cooks last voyage voy iii      adds to the list of plants water melons potatoes gourds plantains oranges shaddocks pomegranates rice and black beans these possibly were acquisitions since the days of dampier and introduced by the french who humanely and politically wished to render these islands useful to navigators in their way to or from japan china manilla tonquin cochinchina and many parts of india with which the europeans have intercourse at the time captain gore visited this island a mandarine from saigore came here with a certificate in french from the bishop of adran a frenchman certifying that he was sent in order to give his assistance to any european ship which might touch at this port dampier recommended the erection of a fort and mentions among other advantages that ships might in this island be supplied with masts and yards possibly from the same tree which furnishes the tar and pitch  the animals when dampier resided on the island animals were only hogs lizards and guanoes before captain gore reached pulo condore it was plentifully stocked with buffaloes transported from the continent which increase here very successfully numbers of monkies inhabit the woods and two species of squirrels one of a beautiful shining black the other of the kind called flying striped brown and white and probably a new species gaubil also observed rats with pendulous ears to the reptiles we add that father gaubil saw here in      the flying dragon or dracovolans a scaly species of lizard called koka from its piercing note resembling in sound that word it resides in hollow trees its bite is mortal from these circumstances i suspect it to be the gekko  here are a variety of parrots paroquets and pigeons and in the woods numbers of poultry in a state of nature i refer the reader for a further account to page     vol ii of the outlines of the globe the thrush called by mr latham vol ii p    the longtailed may be added to the list of birds  dampier found on the shores great plenty of the green turtle tortoises these he supposes to have been in a state of migration being of opinion that for want of food it is impossible for them to stay the whole year in the neighboring seas our great navigator found them here from the   th of march to the   st of april the natives of this island took them in large nets and boiled the fat for the sake of the oil  the inhabitants of pulo condore supposed to be originally of cochinchina are small in stature of dark complexion long visaged with black and lank hair white teeth thin lips small eyes high noses their religion is idolatrous they worship chiefly the elephant and the horse similar to the objects of adoration in tonquin  in   0  allan ketchpole english settlement director of the english east india company at chusan on the desertion of that settlement made an attempt to form one here he engaged in his service a number of macassars who were to act as soldiers to assist in building and to serve during three years at the end of the term he basely refused to fulfill his contract those islanders remarkable for the fidelity with which they execute all their agreements are as determined to revenge any injuries offered to them in the night they put to death ketchpole and most of the english a few on the first alarm escaped in a boat the macassars regained their liberty and inflicted a most justifiable punishment on their persidious master  here dampiers crew was welcomed by the people coming on board and offering the free use of their women during their stay this is a practice in pegu siam and other places in the parts of india cis gangem prior in his alma is very humorous on this subject in the second canto in china dampiers travels tell ye look in his index for pagelli soon as the british ships unmoor and jolly long boats row to shore down come the nobles of the land each brings his daughter in his hand beseeching the imperious tar to make her but one hour his care the tender mother stands affrighted lest her dear daughter should be slighted and poor miss yaya dreads the shame of going back the maid she came   on returning to the estuaries of the river of cambodia ciampa after a short journey eastward we reach the small territory of ciampa or bink thoan which extends about a hundred and fifty miles along the shore the breadth does not exceed ninety the aboriginal people called loyes are large muscular and well made loves a people their complexions tinged with red their noses somewhat flatted their hair long and black they have small whiskers but scarcely any beards their dress a shirt and breeches of cotton the last covered with a sort of petticoat of white cloth fringed with silk according to the circumstance of the wearer they are governed by a monarch who resides at feneri the capital of the country in a mean palace and with little state he is in fact a tributary to the king of cochinchina who sends a mandarine to reside at the court as president of the council and without his advice nothing of moment is done the productions of the country are very few some cotton indigo and bad silk for which they traffic with the chinese they are inferior to the cochinchinese in their military but excel them in naval affairs their ships or jonks are tolerably well built they are chiefly employed in fisheries which are very considerable and form their chief article of commerce the chinese send ships very frequently to the northern ports of the country laden with tea an inferior sort of silk porcellane and some other commodities of that empire they take in return gold and columba wood to be burnt on the tombs of their ancestors and relations or before the altars of their divinities  amidst the mountains inhabit a race of people named moyes moyes who go naked excepting a cloth which is wrapped round their middle they are employed in hard labor and are little better than slaves both the loyes and moyes are regulated by the same laws the government is very oppressive they are punished for the least fault and among the common people that of showing any appearance of wealth is one of the first moment the only good in the system of government is the toleration of religion here is found a degenerated mahometanism the doctrine of confucius and idolatry in all the variety and extravagancy of image worship we know little of this country i am obliged to m mannevillette p     for my information which he got from the captain of la galathea a french frigate which put into one of the ports of ciamba in    0 and was detained there for some time  in      mr higginson president of fort st george formed the idea of opening a trade with ciampa and sent mr bowyear on a sort of embassy to the king of cochinchina at his court he met with the prince of this country who gave him every encouragement and told him he might by the river cambodia dispose of great quantities of woollencloth among the loyes  i may add here to my account of the river that at the mouth is never less than four fathoms of water and that it is navigable for ships of some burden up to the very capital above which small vessels only are used and the navigation is by report said to be interrupted by a cataract  according to danville cochinchina the kingdom of cochinchina unites with its tributary ciampa at the bay of comorin the original name is anam the portuguese bestowed on it the appellation it bears at present which by the help of the japanese word cochi signifies the country west of china in describing the form of this extensive stripe of empire i shall include in it its les pais conquis the whole beginning from the borders of cambodia is in form of a bow bending into the ocean as far as cape varelle in lat    0 when it inclines to its northern extremity in lat     0 the whole length of this great curvature is about six hundred and sixty miles the breadth not exceeding that we have given to ciampa the northern borders are defended by a wall which runs from the sea to the great chain of mountains and forbids all approach from that quarter as the inaccessible chain itself does every attempt of invasion from their western neighbors the moyes who inhabit these mountains are said to be a most savage and ferocious race  the court of cochinchina is usually held at sinoa a little to the south of the wall there says mr bowyear the king in his tongtan or eighth moon takes his recreation with his mandarines and forbids all interruption by petitions or any sort of business  all the lower part of the kingdom has its annual inundations inundated like the other tropical countries which give it prodigious fertility borris account of the peculiarity of the floods in this kingdom is very curious the rains on the mountains during the wet season are intermittent they happen once a fortnight and last three days at a time bringing fertility and plenty to the subjacent country this rain is called lut its arrival is celebrated by every one from the king to the peasant with the utmost festivity the overflowing of the nile is not received in egypt with greater rapture the seasons in cochinchina may be called four the violent heats last during may june and july the rains fall in september october and november and ab ae the violence of the sun in december january and february the cold northern winds prevale accompanied by cooling showers in march april and may all the beauties of spring appear and the fruits of every kind of vegetation bless the country  the great harvest is that of rice rice two species are cultivated on the mountanous and dry soils one as white as snow and when dressed of a slimy viscous nature made into pastes such as vermicelli and the like both these kinds are exported to china in great quantities the different sorts of rice are the staples of this country  the sugarcane is another plant to which the cochinchinese pay the utmost attention sugar and cultivate in vast abundance they are acquainted with most of the processes and annually manufacture great quantities of both white and brown sugars so that their country supplies china with the principal part of this article that vast empire not producing sufficient for its own consumption the city of faifo or foy foe is the emporium from which the chinese annually export about forty thousand barrels each weighing above two thousand pounds to the credit of these orientalists all the cultivation and all the posterior processes in the production of the sugar is the voluntary labor of freemen  to these articles of commerce may be added woods of different kinds such as aloes wood or agollocha agollocha erroneously called eaglewood columba and others of value either in mechanics or for their sweet scent columba woods the price of columba wood on the very spot is five ducats a pound at the ports sixteen and in japan to which much is exported two hundred a pillow of this wood is the highest luxury with the orientalists particularly the japanese who will give three or four hundred ducats per pound for a piece big enough for that purpose the agollocha bears a good price great quantities being shipped for hindoostan for the use of the hindoos to burn their dead who seem to emulate the ancient romans in the aromatic profusion of their funeral piles  pepper grows here in abundance pepper le poivre and raynal mention that cinnamon superior to that of ceylon is found on a certain mountain for which the chinese pay a higher price than for that brought from the famous staple of that spice cassia is another spice let me question whether the two are not confounded  cotton is much cultivated as is the mulberry tree cotton for the use of the silkworms great quantities of coarse silks are made here some so strong as to serve for sails and cordage but the finest sorts also are manufactured the imposing chinese export from hence the fibers of a tree called pitre which they fraudulently mix with their own manufactures they even import into their land of tea a course and black sort possibly for the sake of enabling them to export their own at greater profit into our island the mountains yield some gold and much iron the natives fuse the last and employ the metal in various manufactories raw and wrought silk may be added to the articles of commerce  the portuguese had once considerable influence in the court of cochinchina the dutch made a strong effort to come in for a share of the commercial emoluments but were expelled the kingdom by the superior interest of their rivals at present it is said that the trade is chiefly in the hands of the japanese and chinese who are settled at foy foe and preserve their own laws religion and customs the harbors are still casually frequented by european ships but i think their imports inconsiderable  the chief port is that of foy foe port of foy foe some miles up a navigable river the entrance has before it at a little distance the isles of champellos the channel between the mouths and the town is filled with islands and obstructed by a bar but not unsurmountable ships of some burden formerly have been brought over and then were obliged to anchor before the customhouse which was the case with mr bowyear the town consists but of two rows of houses inhabited by chinese and a few japanese the first of whom manage the trade and import various articles from canton siam camboja batavia and manilla bowyear met with encouragement to settle a factory near the city but i believe it never was carried into effect  this country is certainly very favorable to trade and navigation having not fewer than sixty safe harbors and a great depth of water in every part  the galleys or shipping of the cochinchinese are very numerous shipping part allotted to the defense of the coast are finely painted and highly varnished rowed with fifty oars and carry a cannon at the head and two small ones on each side notwithstanding the cochinchinese can neither cast cannon or make fusils their dexterity says mr borri churchills col vl ii  0   in the art of gunnery is amazing not one of our europeans dare enter the list with them the navy of this country is quickly manned every family being bound to furnish a sailor who serves with great alacrity for they are well treated and their wives and children supported during their absence all are dressed in an uniform and when they are about to engage put on a gilt helmet and a cloak which leaves their right arm quite bare numbers of their vessels are employed in the fisheries the fish are found in vast abundance and form a great article of commerce fish and rice constitute the principal food of the cochinchinese  the woods and mountains afford all the variety of birds and quadrupeds of the adjacent kingdoms elephants tigers swarm elephants are in great abundance and of vast size these are taken and reclamed numbers are kept in the royal stables merely for ostentation being no longer used in war they are rendered of infinite service to the inhabitants of the country as beasts of burden the carriers both by land and water i may say the stage coaches and ferries of cochinchina on their backs is placed a machine like the body of a coach reckoning the outside as well as inside they convey thirteen or fourteen passengers when they arrive at a river they take the water very readily and will even carry their fare in perfect safety over an arm of the sea a mile wide  a great monkey called here the douc monkey by me the cochinchina hist quad ii no     is found of the length of four feet exclusive of the tail the tail and lower parts of the arms are pure white the crown upper parts of the arms and thighs black buttocks clothed with hair round the neck a collar of purplish brown the face bordered up to the eyes with a great yellowish beard it is also found in madagascar where it is called sifac it walks often erect its food beans  i beg not to be understood to favor the doctrine of some systemmakers by connecting the description of the monkey of cochinchina with that of the man i readily allow changelings or artificial monkies among our species but none that are natural we have also our bears as to the men of this country they greatly resemble the chinese from whom they are distantly sprung they are featured exactly like them but are less in body more active and more valiant the complexion of those on the coast is olive that of the inland or alpine inhabitants is fairer and not inferior to that of europeans  it is this country that produces in such quantities the edible birds nests held by the epicure of the east to be the first of delicacies it is chiefly made use of in soups and ragouts of chickens the nests are first softened in water pulled to pieces and mixed with ginseng put into the body of the fowl the above is then to be stewed in a pot with a sufficient quantity of water and left on the coals the whole night the best kinds which are white and quite pure from dirt are dissolved in broths in order to thicken them and to give them that flavor the orientalists so much admire of the black and foul nests is made glue  mr latham vol ii     gives the following account it weighs about half an ounce and is in shape like half a lemon or as some compare it to that of a saucer with one side flatted where it adheres to the rock the texture of it is somewhat like isinglass or rather more like fine gumdragon and the several layers of the matter it is composed of very apparent being fabricated from repeated parcels of a soft slimy substance in the same manner as the martins form theirs of mud authors differ much as to the materials of which it is composed some suppose it to consist of seaworms of the mollusca class others of the seaqualm a kind of cuttle fish or a glutinous seaplant called agal agal it has also been supposed that they rob other birds of their eggs and after breaking the shells apply the white of them for that purpose  these nests are found in vast numbers in certain caverns in various isles in the soolo archipelago situated between longitude     and   0 lat   and   particularly in three small isles or rather rocks in the caverns of which the nests are found fixed to the sides in astonishing numbers they are also found in amazing quantities on a small island called toc in the streights of sunda the caverns of which are lined with the nests but no where in greater abundance than about croee near the south end of sumatra four miles up a river of that name but they are not peculiar to the above places for they are likewise common from java to cochinchina on the north and from the point of sumatra west where it is called layung to new guinea on the east where the sea is said to be covered with a viscous substance like half melted glue which the bird is supposed either to take up from the surface with its bill during flight or to pick it from the rocks when left there by the waves  the best nests or those of a pure white and free from mixture sell in china from  000 to   00 dollars the picle the black and dirty ones for only twenty dollars the last are supposed to arise from age mixed with dirt or feathers and the gatherers beat down all the black ones they can get at in hopes that from the necessity of the birds making fresh nests they may meet with the more valuable ones at the next gathering it is said that the dutch alone export from batavia  000 picles of these nests every year which are brought from the isles of cochinchina and those lying to the east of them among our east india imports it is much to be wondered that among other luxuries imported by us from the east the use of these nests should not have found a way to our tables as yet being so scarce in england as to be kept as rarities in the cabinets of collectors  the king resides generally at whay whay the kings court in lat       north about twentyfive miles from the sea on a river navigable for vessels of fifty or sixty tons up to the city but the bar has on it at low water only four feet the city is extensive the palace a large square the streets near it wide long and regular the rest of the city consists of straggling houses several branches of the river meet here every family keeps its covered boat and there are numbers besides kept for hire for most of the conveyance is by water it is a place of great trade both from kankao and all parts of their own coasts  the celebrated m le poivre was here in      and appeared at court with great splendour oriental repertory      bearing a letter from the king of france and some very paltry gifts for the cochinchinese monarch le poivre was too open and boasted so much of his grand monarque that his veracity was called in question and in the end he and his countrymen forced to make a hasty retreat  the government of cochinchina is monarchical government of cochinchina it had once been a province to tonquin but was separated from it in the beginning of the last century the story is differently related i refer the reader to hamiltons account vol ii     of the cause and manner le poivre relates it differently yet both may be right in the chief circumstances of the event the ruling religion is that of the chinese not the pure and primaeval worship of the shangti the patriarchal religion but that of china in its corrupted state christianity introduced by the portuguese during the time of their favor at the court of cochinchina got ground for some little time missionaries were sent churches erected and multitudes of converts made at length a king arose unfriendly to our doctrine who expelled the missionaries and compelled his subjects to return within the pale of the national church having premised this i shall treat the reader with le poivres elegant account of the revolution and the happy state of this kingdom but i must mix my fears with it that as he hints at corruptions creeping fast into the original system of government it may be found at present as absolute as tyrannical and as absurd as other eastern dominions under the rule of the infirm individual to begin  a tonquinese prince unsuccessful in a war he carried on against the king of tonquin under whom he enjoyed an office somewhat resembling the maires de palais under the merovingian race of the kings of france retired with his soldiers and adherents across the river which divides that kingdom from cochinchina the savages who then possessed this country fled before these strangers and took refuge among the mountains of tsiampa after a long war with their old enemies who pursued them the tonquinese fugitives remained at length peaceable possessors of the country known under the name of cochinchina it extends about two hundred leagues from north to south but narrow and unequal from east to west they then applied themselves entirely to the cultivation of rice which being the ordinary food of the inhabitants of asia is to them an object of the greatest importance they separated into little cantonments and established themselves on the plains which extend along the banks of the rivers  the six first kings founders of this monarchy governed the nation as a father governs his family they established the laws of nature alone they themselves paid the first obedience to them chiefs of an immense family of laborers they gave the first example of labor they honored and encouraged agriculture as the most useful and honorable employment of mankind they required from their subjects only a small annual freegift to defray the expense of their defensive war against their tonquinese enemies  off the coast of cochinchina are the paracels the paracels a vast tract of rocks reefs sandbanks and small isles extending from north to south from lat     0 n to       n two hundred and seventysix miles in length and sixty in breadth to the northeast of the northern end is a group of small reefs and rocks called the triangles and again a little to the southeast of that is a great irregularly shaped shoal called the macclesfield shoal between these and the isle of hainan belonging to china is clear and deep water that island lies to the north about one hundred and thirty miles from the nearest extremity of the paracels the interval is the common passage of our ships bound for china they sail between the coast of cochinchina and the paracels till they get sight of the campellos isles in lat     0 from thence they cross over toward hainan which is strongly marked by several very high and craggy mountains foresights of the general nature of the great empire  tinhosa is the next point navigators make for a small but lofty isle not remote from hainan and from thence is a direct and clear course to the islands of sanciam a little beyond which is that of macao and the numerous isles that bound the channels to the great port of canton  the bay of tonquin begins near the wall of cochinchina bay of tonquin and at the northern extremity of that kingdom the entrance is bounded on the eastern side by the island of hainan the middle of the bay has very deep water and is free from isles excepting a small one called the nachtigael but the shores are skirted with sands or groups of little isles the coasts themselves according to dampier very low and the whole interior a flat of the richest soil productive of all the fruits and possibly vegetables of the tropics pastures or rice ground border the banks of the most considerable rivers  the great orange camchain has a thick rind and rough fruits the inside of an amber color the smell is most fragrant the taste most delicious  the camquit is very small round and of a deep red the taste is equal to the former but is esteemed a more unwholesome fruit as it both creates and heightens the disorder of the flux the limes are equal in size to lemons the betel is said to surpass any of the indian  the mulberry is much cultivated here for the nourishment of the silkworms mulberry there is a succession of them for the leaves of the old trees are held to be less nutritive to the worm and productive of worse silk the species of morus is generally supposed to be the white  the rhus vernix is found here and in several other parts of india citra gangem rhus vernix it is the valuable tree which yields the varnish so useful in the lacquering of variety of things and giving them a sort of immortality the best is in japan the reader may satisfy his curiosity further by consulting thunberg flora japon p     koempfers travels i     and his amaen acad     fig     kalm vol i    found it in north america and mentions it under the name of the poison tree it certainly merits the title but its effects are not general some persons can receive its juice on the body or hands without the least ill consequence while others are afflicted with violent swelling acute pains and blisters so numerous that the patient will resemble a leper and his very skin peel off some people are even struck with blindness for two days together much depends on the constitutions of those affected there are men that will handle the tree or touch the juice with impunity while others will be visited with all the deleterious symptoms by being in the way of the smoke or even of the wind which carries the effluvia or exhalations of this singular tree  it has been observed that the workers in laquer or japan feel the bad effects being subject to violent eruptions in form of boils or blotches the laborers can only work in the dry season when the north winds blow they are obliged to lay several coats on each of which must have time to dry before the other is applied the varnish is brought to market in great tubs all the working season the natural color is white and thick like cream but changes in the air and becomes blackish dampier says that the tonquinese have the art of making of it a glue the best in the world  in this kingdom are abundance of sir and poon trees both which are very serviceable for masts the country also produces sappanwood sappan wood which dampier compares to the logwood of campeachy it proves to be the caju sappan or lignum sapan of rumphius iv    tab xxi ligno brasiliano simile bauhin pin     caesalpina sappan syst pl ii     loureiro fl loch   0 this tree grows principally in siam and ciamba is of the first use in india for the dying of red rumphius gives a very full account of the means by which it produces a tinge of different shades it is also brought to the european market it grows to a moderate size the branches are thick set with short spines the wood is very hard and much used by the indians for pegs to fasten the boards of their ships this plant has been introduced into the kew garden and is described by mr aiton hort kew ii    under the name of caesalpina vesicaria narrowleaved prickly brasiletto  the zoology of tonquin would give a most plentiful harvest here seems to be a continuation of most of the animals of the countries of india we have passed over elephants the elephants are generally in a state of nature they are very wild and shy but when taken their flesh is eagerly sought after the trunk is a peculiar dainty the king keeps a few for state when one happens to die the flesh is given to the poor and the trunk cut to pieces and sent to the mandarines horseflesh is also frequently brought to market this favors of tartarian origin  the variety of birds birds terrestrial and aquatic is incredible the water fowl pair before may and fly in pairs during the months of june and july from october to march they collect in vast flocks the tonquinese take them in nets set on poles which the birds strike on in the twilight  fish is in equal abundance soya sauce that delicate sauce we call soya is made here of one species and of a sort of shrimp is produced another relishing luxury called balichaun  the chief river of the country is called the river of tonquin which empties itself into the bay by two channels one called rokho the other twenty leagues to the northeast which dampier named that of domea the first frequented by the smaller vessels has not above twelve feet water at the entrance and is the most convenient for the siamese and chinese the other is used by the european ships on account of the depth before the mouth is a line of hard sand two miles long the entrance is distinguished by a high ridgy mountain far up the country called the elephant about six leagues from the mouth of the river is the village of domea usually consisting of a hundred houses yet on the arrival of the european ships it soon increases to a large town the natives resort for sake of trade from all parts houses suddenly spring up for being only constructed of frames of bamboo and the roof of palm or other leaves a temporary town is quickly formed in which a fair is kept as long as the ships remain in the harbor  the river is subject to the same periodical floods as others in the tropical regions and the same fertility is the consequence the wet season commences the latter end of april or beginning of may and lasts till toward the close of august the rains are intermittent some are of two or three days continuance others of only a few hours with intervals of fine weather especially toward the beginning and conclusion of the season during the wet months the heat is intolerable especially when the sun can force its rays through the thick clouds  the typhons typhons or as dampier calls them tuffoons are most tremendous in this bay and on the coast of china they prevale in the months of july august and september and commonly near the change of the moon they are preceded by very fine weather a presaging cloud appears in the northeast black near the horizon edged with copper color on the upper part fading into a glaring white it often exhibits a ghastly appearance twelve hours before the typhon bursts its rage lasts many hours from the northeast attended with dreadful claps of thunder large and frequent flashes of lightning and excessive hard rains then it sinks into a dead clam after which it begins again with redoubled rage from the southwest and continues an equal length of time  the great halley gives an account of the surprising tides in this bay tides each flux is of twelve hours duration and its reflux the same so that there occurs but one high water in twentyfour hours the great philosopher shall speak in his own words  on the first and second days at the waters increase the influxes are very small and uncertain but afterward the tides for thirteen days are constant in their course one flood and one ebbing being completed in twentyfour hours time equally sharing the space of a lunar circuition of the earth between them and every flood beginning nearest three quarters of an hour later than the precedent flood and also considerably increasing in the height of the tide every day from the third unto the sixth and seventh days of the waters age on which two days the flood runs very high but on the eighth day which may be accounted the last of the spring tides the waters begin gradually to decrease again retaining the same orderly difference of time in each tide until the next following first day of the waters increase when during two days unsettledness there is a shifting of the tides in respect of the beginning of the flood and ebb after which said shifting a constancy in their inverted course is again retained in the above mentioned order for thirteen days following  cachao the principal city of tonquin city of cachao lies about eighty miles higher up the river and is the place where the chief trade is carried on the imports are conveyed from the ships in large tonquinese boats navigated by the natives the tide runs with great rapidity thirty or forty miles above domea through a rich and beautiful plain near hean a town of two thousand houses is the place where the two channels meet and form the delta of tonquin about eighty miles from the sea the chinese merchants have a street to themselves at hean for a time they resided at cachao but became so numerous that they seemed to swallow up the very natives the king therefore ordered them to remove here the french also had a factory in this town in dampiers time is is from that honest voyager i take my account having no later authority of any authenticity the chinese and siamese jonks come up as high as the town and ride in the middle of the river  cachao is a city of twenty thousand houses the walls usually made of mud and thatch but some are of brick covered with tiles here are three regal places two very mean the third more magnificent but built of timber and open at the sides this with the courts fish ponds and docks for the pleasure boats take up a vast space of ground surrounded by a wall faced with brick there are several gates and stairs to ascend to the top of the walls round which is a pleasant walk this place is the residence or rather prison of the boua or emperor of tonquin in this country is a most singular government by a revolution which happened long ago the general of the reigning monarch made himself master of the empire he assumed all the regal power and seized the whole revenue but did not venture to extirpate the royal family for fear of the affection the people entertained for their ancient rulers the executive power is lodged in the general or his heirs who is called choua he is quite absolute has his guards and all the insignia of majesty the boua is kept as a state prisoner with his wives and children and diverts himself within the palace walls for he is never allowed to stir out the choua pays him all external respects visits him three times a year gives him the precedence makes him a tender of his life and services and declares that all he does is in kindness to save him the fatigues of government the choua places his own creatures about him and no others are permitted to have access  the english and dutch have or had factories in this city factories i am not well acquainted with the exports of the country they are said to be gold woods for dying raw and wrought silk some callicoes varnish turpentine salt earthen ware anniseed and drugs of several kinds pearls are also found on the coasts  the royal navy is an affair of state useless and contemptible in wars and as to ships of commerce there are scarcely any so that every thing is brought in and out of the kingdom in foreign bottoms  i may be pardoned for digressing to the healing art of the tonquinese tonquin medicine i must produce their receipt for the cure of the bite of the mad dog the gaol distemper and other maladies incident to human nature let the good intent apologize for the following extract thought worthy of a place in the eleventh volume p  0   of the philosophical transactions  they the tonquinese take of the best musk about gr xvi of the purest native cinnabar and finest vermillion each about gr xxiv and having reduced them separately to impalpable powders mix and administer them in about a gill of arrack which in two or three hours generally throws the patient into a sound sleep and perspiration if not they repeat the dose and think the cure certain  the religion of this country is the same with that of cochinchina religion but idolatry appears here with much less magnificence the pagodas are mean and their images numerous it should seem that the mandarines and better sort of people are more enlightened and confine themselves to the worship of one god they do not frequent the pagodas they have no idols but adore the supreme in their courts with uplifted eyes a person of the family reads the petition to heaven dampiers vol ii    account of the ceremony is curious when they make this petition says he they order a great deal of good meat to be dressed and calling all their servants into the court where the ceremony is to be performed they place the food on a table where also two incensepots are placed and then the mandarine presents a paper to the clerk who reads it with an audible voice in the first place there is drawn up an ample account of all that god has blessed him withal as health riches honor favor of his prince etc and long life if he be old and toward the conclusion there is a petition to god for a continuance of all these blessings and a further augmentation of them especially with long life and favor of his prince which last they esteem as the greatest of all blessings while this paper is reading the master kneels down and bows his face to the earth and when the clerk has done reading it he puts it to the burning rushes that are in the incensepot where it is consumed then he flings in three or four little bundles of sacred paper which is very fine and gilded and when that also is burnt he bids his servants eat the meat  it is singular that in matters relative to their oaths of allegiance oath a species of sacrament is annually performed at the season in which the mandarines receive from the great officers under them the oath of fidelity to the king this is attended with the following ceremony they cut the throat of a hen and let the blood fall into a basin of arrack of which every man has a small portion given him to drink after he has publicly declared his loyalty and zeal to serve his prince and this is esteemed the most solemn tie by which any person can engage himself  the christian religion made considerable progress in this kingdom about the year    0 missionaries and some time after here were two bishops one styled of ascalon the other of adran but neither they nor the priests were suffered to come to cachao their residence being fixed at hean the proselytes they made were among the meanest of the people and it is suggested were gained over more by the charitable donations of rice in times of scarcity than by any arguments of the pious missionaries the priests were all masters of some mechanic arts which were useful in this country and which seem to have been the grounds of their toleration by reason of some imprudence on their part or some spirit of persecution in the reigning powers they were at length expelled and four of the principal missionaries put to death by decapitation  i will conclude with the extent of the kingdom of tonquin extent and with a brief account of the inhabitants it commences toward the south at the cochinchina wall and is there very narrow to the west it is bounded by the cochinchinese chain which soon retires and gradually leaves a larger and larger expanse to the great plain of this kingdom these mountains keeping to the northwest unite with those of china and by their branches turning eastward constitute the boundaries between tonquin and the mighty empire of which the tonquinese seem originally to have been a colony the western limit is at the river gannan kyan in lat        the province bordering on china on the side of the bay is that of tenan small but extremely fertile in rice off the coast are multitudes of isles very properly called by the dutch the islands of pirates they are inhabited by fishermen who make no scruple of robbing every ship they can master those can only be of the most defenseless kind for these pirates have no other vessels than the boats in which they carry on the fishing business and those unprovided with any sort of firearms from the extreme corruption of the government there is no redress to be obtained against their excesses an english captain has been fined for killing one of the crew of these petty thieves which had showed a design of attacking his vessel  in one of the isles the tonquinese have a customhouse which is said to bring in a million of rixdollars  the kingdom is very populous natives being thick set with villages the natives generally are of a middle stature of the tawny india color but the fairest and clearest of the kind a blush or change of tint may be seen in some of them on any surprise of passion imperceptible in any other indians their faces are flattish and oval their noses and lips of due proportions and altogether agreeable their hair black long and lank very thick and hanging down to their shoulders  their teeth are like those of the siamese as black as art can make them black teeth the dying occupies three or four days and is done to both boys and girls when they are about twelve or fourteen years old during the whole operation they never take any nourishment except of the liquid kind for fear of being poisoned by the pigment if they swallowed what required mastication every person high and low rich and poor is obliged to undergo this severe operation alleging it would be a disgrace to human nature to have teeth white as those of dogs or elephants to which they compare those who labor under that misfortune  prior with his usual humor mentions this custom but transfers it to the chinese  in china none hold women sweet unless their snags are black as jet king chihu put nine queens to death convict on statute ivory teeth thus ends my account of india extra gangem the tonquinese have so much similitude with the chinese that it is with some reluctance i place them as a separate people the uniformity of manners the religion and even the personal appearance begin to show themselves far more to the south the chinese had spread themselves to many of the kingdoms we have passed over and the likeness is retained in proportion as they kept distinct or mixed with the natives so as to occasion a deviation from their native features and national customs we fall in with the general arrangement of geographers and leave the artificial distinctions which separate them from that great empire whence they originated the ancients thought otherwise and formed of those kingdoms a mighty government distinguished from their neighbors to the south and to the north by the general name of thinae or sinae  china china the miracle of governments government its dominion extends from the streights of hainan in north lat  0    to the extremity of the province of pecheli in lat       comprehending a space of near fifteen hundred miles in length and in breadth above a thousand the numbers of its inhabitants given by the lively voltaire are a hundred and fifty millions the more accurate information obtained by lord macartneys embassy makes the population of china proper amount to    000000 inhabiting a space of         square miles e  yet all are ruled by a single man the government is founded on the law of the fifth commandment and the honor paid to the emperor in the character of father amounts to a veneration due to the divinity himself the greatest of his subjects never speak to him without kneeling his words are law and every thing he says is received as oracular the same respect proportionably diminished is rendered to all his servants as emanations of his sacred person from the first mandarine down to the lowest officer who is invested with delegated power he is called tyentse the son of heaven thauting palace royal vanswi ten thousand years and by other epithets emblematic of the sanctity of his person all this results primarily from the sense of filial duties early imprinted on the hearts of his subjects as the first and greatest point of religion and objects of the cognizance of the magistrate if a son is incorrigible by a parent the parent takes him before the judge who seldom fails to bring him to a sense of his duty filial respect says confucius in his auking a book on that very subject is the foundation of all virtue and of the wise government of the empire  children are treated by the parents with the utmost rigor the doctrine of obedience is inculcated with the greatest severity so that it becomes ever after habitual but as this respect toward their superiors is attended with fear and meanness so deceit and fraud become the characteristics of the chinese nation  the same respect to those in a higher station pervades all ranks of people hence the chinese are the most ceremonious of mankind and the very lowest orders full of the most profound artificial civility  the emperor has the disposal of all offices nay even of the lives and fortunes of every subject nothing is done of any moment from one extremity to the other of this vast empire without his knowledge in criminal cases the calendar of prisoners convict are laid before him with a statement of their crimes these lists are returned to the respective judges with the sentence affixed to each name be it of death or free pardon the lesser punishments are left to the pleasure of the magistrate  the despotism of the emperor is founded upon law and custom despotic not expressed yet fully implied it seems admitted that he can do no wrong but it is on the principle that the state is a vast family that tyen i e the supreme being has placed him on the throne in order that he may be a father and a mother to his people in consequence of this a strong sense of his duty is continually before his eyes the mandarines and princes of the blood are at liberty to remind him of any faults he may fall into and even the people if they find him negligent are as ready to become tumultuous as in any other country the grand secret of government in the emperor is the unremitting attention paid to the conduct of the mandarines and other magistrates who are carefully watched and most severely punished on every failure of duty he himself is perpetually anxious to consult the good of his subjects and to avoid incurring their hatred or contempt  there is no country in which the filial duties are carried to such a length filial duties a veneration for fathers says montesquieu spirit of laws vol i p      was necessarily connected with a suitable respect for all who represented fathers such as old men masters magistrates and the emperor this respect for fathers supposed a return of love toward children and consequently the same return from old men to the young from magistrates to those who were under their jurisdiction and from the emperor to his subjects this formed the rites and these rites the general spirit of the nation  a parricide is extremely rare in this empire whenever it happens the whole province is in alarm the relations are punished and the mandarines deposed as it is presumed it must have been through their neglect of admonition on the first appearance of filial misconduct that such a monster could be found the emperor himself is judge and the crime is expiated by the sentence of the criminal being cut into ten thousand pieces  the reigning vice of the chinese is selfinterest selfinterest which gives rise to the infinite variety of frauds of which they are justly accused lord ansons account of them is by no means exaggerated attempts have been made to clear them from the aspersion but all has proved a vain labor they consider the art of overreaching as a mark of superior genius and laugh at their dupe for suffering himself to be imposed on du halde tells a pleasant story of an english captain who had bargained with a chinese merchant for several bales of silk on opening the first he found it excellent but all the rest were quite rotten the captain reproached the merchant in the most severe terms the chinese with great coolness answered blame sir your rogue of an interpreter for he assured me that you never would examine the bales  pride and selfconceit are the other characteristic faults of this people pride they assume an imaginary preeminence over all the world and conceive nothing can be right but what they do their arts and their inventions have been brought to a certain point at which they must ever stop till they can prevale on themselves to lower their high opinion of superiority and improve upon the models brought from europe they can copy but they do it with reluctance as they look upon themselves to be the first of men a good effect arises out of this foible it represses luxury they think themselves wiser than the rest of mankind and that they are supplied with whatever their situation can require their rule of government their customs their arts their habits have remained for centuries the same and probably will continue so to the end of time  this leading feature is besides antiquity the result of the high and just opinion they entertain of the antiquity of the chinese nation in comparison of that of the rest of the world and they with truth observe that they were a polished people ages before the nations of modern europe had emerged from savage manners and profound ignorance  the founder of their empire is said to be fohi fohi founder of the empire cotemporary with phaleg and heber his subjects at that time were nearly in the state of nature they fed on what they caught ate it raw drank the blood and clothed themselves with the skins he taught them to make fishingnets and snares for birds to rear domestic animals and instructed them in various arts of life and to soften the fierceness of his people invented music and the instrument kin china was inhabited above two thousand years before the christian era demonstrable from an eclipse observed at that period the boast of the chinese is that their monarchy has continued four thousand years under the government of emperors that it experienced twentytwo dynasties or revolutions but the commotions each occasioned were so short that the country suffered very little inconveniency and returned immediately into its former regular system  the original religion of the chinese was truly pure religion and probably delivered to them by the first founder of the empire fohi as derived from the patriarchs amongst whom that illustrious character may nearly be ranked the first who reached china brought with them the religion of noah they acknowledged one great and supreme being and professed to live according to his laws engraven on their hearts they justly made that being the model of perfection possessed of omnipotence omniscience providence goodness justice and mercy they admit the doctrine of grace for they say that the most wicked man if he makes use of the assistance offered to him by tyen or the supreme being may attain the highest virtues they hold also an expiation of sins by their own sacrifices but confess that no external adoration will be accepted unless it is attended with inward sentiments and comes directly from the heart i cannot in my contracted plan give all the detail of their religion or the proofs of its origin from the patriarchs i will only say that like them they had their pentateuch their five volumes correspondent with the mosaical history are esteemed by them the source of all science and morality  the great reformer of the religion of china was consucius confucius cotemporary with pythagoras and born     years before christ he purged it from all corruptions and brought it to the perfection we have described it still continues the religion of the emperor and of the good and learned throughout his vast dominions  about six hundred years before the christian era sect of tautse arose the sect of tautse founded by laukyun who confined the felicity of this life to voluptuousness and taught that the soul died with the body yet at the same time admitted the existence of a divine being which makes some people believe that his doctrine had been corrupted by certain of his profligate disciples who might think it better to perish than burn yet as they must necessarily be perpetually disturbed with the thoughts of death they pretended to have invented a liquor of immortality which with the credulity of some of the emperors gave a prodigious increase to their followers they were greatly addicted to magic introduced worship of spirits sacrificed to devils and deluded the vulgar by a thousand juggling tricks  the last was the sect of fo or fwe not to be confounded with the great fohi sect of fo their doctrine was transported out of india about    years after the birth of christ an emperor dreamed of a saying of confucius that the holyone was to be found in the west he sent ambassadors to india who brought back the monstrous image fo and all the extravagances of the hindoo mythology temples or pagodas were erected in all places and those filled with the most monstrous idols they were attended by bonzees innumerable this is the religion of the vulgar but not always confined to them the emperors have at times been infected with it deceived by the seeming austerities practiced by the bonzees and their senseless penances similar to those of some of the indian faquirs  the christian religion was introduced here as early as the year     when to the astonishment of the chinese christianity there appeared among them a set of men with fair hair and blue eyes and of an air form and habit quite unknown these proved to be certain bishops priests and deacons sent out of judea to propagate the gospel in these distant parts they were syrians and nestorians at that time jesuiabas says mosheim vol ii p    was at the head of that sect the memory of this transaction was quite lost for ages till in the year      a monument was found in digging under ground near singansu in the province shensi it was a table of marble ten feet long and five broad containing the names of the missionaries and a history of the cause of their coming written in the syriac language which was translated by the jesuits who happened to be in china at the time of its discovery and is given in kirchers china illustrata there is no doubt of the authenticity the jesuits are charged with a most useless and unavaling forgery especially by voltaire the curious may see more of the affair in renaudots account of india and china trans pt ii p    et seq  the effect of this mission did not continue long at first they made abundance of proselytes they were favored by the reigning emperor permitted to build churches and inculcate their doctrine among his subjects this monument brings down their history to     the time of its being made in the year     an emperor inimical to the monastic life arose and by an ordinance entirely suppressed every religious house this was in fact levelled at the bonzees and the professors of the idolatry of fo or fwe who had not only expended vast sums in the ornaments of their pagodas and monasteries convents but made them sanctuaries for all kinds of profligates this event corresponds exactly with our celebrated dissolution here four thousand six hundred of the great monasteries of male and female recluses and forty thousand of the lesser were directed to be demolished the lands and revenues to revert to the royal domain and a hundred and fifty thousand slaves belonging to the houses to be set at liberty enrolled and ranked among the people as to these christians who in the ordinance are called outlandish bonzees from tatsing or muhupa about three thousand in number they were also included and directed to return to a secular life to the end that the customs of our empire says the decree may be uniform and unmixed from this time the history of these people was consigned to oblivion nor ever would have been known but for the discovery of the signansu monument  the ambition of the great jesuit st st francis de xavier francis de xavier to extend the power and importance of his new order is mentioned largely at vol i p     of this work  in      he sailed from goa to japan and after discharging his mission in that island determined on a visit to china death frustrated his pious design but preserved him from the mortification of being refused an entrance into the empire according to the most rigid ordinances then in force he departed this life off the isle of sancian the chinese had no objection to receive a dead christian they permitted his interment his coffin was filled with unslacked lime which miraculously lost its nature and the body preserved uninjured was found entire sweet and with all moisture fifty years after du halde says only as many months and brought with due veneration to the city of goa  from this period to the end of the same century jesuits no attempt was made to follow the great example of st xavier a few dominicans and franciscans would have landed in china with the same pious intention could they have obtained leave the honor of preaching the gospel with any success in this great empire was reserved for the rising order of the jesuits  valignon superior general of the order of the mission of india resident at macao burning with zeal for the great design selected three of his society for the purpose roger of naples pasio of bologna father ricci and ricci of macerata the last was a man of superior abilities who with his two brethren had rendered themselves masters of the chinese language at goa before they began their mission they entered on it in the year      after several unfavorable essays ricci found his way to the court he had all the art and insinuation of his order a noble air great sweetness of temper and an extensive knowledge of the sciences particularly of the mathematics he came also provided with presents he gave the emperor a clock a picture of our savior and another of the virgin each of which say the jesuits had a most honorable place pasio and roger had been recalled and the whole power was vested in ricci under whom crowds of subordinate jesuits preached the gospel with the utmost success they seemed to have a toleration or at least a connivance they reconciled the doctrine of their great master and the rites of the christian religion with the ceremonies of that of china ricci permitted his proselytes to assist at the annual commemoration of the followers of consucius and to intermingle the rites of both churches so as to gain converts innumerable he baptized several mandarines and persous of rank among others two rich widows one by the name of candida the other that of agatha the wealthy founded churches and the poor filled them with their numbers persecutions were raised against them but the abilities of ricci overcame them all he died highly respected in    0 at peking in the reign of van lie and by the order of the emperor was most honorably interred in a garden allotted for that purpose ricci incontestibly merited the title he received of founder and father of the chinese church  several other jesuits of great abilities successively supported his labors a persecution had been raised against them but luckily at the same time an invasion was threatened by the tartars a mandarine a christian convert advised the calling in the assistance of the portuguese engineers to direct the artillery the advice was taken and their success again brought the christians into favor  father schaal was employed in casting of cannon father verbiest and father verbiest another jesuit of first rate abilities was engaged in the same service it certainly was not the spiritual merits of the fathers that gained them the patronage of the chinese emperors but their knowledge of the arts they had brethren of all prosessions painters mechanics turners watchmakers founders accomptants astronomers and masters of ordnance verbiest and some of the ablest of the fathers were consulted about matters of state and by those various means became a most powerful ministry they were created mandarines and appeared at court in a rich dress of that order with the dragon flaming on their breasts camhi even issued an edict in favor of the christian religion among the miracles of the times an eunuch converted fifty ladies and helena taming empress of china held epistolary correspondence with pope alexander viith  unfortunately for the jesuits in      an inundation of other missionaries poured into the empire dominicans the dominicans and the franciscans were zealous to partake of the honor and share in the good work but again unluckily for both the jesuits were more of this world their rivals of the other the last soon discovered the arts by which the jesuits had established their power in china they would not condescend to preach any but the pure doctrine of christianity an inveterate quarrel ensued among these holy men the dominicans and franciscans carried their complaints to rome the grounds of which were discussed in the highest ecclesiastical courts and with various success the monks had the most subtle orders to counteract them the controversy lasted a hundred years bulls had been sent to peking to disannul all the temporizing compliances of the jesuits with the religious rites of the chinese some they evaded and at other times by their power at court excited persecutions against their christian brethren they even procured the imprisonment of tournon a legate from the pope himself his holiness honored the sufferer with the cardinals hat he received it in consinement and soon after died the ridicule of the political jesuits the reader will find a very candid and entertaining account of the christian church by moshcim in the chinese miscellanies published in      in two small volumes my plan forbids me from entering further into the history let it suffice to say that the jesuits from the death of kamhi experienced vicissitudes of fortune were either depressed or exalted according to the genius of his successors or according to the uses to which they were found subservient the dissolution of the order probably put an end to the christian church in this political empire for a statement of the present situation of the missionaries etc of the christian religion in this empire the reader is referred to vol ii p     et seq of sir g stauntons account of the embassy e   another nation eminent for extending their religion far and wide could never effect by the power of the sword what this artful order did by insinuation and by temporizing with the customs and manners of the people of whom they intended to make their advantages the arabs arabs who in other places inculcated the doctrine of their famed impostor by conquest and violence here never made the attempt long masters of the sea they came from the coasts of africa or of arabia and india in the form of traders in the tenth century the chinese admitted them into their ports in that character but denied them permission to propagate their faith as they had done in india they were strictly forbidden to make any converts but were allowed the free exercise of their own religion as long as they did not interfere with that of the empire the portuguese when they first arrived in china found the cities full of arabs or moors and father navarette a dominican missionary in china in      informs us that in his time there were about five hundred thousand which had greatly increased by intermarriages with the natives that many of them took their degrees among the chinese literati which evinces how the arabs carried with them a thirst after knowledge but they were looked on by their brethren as apostates for mingling with a nation whose rites were so contrary to their own  notwithstanding the mahometans have been settled so many centuries in china they are in many places considered as intruders are treated most contemptuously by the vulgar and sometimes their mosques have been demolished by the mob  let me now return to the temporal concerns of the chinese empire last revolution the last revolution was effected in      the emperor tsongching reduced to despair by a successful rebellion put himself to death his brave general made head against the usurper but unfortunately like our vortigern called in the assistance of a foreign power he invoked the manchew tartars who headed by their monarch tsongte united with him and expelled the usurper tsongte died as soon as that was effected but before his death declared his infant son emperor of china the general found his error too late yet submitted to the necessity and supported the new succession from that time the tartar line continued on the throne but the prince and all the tartarian subjects he brought with him adopted in the most minute articles the ancient rules of the empire its laws and customs and assumed the habits of the conquered people tartars and chinese are admitted indifferently to places of trust civil and military the tartars compose most of the garrisons but are now grown as effeminate as the chinese themselves and very little superior to the native soldiery the army of china consists of seven hundred thousand men dispersed in garrisons or along the great wall are well clothed and armed and make a fine figure on a review or on a march  the characteristic features of the chinese in the males form of the chinese are a large forehead short nose well cut small eyes a large and square face great broad ears a middle sized mouth black hair and a large and fat body these constitute beauty in our sex the complexions in general are as fair as europeans unless in the southern provinces or among the rank of people who are obliged to be exposed to the open air  the noses of the females are short their eyes little their ears long their complexions ruddy their features regular and countenances gay their feet artificially small little feet it has ever been the custom of the nurses to bind those parts so close as to prevent them from growing they esteem this a beauty notwithstanding it gives them a lameness in their gait yet they think the smallness of their feet a charm and show them as much as possible  i shall now speak of the genius of this singular people arts and the progress they have made in the arts  i will begin with the medical medical all their materia medica answers to our galenical medicines being drawn from simples they have a good knowledge of the uses of the vegetable kingdom they never meddle with the violent remedies gentle cathartics emollients strengtheners are the kinds they principally prescribe green and bohea tea the ginseng and other salutary roots are much in use they are totally ignorant of anatomy but pretend to great sagacity in the knowledge of the pulse they not only judge of the species and nature of the disease but apply their remedy according to the symptoms it exhibits i refer to du halde vol ii p      for the long but curious account of the practice they were well acquainted with the circulation of the blood long before the europeans attained that knowledge as they know nothing of anatomy it must be by reasoning on the force and action of the pulse they bleed even with a bit of broken china  they had the knowledge of inoculation a great many years ago inoculation it is a disputed point whether the turks from whom we learned the salutary art received it from the chinese by means of the armenian caravans or whether the same people might not have communicated it to the chinese certain it is that they have long been in possession of the method and the emperor kamhi made a noble use of it sending skilful persons into tartary and other parts of his dominions to inoculate the children of his tartarian subjects and others the distemper in every part of the empire being dreaded to the highest degree making the same havoc among these eastern people as the plague in the western world  the art of printing was invented under the emperor mingtsong printing about the year of our lord  0  being above five hundred years before it was discovered in europe they trace the types through the written copy on blocks of wood so never have occasion to break the press as we do in our quarter of the globe  the manufacture of paper was originally discovered by tsayjun paper a great mandarine of the palace a d    who made it nearly in the manner we do from old fragments of cloth or silk and the bark of trees boiled and reduced to a thin paste the consumption of paper in this empire is prodigious the cacoethes scribendi occasions an amazing demand and the quantity used for the papering of their rooms is inconceivable their painted papers are more famed for the richness of the colors than the justness and elegance of the design they have no notion of perspective nor the least skill in delineating the human figure all which appear like so many caricatures the subjects are chiefly domestic scenes agriculture such as the cultivation of rice etc etc of tea and the various processes from the planting to the package for foreign markets  the consumption of ink must necessarily be equal to that of paper the manufacture employs in the province of nanquin ink whole villages lampblack is the basis whether of the liquid ink used for printing or of that which is brought over to us under the name of indian ink in sticks with chinese characters and ornamented with colored figures of flowers etc the invention of ink in china is said to have been in the reign of venti about a hundred and sixty years before christ  the emperor kamhi caused the wars against the elaths and those on the frontiers of little bucharia to be painted and sent long after into europe in order to be engraven by the best artists these were the performances of the jesuits and done in a very good manner they were placed in the hands of le bas at paris and engraven in    0 the plates were sent to china but because the figures in the back grounds were not drawn as large as those in the fore the plates were returned to be altered which was done quite to the taste of the chinese the mountain scenery is magnificent the actions or surprises cruel and sanguinary the fortified places and little wooden forts exactly represented with various specimens of the art military of these distant asiatics i observed the bactrian or two bunched camel much in use carrying swivel guns on their backs which were discharged at the fugitives climbing up the steeps of the mountains this work consists of sixteen very large prints finely engraven the copies in europe are rare ten thousand pounds were allowed for the execution  the use of artillery was not known among the chinese till the arrival of the europeans artillery the first cannon they ever saw were three sent as a present to the emperor by the portuguese of macao in      these were afterward used against the tartars who came in swarms to the great wall but terrified by the slaughter made among them by these novel machines of war they never approached it more  gunpowder was invented in europe by a monk gunpowder the first cannon ever cast in china were the work of a jesuit father adam schaal by order of the emperor the next of the father verbiest the great ornament of the order he first cast a hundred and thirty and after that three hundred and twenty they were tried in the presence of the emperor who so greatly approved the services of verhiest that he loaded him with honors the jesuits in return fixed on a day for blessing his labors dressed in his religious habit he nine times prostrated himself and beat his forehead against the ground he had previously fixed a crucifix on an altar before the train of artillery which he baptized piece by piece and gave to each the name of a male or female saint taken from the calendar of his own church  gunpowder was of very early invention in china and in india but till the time that i have just mentioned it was never applied to any other uses than fireworks on festive occasions in which the chinese still excel all the rest of the world i refer the reader to p     of the preceding volume for what i have said on the subject of the powder and artillery of the orientalists  voltaire asserts that the chinese had a manufactory of glass above two thousand years ago glass du halde says that looking glasses are not among their articles of furniture they have indeed at yenching in the province of shangtung a manufactory but so brittle is their lewli or glass as to break when exposed to too cold an air i am farther confirmed by my worthy friend thomas fitzhugh esquire long resident in china that the art of making glass in china was in a very imperfect state as he informs me that about sixty or seventy years they were supplied with that article from england which would not have been the case had they excelled at home the glass was carried over in pieces in the shape of bricks from which trade it may be supposed the chinese either did not then make it or that they found it more expensive in the process than purchasing the articles from foreigners the manufacture of glass if a mere repetition of the fusion of broken pieces or of cakes brought from europe deserves the name is confined to canton and unknown in the rest of the empire e embassy to china vol ii p       the works in japan or varnish japanning are very considerable in this empire but do not equal those made in japan itself the best is that of tonking and nanking the varnish is produced from the rhusvernix which the chinese call tsi it is the same with that i have described at p    of this volume the process in collecting it is the same and the workmen are affected with the same diseases in the operation i therefore will not repeat what i have before mentioned  the very important article of silk shall next be spoken of silk in my account of spain will be given the history of the origin of this manufacture and the various countries it passed through in its way from china its native seat the care of the silkworm was of the most early date it was begun by siling one of the queens of whangti third emperor from fohi at the period in which his subjects still clothed themselves in the undressed skins of wild beasts how surprising was the change for the luxurious habit of silk succeeding empresses followed her example they went attended by their fair suite to the orchard of mulberry trees gathered the leaves of three trees either with their own hands or by the hands of the ladies under their inspection a piece of the finest silk was woven and devoted to the ceremony of the sacrifice to the shangti or the supreme being more policy than religion is intermixed with this sacrifice the wise chinese knew that they could not enforce too strongly the cultivation of a tree which feeds the great staple of the empire  the chinese have two trees which contribute to this purpose mulberry trees the one is the sang or tesang the morus alba or white mulberry tree so well known in the south of europe this is cultivated in plantations the other kind is the che or yesang the wild mulberry which grows on the hills in forests has small roundish rough leaves scalloped on the edges and terminating in a point the branches thorny the fruit like pepper in a few words a tree of a distinct species if not genus from the former on these trees the young of the silkworms which are hatched are laid the silk produced from them is said to be stronger and earlier than from those bred on the common mulberry paths are cut among the forests of the che the ground is cleared of weeds which may give shelter to serpents that devour the worms and persons watch with guns to destroy the birds that make them their food these trees are also cultivated in some places like the white mulberry  i shall make mention of a species of silk totally different in its origin from the preceding this is described by du halde vol i      silk of pliny who says it is made by certain worms in the province of shangtong it is not fabricated by them into cocons but left adhering to small trees or shrubs in form of very long threads which are gathered and woven into a coarse silk called kien chew a very thick lasting sort which washes well and is in much esteem with the chinese  this account certainly vindicates the opinion held by the ancients that silk was an article combed from the leaves of certain trees primi sunt hominum says pliny speaking of the scytharum genesis lib vi c xvii qui noscantur seres lanicio sylvarum nobiles perfusam aqua depectentes frondium canitiem virgil delivers the same notion velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia seres the romans believed it to be the same kind which was produced at rome from the silkthread which had found its way there in the time of pliny which makes him complain of the great trouble the roman women had in winding and weaving their silk whilst the seres had no more to do than to gather it from the leaves of trees unde geminus foeminis nostris labor redordiendi fila rursusque texendi it was long before the manufacture of silks was established at rome the use was discouraged by a law forbidding men to debase themselves by the wearing of silk as fit only for women the effeminate heliogabalus is the first on record who wore a dress entirely of silk the manufactory even in the ribband or haberdashery way did not reach our kingdom till about the year      spain had very long the start of us our monarchs were forced to be content with cloth stockings henry viii accidentally got a pair now and then from spain sir thomas gresham presented a pair to edward vi which was much talked of mrs montague silkwoman to queen elizabeth presented her with a pair of black silk after which her highness would never wear any of cloth broad silks were not woven in england till the year    0 the southern and western parts of europe for centuries possessed that species of manufacture  the manufacture of cotton must have been of great antiquity cotton du halde vol i p     mentions the shrub and the time of the sowing which immediately follows the harvest and in the same field the produce is woven into calicoes and into a cloth well known in england by the name of nanquins so called from the place of manufacture i imagine that the chinese have not at present sufficient quantity of raw materials as great quantities are said of late to have been imported from india  of the woollen manufactures i can say very little woollens in the province of shensi the sheep and goats are sheered thrice a year and of the wool of the one and the hair of the other mixed is made a stuff much in request the sheep are the great tailed kind  the porcelain is of unknown antiquity porcelain the jesuit dentrecolles who had a church in a town in the province of kingteching a first rate city which contained upwards of a million of people could not trace the origin that reverend father has been indefatigable in his enquiry and has produced a most elaborate account of the materials and process  the first knowledge which the europeans had of china was by the means of the seres seres inhabitants of the northern parts of the empire these very distant people were among the nations whom the fame of augustus had reached and who complimented him with an embassy which took four years journey to perform they presented the emperor with pearls precious stones and elephants silk is not mentioned yet probably virgil learned from them that it was the production of their country as i remark from the line of his at p  0  horace informs us how expert the seres were in the use of the bow  puer quis ex aula capillis ad cyathum statuetur unctis doctus sagittas tendere sericas arcu paterno the capital of these people is called by ptolemy sera metropolis and placed by him in lat       which so nearly agrees with the latitude of kingchew in the province of pecheli as to leave no doubt of that having been the site i have at p   of the first volume of this work mentioned the comedae and the station of those who were bound for the commerce with the seres a branch of the imaus runs from thence to the northeast and after some space to the east part of the country to the southeast of this chain is the scythia intra imaum and the part to the northeast is the serica regio or land of the seres various towns or cities of little use to note are mentioned by ptolemy in his time the resting places of the merchants in their road to the sera metropolis we know no more than that there was a commerce carried on with this country by caravans from the more western world that it was interrupted by the parthians who had possessed themselves of most of the country from the caspian sea to this branch of the imaus and by that means the intercourse was entirely cut off  very long is the interval between that period and that in which we can find any travelers who had visited this distant country by land in the year    0 nicolo polo and his brother maffio illustrious venetians set out on their commercial journey they took their departure from constantinople for the splendid courts of the tartarian princes who lived in great magnificence and gave the utmost encouragement to the european merchants and artists to come among them and improve them in the arts william ruysbroek rubruquis better known by the name of friar rubruquis made two journeys into great tartary and mentions guillaume lorfevre and other artists who were employed in the service of mongukhan to this day many rich proofs of the skill of european artists are discovered in tombs and other places the polos remained nine years abroad and returning nicolo found his wife dead he had left her pregnant the child survived and became the famous traveller so well known by the name of marco polo marco polo his father in      accompanied his brother on another journey and took marco then only eleven years of age with him they arrived at the court of kublaykhan commonly called by the chinese shitsu fifth emperor of cathay or northern china of the mogol race a monarch of abilities and a great encourager of the arts he took a particular liking to young marco who soon learned to read and write the four languages in use in the country he was in the service of the emperor seventeen years the royal residence during summer at that time was kambalu or rather hampalu i e the seat of the emperor the same with the modern peking but the capital of the empire was the present nanquin kublaykhan made use of marco on several important embassies and weighty affairs the father and brother continued with the court and in their commercial capacities contributed to its splendour by procuring jewels and all the materials of luxury marco his father and uncle remained with the khan a great number of years and returned safe to venice in      enriched by their profession and in the highest esteem with their countrymen  marco wrote his travels which have been published in most languages he was a diligent and faithful observer i must refer to bergeron to purchase but particularly to john reinhold forster for the detail of his travels he gives a most splendid account of the court of his master and shows the state of the polite arts in china in those early days mentions the use of the silkworm the knowledge of the making of paper from the morus papyrisera the distillation of brandy from the milk of mares and numbers of other curious circumstances beyond the limits of my plan marco was also attentive to the natural history of the country mentions coals which he calls black combustible stones describes some sorts of falcons and cranes the argus pheasant or pheasants with tails thirty inches long and in particular speaks about the number of partridges and quails he takes notice of the musk animal hist quad i no    the thibet cows with long silky tails no   the argali no    or wild sheep with enormous horns and several other matters both natural and oeconomical which have since been confirmed by more modern travelers  i shall now speak of the celebrated sir john mandeville sir john mandeville sir john was born at st albans and became the greatest traveller of his or any other age having been out thirtyfour years and in the character of pilgrim knight errant and man of observation visited the greatest part of africa and asia then known it is probable that he penetrated as far as china he left an account of his travels which were shamefully falsified by the monks who destroyed much of their credit by mingling with them legendary tales and stories out of pliny but still truth appears so frequently that the authenticity of the ground work is by no means impaired he was called johannes de mandevile aliter dictus ad barbam from his forked beard he found a grave at liege in the convent of the gulielmites in      he is engraven on his tomb armed and treading on a lion at his head the hand of one blessing him and these words in the french of the time vos ki paseis sor mi pour lamour deix proies por mi his knives horse furniture and spurs were in the time of ortelius preserved at liege by the monks and shown to strangers  the intercourse which the muscovites had by their caravans with this part of the eastern world will be given in a future volume russians i shall not therefore introduce it here but proceed to the first discovery of china by sea by the europeans in the busy sixteenth century in the year      alvarenga portuguese the portuguese viceroy of the indies turned his thoughts toward a settlement in china and bestowed on ferdinand pedro andrada an able officer the conduct of the expedition in june      he set sail from malacca with three ships and arrived at the island of tamanlabua four leagues from the main land of china at that time the coast was infested with pirates and fortunately andrada fell in says osorio vol ii p      with the imperial fleet who on sight of him thinking him a pirate prepared for battle but how great was their surprise when they found that he gave no sign of hostile intention but sailed peaceably with them till they anchored off the isle of tama i believe this to be the same which mr nieuhoff voy p    calls heytamon and possibly that on which macao was built the chinese admiral there sent to enquire who these strange people were and received such an answer as quite gained his confidence andrada then sailed with them for the port of nanto a fine city and harbor about sixty miles from canton there he met with the most hospitable reception and by his prudent conduct quite conciliated the affection of the chinese he landed there the ambassador thomas perez who was immediately conducted to the imperial court andrada returned to the isle of tama informed himself of every thing that was necessary and greatly enriched himself and companions by his commerce with the merchants who flocked to him from different countries he left china after impressing on the nation the highest opinion of the integrity of his countrymen  all this was ruined by the ill conduct of simon his brother who soon after arrived there to form the settlement after building a fort he thought himself secure and began to offer insults and violence of every kind to the natives who fell on the portuguese killed numbers and obliged simon to secure himself by flight  the emperor dismissed the ambassador who on his arrival at canton was flung into prison by the citizens where he perished miserably  the portuguese for a long time were the detestation of the chinese toward the close of the century they regained their affection by a piece of service they had an opportunity of doing to the empire by relieving it from the insult of the pirate changsilau who had seized on the island of macao and was besieging canton the emperor presented the portuguese with macao as a reward who fortified it with two hundred pieces of cannon at which the subtle chinese took no sort of umbrage for they had stationed their forces in such a manner as to cut them off at will from even their daily provision the portuguese still retain possession of the city and have a governor of their own but a mandarine resides here who is supreme over the whole island so that they are in a very dependant state and they besides pay an annual tribute on the original agreement of being permitted to erect fortifications they enjoy their own laws and religion and have a bishop of macao suffragan to the archbishop of goa  the english came in late for their share of the chinese trade english in      we made an unsuccessful attempt to get there but arrived no farther than the brazils our thoughts at that period were full of the rich cathaian coast and all europe was engaged in many an attempt for the discovery of the passage to it but mountains of ice did stop the imagined way beyond petsora eastward to the rich cathaian coast   our first factory in that empire was about the year   0  first at chusan when the chinese granted to us chusan a small island not far from the coast of tchetchiang in lat  0  0 it had been totally depopulated by the

phoenician stratagem of the oxs hide in the building of byrsa or the famous carthage the japanese had not long before made a conquest of the island but were too weak to resent this perfidy the dutch now were in possession of a flourishing trade with the two great empires of china and japan it was lost to them in the year      by the fault of the factions which reigned at batavia the seat of the dutch government in india iquon a tailor who lived in the dutch town on the island of formosa a man of undaunted courage had revolted from the chinese empire and became so powerful as to induce the emperor to get him seized by persidy and poisoned coxenga his son coxenga inherited all his abilities at first he applied to the dutch for succor but being refused turned his resentment against them he prepared a vast fleet and army landed near the dutch settlement and notwithstanding every effort of the governor frederick cojet whose defense was gallant and obstinate at length compelled him to surrender by capitulation cojet had been at first neglected by his countrymen who when it was too late sent a strong fleet from batavia it met with a severe repulse and was compelled to leave their colony to its fate we shall hereafter meet the european nations at their common permissive settlement at canton i shall quit the subject i have been on and change it to that of a particular topography of the coasts of the vast empire  to speak generally boundaries of china the country may be said to be divided to the south from thibet and boutan by chains of most exalted mountains branches of the imaus and hemodus they penetrate even into various parts of china other mountains equally high separate the empire from western tartary these vast alpine chains are the defenses of this mighty empire from invasions by land the great wall hereafter to be mentioned secures the parts unprotected by nature the coast is usually rude and rocky and the interior often rises into craggy picturesque mountains or is intersected by numerous rivers and canals the seas are shallow so that even from a naval attack the country has its protection  notwithstanding part of china is within the tropics and the great remainder does not exceed lat    north yet the cold is during winter intense there is no country in which exists such a necessity for furs their own empire tartary and siberia is almost exhausted for the supply the english even furnish them with quantities from north america ice has been seen at canton an inch in thickness between nimpo and peking the cold has been so severe in january and february that travelers have been forced to lie by till the ice could be broken on the river hoambo the largest in china before they could pass over mr kirwan says that the greatest cold at peking in lat       is   the greatest heat    yet on july   th      the thermometer rose to  0  and   0 the extremest cold is produced by a northeast or northwest wind the last blows over the vast tract of tartary and siberia in peking during winter the animals and fowls of all kinds are exposed to sale in the markets frozen and so preserved from putrefaction for weeks together  the interior of china maintains a most singular character it is varied with chains of mountains winding along its surface yet so as to leave valleys that enabled one of the emperors to open a communication by water partly by means of rivers and partly by navigable canals from peking to canton a distance of   00 miles little interruption occurs in this vast space except the lofty mountains which separate the provinces of kiangsee and quantung we shall speak farther of this and the other canals in their proper places  i shall now enter on the topographical account island of hainan commencing at its southern extremity the island of hainan i e the south of the sea expresses its situation it belongs to the province of quangtung which opposite to hainan juts far south in a peninsulated form and is distant above twelve miles from the shore is a hundred and sixty leagues in circumference and produces every thing that can conduce to the wants and conveniences of life the climate alone is bad by reason of the quality of the water gold the island abounds with gold but as it has been but half conquered that valuable metal is in the power of the natives a brave independent people who live in the middle parts amidst arduous mountains the rest of the country being a plain the inhabitants had long a traffic with the chinese one was deputed to examine the goods offered and on the other part a chinese merchant went to see those of the mountaineers the utmost honor was observed on both sides the chinese especially the governor made immense profit of the gold this the great kanghi discovered and put a final stop to a commerce which till then had been allowed by law the lapis armenus which produces blue so much in request for coloring the porcelane is also found here and much of it sent to canton for that purpose the fisheries are very lucrative twenty or thirty thousand jonks of no inconsiderable size come annually from canton to take in cargoes of the dried or salted fish our companys ships now and then put in here and may be secure during the monsoons  the continent after attaining the bottom of the peninsula trends toward the northeast and is all the way skirted with isles those best known to mariners are the two sanciams the false and that called saint johns beneath which is good anchorage the great ladrone and the asses ears are noted land marks the entrance of the vast bay of canton opens to the east of sanciam the breadth there is about two and twenty leagues and the depth nearly the same but filled with islands divided by most narrow and intricate channels possibly these might be the gates of china mentioned by the two mohammedan travelers of the ninth century as canton was their canfu even at that time a most flourishing city it was also the canectum of the nubian geographer page      sanciam is famed for having been the place of interment of saint francis de xavier isle of sanciam and for his tomb which still is to be seen another isle is that of hoanpou where the dutch had built a fort in order to command the navigation of the tigris or river of canton their design was discovered and they were all massacred  the most important city is that of macao macao seated on a little peninsula and which was during a certain period celebrated for its wealth and commerce it is now quite declined from its former splendour but is well known to the europeans as the place where their ships commonly anchor in their way inward and from being the residence of all the european factories who are obliged by the chinese to quit canton as soon as the ships have left the river typa about six miles lower is the typa a harbor for careening of ships here commodore anson heaved down the centurion in january      previous to the capture of the manilla ship on june  0th old style which established the great fortunes of that lucky house  the humen bocca tigris or tigersgate or the boccatigris of the portuguese is the narrow pass into that river which is not a musketshot over and defended by two miserable batteries mr anson passed them in his way to the canton river the poor pilot who reluctantly carried him through and the mandarine who commanded the forts were most severely punished for what they could not possibly help the commodore having threatened to hang the pilot in case of noncompliance the poor mandarine knew his own weakness the real mouth of the river is some miles below the bocca and has on one side the lions tower or pagoda the river takes from thence a grand curvature toward the west the anchoring place for the european ships is under the isle of wampoo a few miles to the east of canton the approach into the bay and the amazing view along the river is so graphically described by my favorite m le poivre that i cannot resist using the words of that enchanting author on the appearance of land says he i perceived along the horizon a forest of masts and soon after an innumerable multitude of boats which covered the surface of the water these were thousands of fishermen whose industry drew from the deeps subsistence for numbers the land now began to rise to my view i advanced to the mouth of the river still amidst crowds of fishers throwing out their lines on every side i entered the river of kanton it is people like the land its banks lined with ships at anchor a prodigious number of small craft are continually gliding along in every direction some with sails others with oars vanishing often suddenly from the sight as they enter the numberless canals dug with amazing labor across extensive plains which they water and fertilize immense fields covered with all the glory of the harvest with stately villages rising to the eye on every side adorn the remoter view whilst mountains covered with verdure cut into terraces and shaped into amphitheatres form the back ground of this noble landscape  the chinese divide their cities into first rate second and third canton the first may be known by the addition of foo the second by that of tchoo the third by that of hyen quangtchoofoo or canton is chief among the first as it is supposed to contain a million of inhabitants fachan a village a few miles higher has the same number this in some measure inclines us to think that voltaires calculation is not very far out of the way very populous the land and the very water is inhabited millions live in the sampanes or vessels placed on each side of the great rivers those of canton alone may contain two hundred and twentyfive thousand inmates thousands and thousands dwell on the exalted rocks some are excavated into mansions and every ledge has on its its elegant cottage swarms of people inhabit the edges of precipices as the myriads of birds do the great promontories of britain paths are cut through the rocks to render them accessible and over some are conducted even public roads i have seen several of these populated rocks most accurately represented in rice with all the economy of their inhabitants expressed  the city is divided into three the tartarian the chinese and a third beyond the first which is represented on the plan as a void space the streets are narrow but well paved and cross each other at right angles the whole is surrounded with a wall and each city separated from the other by another wall the gates of canton are shut in the evening as are the barriers at the end of every street so that the greatest cities are as quiet as a private family  triumphal arches are very frequent in most of the cities triumphal arches the ancient are the most elegant adorned with beautiful figures of men birds and flowers in altrelief quite standing from the stone and connected only by cordons left for the purpose these monuments are probably honorary memorials of the great actions of individuals  in front on each side of the city and on the opposite shore of the river european factories are large suburbs the factories of the european merchants consist of a long row of houses ranged on the river side and a space of land behind about two hundred yards broad each has a warehouse for its goods the mercantile nations are the english french imperialists dutch swedes and danes each factory has the flag of its country erected before it on a tall pole this is the only port in the whole empire allowed to the europeans their ships may take in wood and water where they please but are every where else strictly forbid to trade even here they are a sort of prisoners they are not to go beyond their bounds they may indeed enter the suburbs but are sure to meet with every species of abuse from the mob they are allowed to reside only during the time the ships remain at wampu for as soon as they sail for europe every factory is obliged to retire to macao till the season of their return  the proper name of the river of canton is taho river of canton or the great river the stream is rapid but affected by the tide which rises four or five feet opposite to the city it is navigable for numbers of miles into the interior parts of the country for large vessels from the sea even to the city of quangsi and again its advantages are spread far and wide by the infinity of canals not only this and other cities but the canals themselves for miles together have their quays made of cut stone of stupendous size forming the most magnificent sight which art applied to commercial purposes can exhibit  the river of canton is guarded by various fortifications the square castle on the island engraven by mr nieuhoff is a specimen of that kind of defense  the multitudes of ducks which animate the river about canton is amazing tame ducks they are hatched says mr latham ornith vol iii     by artificial heat the eggs being laid in boxes of sand are placed on a brick hearth to which is given a proper heat during the required time for hatching the ducklings are fed with little crawfishes and crabs boiled and cut small and afterward mixed with boiled rice and in about a fortnight shift for themselves when the chinese provide them an old stepmother who leads them where they are to find provender for themselves being first put on board a sampane or boat which is destined for their habitation and from which the whole flock often to the amount of three or four hundred go out to feed and return at command this method is used nine months out of the twelve for in the colder months it does not succeed and is so far from a novelty that it may be every where seen but more especially about the time of cutting the rice and gleaning the crop when the masters of the duck sampanes row up and down the river according to the opportunity of procuring food which is found in plenty at the tide of ebb on the rice plantations as they are overflowed at high water it is curious to see how the ducks obey their master for some thousands belonging to different boats will feed at large on the same spot and on a signal given will follow their leader to their respective sampanes without a stranger being found among them this is still more extraordinary if we consider the number of inhabited sampanes on the tigris supposed to be no less than forty thousand which are moored in rows close to each other with a narrow passage at intervals for boats to pass up and down the river the tigris at canton is somewhat wider than the thames at london and the whole river is there covered in this manner for the extent of at least a mile  the manner of taking the wild ducks in this country is singular wild ducks how taken the performers put their heads into the shells of large gourds with holes made in them to see and breathe through then going naked into the water they walk or swim so low that nothing appears but the gourds the ducks being accustomed to see gourds floating on the surface and to play about them approach without fear when the duckhunter taking them by the feet pulls them under water to prevent their making a noise wrings their necks and fastens them to his girdle pursuing his exercise till he has procured a great number  i may mention here that most elegant of ducks chinese teal the chinese teal latham ornith vol iii      but words are almost wanting to express the beauty of the coloring and the specific oddity of the fine feathers of the wings erecting themselves in a curved manner when the wings are closed mr edwardss representation tab  0  may serve to give the idea these are a scarce species and kept for sale at canton and sold at the rate of six or even ten dollars the pair  no country abounds with fishes equal to china fishes yet we have been very unfortunate by the inattention paid to that branch of its natural history osbeck and sparman both boasted disciples of linnaeus have given us but a very meagre catalogue from these and a few other sources i shall give all that i can collect let me observe that the most numerous genera of fresh water are the carp and the perch du halde mentions some curious species of fishes but his descriptions want the perspicuity of a naturalist so are unintelligible  du halde ii p     gives us two very curious methods of fishing covorants trained for fishing one is by means of a species of corvorant trained for the purpose by the figure given by mr nieuhoff p     it seems the very same to our common kind this corvorant proves to be a distinct species distinguished by the name of pelicanus sinensis and is figured in the   th plate of sir g stauntons account of the embassy to china the mode of conveying these birds from place to place is delineated in vol ii p     of that entertaining and interesting work e  the chinese call it louwa in mr willughbys ornithology p     we find that this species of fisheries was in old times frequently practiced in england mr latham vi     informs us that a kind of diver is used also for the same purpose in the morning says du halde i     when the sun rises one may see on the rivers a considerable number of boats and several of these birds sitting at the head of them then the fishermen turning their boats about at the signal given by striking the water with an oar the cormorants fly into the river one here another there and diving to the bottom seize the fish they light on by the middle then rising up again they carry it to the bark where the fisherman receiving it takes the bird and holding its head downwards passes his hand along the neck to make it disgorge the small fish that it had swallowed but is hindered from going into the gullet by a ring put on the lower part of the neck which after the fishing is quite over they take off and give them something to eat when the fish happens to be too large for one bird they mutually assist each other one takes the tail another the head and bring it to the boat to their master  the other way of taking fish is very simple and gives but little trouble for this purpose they make use of long narrow boats nailing on each side from one end to the other a plank two feet broad this plank is japanned with white shining varnish and slants gently till it almost touches the top of the water in the night time when it is used they turn it toward the moon that the reflection may increase its splendour so that the fish which are sporting easily mistaking the color of the japanned plank for that of the water leap often on that side and fall either on the plank or into the boat  in respect to quadrupeds quadrupeds this empire retains many of those of india but loses also several toward the northern and western parts others appear suited to the climate these are pointed out in the faunula which i reserve as a sort of appendix unwilling to interrupt the narrative part of this work  at canton begins the celebrated passage by water from hence to peking water passage to peking and the extremity of the great empire of china an extent says du halde vol ii      of six hundred leagues or about eighteen hundred english miles the emperor shitsu finding the defect of tribute he annually sustained or the vast loss of his subjects in the articles of commerce which perished at sea in the conveyance from the maritime parts of his dominions determined on creating an internal navigation imperial canal he began the work in      it is probable that he did not complete so stupendous an undertaking and it is imagined it was not finished till the time of yongjo who began his reign about thirtyfive years after we may well admit this as the length of the imperial canal is nine hundred miles the depth a fathom and a half and it conveys annually near ten thousand large barks belonging to the emperor besides others innumerable the property of merchants or of private people who hire them to travelers they are all richly ornamented especially the imperial which carry on them the dragon of five claws the arms of the empire the traveller if he takes the route of quangsi and huquang is under no necessity of ever quitting his bark from canton to peking he meets with rivers and lakes till he falls in again with the yuho or royal canal as it is named by way of preeminence on that canal the voyager is only obliged to quit his vessel once in nine hundred miles the mountain meylin intervenes and makes it necessary for him to take a days journey before he can again benefit of the royal work the shipping on the canal and rivers are often so numerous as to fill the channel for a mile or two and quite obstruct for a time their progress  great fairs are also kept on the rivers great fair on the water one season says hamilton at one place and in other seasons at other places and though there may be  0000 vessels assembled at a fair yet there is as good order and decorum kept as in a wellgoverned city all ships and boats who have the same species of goods are moored together along a certain place on the river side allotted for them by proper magistrates and at night watches are sent to prevent thieving and disorder and offenders are severely punished without respect of persons  john nieuhoff j nieuhoff the celebrated traveller of the last century is the only one sir george stauntons account of the spirited and wellconducted embassy to china was not published at the time this work was composed e who gives an account of the entire inland voyage from the south to almost the very north of the mighty empire that able writer was born on july   d      at uffen in the earldom of bentham of a respectable family his person was elegant his understanding good his temper and conversation amiable he was fond of the fine arts poetry music and drawing and master of several languages in the year      he entered into the dutch west india service and made his first voyage to the brazils where he resided nine years he has left us an admirable description of the country and of the many great events of that period which happened between his countrymen and the portuguese  his next voyage was to the east indies in the year      he visited the coast of malabar the peninsula of malacca and many of the islands even to the moluccas his accounts are the most satisfactory of any extant his attention to several branches of natural history was very considerable and he has given various plates of the fishes of the indies done with much accuracy considering the infant state of the science on this voyage he was eight years absent from home his last voyage designed also for the east indies was begun on january  st      he landed at madagascar in order to trade with the natives and as is supposed was with his people massacred by the inhabitants in the month of september of the same year for he never more was heard of diligent enquiry was made after him by the surviving part of the crew left on board his ship and afterward a yatch was dispatched from the cape of good hope to repeat the search which proved equally fruitless  his brother henry nieuhoff h nieuhoff collected together all the papers he left behind and published them to the great honor of his memory they were written and printed originally in dutch churchill has given us his voyage to the brazils and to the east indies in the second volume of his collection the learned hornius has translated into latin the famous journey from canton to peking this is so curious and novel that i shall attend the able traveller in his route and briefly notice the most remarkable things his travels to peking an embassy was determined on by the dutch to the coast of peking to the great emperor kanghi nieuhoff was fortunately appointed secretary his account is a firstrate performance and the more pleasing as it is attended with views of the country cities and buildings engraven from drawings done by his skilful pencil  the ambassadors had every possible respect paid to them they embarked at canton on board a magnificent jonk on march   th      amidst the acclamations of the people and a general discharge of the artillery the chinese sent avantcouriers from place to place to make provisions for their reception even till their arrival at peking  they began with ascending the river peikyangho all their route was marked with beautiful scenery and various towns and cities most of them surrounded with embattled walls and strengthened by square towers many of the landscapes are most picturesque we are struck with the river flowing by the vast mountain sangwonhab overhanging on both sides and on one a great frequented road strange road cut out of the solid rock impending over the water at the foot is a pagoda the nightly haunt say the natives of demons  farther on city xaochew not remote from the city xaochew or tchautchoofoo a vast mountain seems to open its sides to make room for the famed pagoda konjansjam filled with horrid idols to whom almost constant sacrifices are offered by the fanatical visitants  a little farther is the great castle mongley of a quadrangular form with a square tower at each corner equal in size within to a town seated on a losty eminence and accessible by a numerous flight of steps cut out of the live rock  the city xaochew next appears near the conflux of two rapid rivers infamous for frequent wrecks a pagoda is erected on the banks famed for its idol to which mariners send up their prayers for a safe passage as the romans did of old and as the christians of many parts of europe do to their saint elmo to this very day  the rocks called the five horses heads five horses heads and the still more curious rocks named suytjeen or the five horrible devils near to the ferry suytjeen as much dreaded as scylla and charybdis for the frequent shipwrecks near them they are of a columnar form and appear as if placed in order by human art  nanhang or nansheunfoo in lat          city nanhang is the last in the province of quangtung and a considerable trading city to the north of it is a famous road over the mountain meylin cut through the rock three miles in length with precipices on both sides but of a secure wideness this singular road being a great communication from north to south is perpetually crowded as much as the streets of the most populous cities on the summit is built a temple in honor of the mandarine who made this useful way at his own expense  after traveling some days on horseback nangan mr nieuhoff reached the great city nangan in the province of kyangsee seated on the river kanhyang in lat          this river runs through the middle of the province and divides it into two equal parts the chinese call it kankiang the kyang river or son of the sea and added that the sea is without shore and the kyang without bottom this fiction arises from the fishermen never using any sounding lines above sixty fathoms long but even that depth is a vast one for a river by means of the numerous canals that branch from it the city has vast commerce and was once celebrated for its porcelain of a snowy whiteness the province is rich in mines of gold silver iron lead and tin the silks are very beautiful and the rice and wine made from it is in high esteem in all parts of the empire  the lakes of this province are in the season covered with the beautiful blossoms of the nymphaea lotus and nelumbo nymphaea nelumbo no flowers are in such request with the chinese as these the great men have them transplanted into their little ponds filled for the purpose with mud and water in their courts the physicians esteem the fruit as highly restorative after long sickness and the root of the nelumbo is a common food either eaten raw or made into meal so that these plants are of the first use in this empire  vannunga vannunga on the river kan was a city of great size and splendour now a heap of ruins from an inroad of the tartars a melancholy sight to the numerous passengers who sail under its walls pekkinsa pekkinsa is the next city a most flourishing place which supplies the mariners with all kind of necessaries for their vessels  not far from thence are various specimens of several lofty rocky hills pierced hills cut or pierced through by human art into grotesque forms merely to please the eye those engraven by mr nieuhoff p    are pierced through in various places others have great flights of steps cut out of the live rock either to the summit or half way up round which a walk is conducted guarded by rails and forming a gallery beneath the impending remainder of the mountain  nangtchangfoo is a city seated in lat     0 nantchangfoo near the lake poyang which is about four leagues broad and thirty in length lake poyang abounding with excellent fish among which are many european such as sturgeon salmon carp chubs trout shads and lampries  about thirty miles farther to the north of nantchang the waters of the lake unite with those of the great river kyang which is continued from thence to the sea hootchoo the city hootchoo stands on the eastern bank of the junction a few miles up the river to the west is the city kyew kiang the rendezvous of the barks of many parts of the empire the river runs gently from hence to the sea with a course almost imperceptible but is at full and new moon affected by the tide  in the kyang near that city where the river is a league broad the fish whangyu is found the whangyu or yellow fish that often weighs eight hundred pounds it is remarkably firm and most excellent eating these fish are taken in certain seasons when they come out of the lake poyang into the river we cannot ascertain the species du halde vol i p     speaks of another he calls the chokyaryw or armor fish armor fish being covered with strong scales placed like tiles in the roof of a house i suspect it to be the esox osseus of linnoeus or the acus maxima squammosa of willughby hist pisc app    tab p viii this grows to forty pounds weight and is in high esteem  about fifty miles from the eastern side of the poyang lake kingteching in lat       stands kingteching on a plain surrounded with mountains and having a navigable communication with the lake by means of a river that passes by the city yauchew and is crowded with vessels which are continually passing or repassing either with the materials for the famous porcelain ware or with the porcelain itself which is manufactured in no other place in the empire than at kingteching  in the itinerary of mr nieuhoff tonglyu ufun tonglyu ufun anhing and teytong appear most delightfully seated on the river tonglyu bears numerous marks of the ravages of the tartars at ufun is a manufacture of arms famous throughout all the empire  the great city of nanking or nanquin nanquin in lat       0 is seated on an extensive plain near a league from the river but united to it by several canals capable of bringing up the imperial barks which are as large as middle sized ships this city was once the capital of china till it was removed to peking it was the chambdan of the nubian geographer on a river of the same name which he says p    was the largest in china the tartars made themselves masters of this city in      and before they deserted it burnt the magnificent imperial palace demolished the famous observatory and violated and destroyed the sepulchers of the emperors and other distinguished personages the city is reported to be ninety miles in circumference later surveys have made it only eighteen but it certainly had been of far greater extent much is now a waste and retains all the marks of the tartarian fury but enough is inhabited to make it a most populous and flourishing city of the parts which escaped the rage of the tartarian ravages is the porcelain tower porcelain tower a pagoda of nine stages of most exquisite workmanship and lined with beautiful tiles of porcelain from which it derives its name it is far the most beautiful in china mr nieuhoff gives a fine view of this curious structure as he does of one of the modern streets the signs and manner of building the walls of the city some of the gates and idol temples evince its former grandeur it is besides the seat of the literati and consequently abounds with fine libraries and is eminent for its booksellers shops paper ink and all that can feed the cacoethes scribendi it is not without other manufactures its fattins are in high request as are the woollen cloths fabricated here  nanquin is garrisoned partly by chinese partly by tartars the last commanded by one of their country they possess one part of the city and are separated from the other inhabitants by a single wall  about the year    0 the famous corsair coxinga came up the river with three thousand sail of ships and laid siege to the place it happened that on his birth day his army past the day with carousals and all sorts of festivity the garrison guessing that they should find the enemy buried in sleep sallied out surprised the camp slew multitudes and forced the rest to find security in their ships coxinga afterward fought and defeated the tartarian fleet and by his cruelty in cutting off the noses of four thousand prisoners sullied his victory  the passage over the kyang from nanquin was in the time of nieuhoff on a bridge composed of fourteen pontoons the pretty town of jejenjeen is on the opposite side yangchoo he entered soon after on the imperial canal and passed by yangchoo a great and populous city in lat       flourishing by its being the staple of the salt trade that useful article made on the seashores is brought here by the lesser canals and by the same means transported to most parts of the empire for they extend in many directions westward even to the borders of tartary the canal is continued northward on the side of the great lake kaoyeouhoo singular vessels the same which mr nieuhoff calls piexe here the forms of the vessels are very singular they are called longschon or serpentine and are used to carry fish quite to peking these are represented in form of a serpent from the prow issues the head on which is placed an idol with some live ducks pendent from the stern is suspended a boy who is playing all sorts of monkey tricks the masts are decorated with numbers of flags and serpents appear cut or painted in every part it is manned with rowers who with their broad oars not unlike paddles go with most astonishing celerity it is incredible with what expedition fish are conveyed fresh to peking even from distances of six hundred miles  the city of yangchoo is infamous for its traffic in women trade in women it produces the most beautiful in all china particularly for the admirable smallness of their feet and the symmetry of their bodies they are trained from their childhood in every accomplishment singing dancing painting and composing of verses but above all in the practice of every lascivious attraction these unfortunate women form a vast article of commerce and the merchant panders dispose of them to every part of the empire  the next city of note is kajutsiu kajutsiu then follows hoinganfoo seated on the river hoai near which are vast embankments to keep off the fury of the sea all this neighborhood is marshy yet extremely productive of rice the whole country may have been gained from the watery element yet it must have been many ages past for a field near hoingan is distinguished by the numbers of ancient tumuli many of the towns appear like venice built in the water and some even below  whaynganfoo in lat       is one whayngan it is built below the level of the great canal which is near that city supported by strong dykes here very properly one of those mandarines resides who has the charge of the canal and is called grand master of the waters not far from the west of it is the vast lake hongtsehoo which just below the city is discharged into the great river whangho or the yellow river which rises in lat river whangho    north amidst the mountains of the tartars of kokonor near the edge of the great desert shamo or gobi its course is about six hundred leagues and the current so violent that it is impossible for a ship to sail up the stream it is liable to great inundations insomuch that the inhabitants of the low province of honan are obliged to surround their cities at a small distance from their walls with a strong mound mr nieuhoff exemplified this in his plate at p     the waters are of a yellow color tinged with the strata they pass through which is the origin of the name this river in the neighborhood of whayngan notwithstanding its low latitude       its great breadth in that part of more than an english half mile and its violent rapidity is at times entirely frozen  the route to peking is continued through two other provinces shantung and petchelee the rich populous and commercial city tongchang is in lat       this city has also its porcelain tower being even externally made with that material and with little bells pendant at each angle of its eight towers which moved by the wind yield a pretty modulation  kyofew hyen is a city renowned for having been the birth place of the great confucius confucius where born so justly celebrated throughout the empire of china  mr xantsui nieuhoff mentions several other places in this province such as xantsui with the teywanmiao its remarkable pagoda not distinguished for its grandeur fine pagoda but for the great beauty of the workmanship it is rather low and square of a vast size and enclosed within a most extensive wall made of stone and the upper part of red and green tiles the temple itself is of stones mixed with yellow tiles the imperial color so resplendent as to appear like gold when shone upon by the sun it is besides richly decorated with dragons and various chinese chimerae the inside filled with monstrous idols on the back part is a garden delightful as that of paradise enriched with variety of fruits and flowers  jax hinno is a town distinguished by the multitude of square towers which rise in all parts jax hinno like our tower steeples whether they are for defense or belonging to pagodas does not appear  lintsinchoo is a city in lat       lintsinchoo distinguished by the multitude of vessels continually there in their passage to the capital or different parts of the empire as the great river euteo unites here with the imperial canal there is also a customhouse which brings in a vast revenue without the walls is a very splendid pagoda of nine stories the outside is of the very fine earth with which porcelain is made and richly painted  tetchoo the last city in the province of shantung tetchoo is seated on the river in lat       from hence we immediately enter into the province of petchelee the most northern in china the navigation is continued to tongchoosoo within a small distance of peking the latter part on the river peiho which flows from the northern capital of china into the gulf of petchelee  on the mountains near sinkosien grow the eaglewood trees and the calamba eagle wood both form great articles of commerce and are sold even in china at a large price but at still greater in hindoostan where so much is consumed by the gentoos for burning their dead near this city is a most beautiful octagonal pagoda consisting indeed but of three stages but admirable for the roofs of most exquisite workmanship  single and tiensingfoo are the next cities single and tiensingfoo the last is seated lat     0 on the conflux of three great rivers on an island formed at that spot is a most singular castle of a triangular form truncated at the top this is the greatest emporium in all china and strongly fortified in the manner of the country the resort of jonks and all sorts of shipping are incredible it being a port free from tribute the city is not large but the suburbs so extensive as to make it one of the most populous in the empire and are filled with palaces and pagodas nieuhoff imagines this city to have been the quinsay of marco polo bergerons coll p     which he says was like venice built on a morass the emperor he informs us had a magnificent palace here and adds that no less than six hundred thousand families were to be found in this vast place what is singular the neslorians had a church in the city a proof that christianity was tolerated in this empire in the thirteenth century  near joerwoe mr joerwoe nieuhoff went along another canal made in the river chaolcang he passed by focheen sansianswey and tongtchoofoo tongtchoofoo at the distance of four miles from peking the navigation ends the reason assigned for its not being brought to the walls of the city is that multitudes of the poor entirely subsist by the carriage of goods and the necessaries of life into the capital at this place the dutch ambassadors were met by a magnificent cavalcade of mandarines and people of rank sent by the emperor to do them honor and they entered the city in a most pompous procession after being treated with the utmost external respect they were dismissed without obtaining the end of their embassy  i shall not attempt the description of this magnificent city but will content myself with speaking to the eyes by the plates of mr nieuhoff which i believe represent with great fidelity the various cities pagodas and other buildings he passed by in these may be seen the different forms of houses and public edifices the splendour of the emperors palace and a general view of the city are shown in the    th page the pagodas the idols in various other pages and the customs and dresses of the inhabitants are most frequently exhibited in respect to the gardens of the chinese those of the private men are mentioned in the second volume of the chinese miscellany and those of the emperor most admirably described by le friar attiret painter to the reigning monarch in       i now return to the latitude of canton coasts of china and pursue the topography of the coasts by reason of the great rigor with which the chinese exercise their prohibition of trading in any of their ports except canton our knowledge of the shores or harbors is very confined we shall have very little to say of an extent of between two and three thousand miles of coast following the bending of the outline the whole of which appears strangely rugged with promontories divided by bays harbors and creeks  the ladrone isles ladrone isles and those of lema before the bay of canton are lofty rude and broken that of the asses ears takes its name from two hills that assume the form piedra biancas farther to the north is a very high rock of a white color both the last are marks to navigators  footchien the province adjoining to quangtung on the north footchien is a mountanous country but the mountains by the industry of the inhabitants are formed into amphitheatres with terraces which often extend several miles in length and a series of twenty or thirty one above the other the account given by du halde vol i     is so curious as to merit the attention of our readers these are planted with rice which is nourished by water forced up to a great height and conveyed to the different plantations in pipes of bamboo this province is remarkable for its vast commerce opulence and population and also for its amazing fertility  among the vegetable productions oranges it is distinguished for its fine oranges one is very large and its rind quite loose to the pulp which has the taste and smell of the muscadine grape this kind is candied and sent to all parts of the empire another is of a deep red and a third very small china is the native place of oranges from whence they were communicated to the western world  the lichi and longywen are fruits peculiar to the more southern parts of this empire lichi fruit of most exquisite flavor especially the first which has of late years been most successfully introduced into bengal  hyamen amwy or the port of amwy is an excellent road for ships in a deep bay beneath the shelter of the isle of amwy in lat       the island is flat and morassy and garrisoned by about six or seven thousand men before the prohibitory edict it was much frequented by european ships the dutch about the year      made a treacherous attempt on the place they came with five ships and landed about three hundred men who entered the town the greater part of the inhabitants fled but cunningly left in their houses abundance of spirituous liquors this proved the bait they intended the dutch intoxicated themselves to a great degree of this the fugitive citizens had notice they returned surprised the invaders in their sleep and put them all to the sword the chinese have preserved the history in large characters on the face of a smooth rock near the entrance of the harbor  on the isle of amwy is a vast rocking stone of forty tons weight moveable by the slightest touch rocking stone whether it is treated with superstitious respect as the britons did their logganstone hamilton does not inform us a stone of this kind is found in cachemire which the mullahs or priests say is moved by the miraculous power of the saint to whom it is dedicated  the great island of formosa isle of formosa or tawan as it is called by the chinese lies off the coast of footchien at the distance of about sixty miles from the nearest place the length is ninety leagues the greatest breadth about thirty it is of a curvated form with the convexity facing the continent the tropic of cancer passes over it at the distance of a hundred and five miles from the southern end almost dividing it in equal parts it is very singular that notwithstanding its proximity it was unknown to the chinese till the year    0 when a eunuch of that nation returning from the west was driven there by a tempest this was not immediately productive of any consequences nor did his countrymen profit of the discovery before the last century when in the reign of the emperor kanghi it was invaded by the famous coxinga who conquered at last the western part not for the empire of china but for himself at that time the kings of quangtung and footchien had revolted from the empire as soon as their rebellion was quelled kanghi in      was put in possession of as much of formosa as the young descendant of coxinga had power to yield  the japanese seized on this island about the year    0 the dutch in their way from japan about the year      made here a settlement the manner of obtaining it and their future expulsion has been given at p     of this volume in my account of their first commerce in these parts with the empire of china  the coasts of formosa are rude port of tawan lofty and rocky the principal port is that of tawan the same with that which the dutch took possession of near it is the capital city of the same name unfortified but garrisoned by ten thousand tartars and very populous to which the chinese who are a commercial people carry on a prodigious trade there are besides three other cities and several villages all inhabited by chinese the whole is remarkably fertile productive of grain and all the fruits which the correspondent parts of china afford as the whole of the island was inhabited by a barbarous people domestic animals are in some degree scarce oxen are in use for riding instead of horses stags abound and among the wild animals monkies but it does not appear that tigers or beasts of prey are known in any part of formosa  the island is divided from north to south by chains of lofty and inaccessible mountains natives of formosa the greater part of the western side is inhabited by chinese the natives have the eastern entirely to themselves those which continue on the western are not better than servants to the colonists except the inhabitants of three out of the twelve districts formed by the chinese which have revolted the formosans are a fine people and of remarkable swiftness which they attain by practice so that they can outrun a horse at full speed their shape is easy and slender their complexions olive and their hair fleck and hanging over their shoulders in the southern part of the isle they wear a linen wrapped round the middle and falling to the knees in the northern the skin of a stag made into a sleeveless jacket their bonnet is formed of banana leaves adorned with tufts of the feathers of cocks or pheasants  their morals have been much misrepresented by the chinese and the jesuits they have no external worship but a strong notion of a supreme being which renders them a quiet honest and benevolent race an inveterate hatred subsists between them and the chinese the last had reason to suppose that the island had its gold mines but as they could not discover them in their part they equipped a ship and sailed to the eastern they were received by the natives in the most humane manner invited on shore and furnished with every necessary in this visit the chinese observed in the poor cottages a few ingots of gold left negligently as if of no value this excited their avarice they made their hosts drunk and in their sleep cut all their throats and carried away the gold the incitement to this horrid action  it must not be forgotten of psalmanazar that the history of formosa was written by a person who pretended to be a japanese converted to christianity and to have fled from his country to avoid the dreadful punishment inflicted by the emperor on all proselytes he assumed the name of psalmanazar and is generally supposed to have been born in the south of france he was a man of uncommon abilities after leading a vagabond life through various parts of europe in which he acted the part of a most consummate impostor and suffering frequently the greatest misery from his profligate life he was reduced to become a common soldier in a scotch regiment at sluys there he first assumed the character of the japanese innes a worthless chaplain of the corpse undertook his conversion not through principle but the hopes of promotion on his arrival in england innes had discovered him to be an impostor but for their joint interest they united in the deceit psalmanazar formed a formosan alphabet he pretended to be converted in form was baptized by innes by the name of george and the credulous governor of sluys stood godfather innes had by his correspondence with the good compton the bishop of london been encouraged to bring him to our capital the prelate was made most completely the dupe of these villains psalmanazar had many patrons and many opponents but his abilities and impudence baffled all detection he undertook a history of formosa which he pretended was subject to japan a most fabulous composition yet as the english are always delighted with the mavelous it was so greedily bought up as to induce him to prepare a second edition innes attained his end got preferment and then basely deserted the cause of his promotion psalmanazar lived some time by various tricks and impostures at length at the age of thirtyeight he began to feel compunction at the infamy of his life and was struck with most sincere remorse he became a most lively penitent and applied his great abilities to useful learning he wrote his own life which was not to be published till after his death i believe it to be a true narrative and that he concealed nothing but his real name and the place of his birth fearing to leave reproach upon his family the list of his works many of which are on important subjects may be found in the gentlemans magazine vol xxxv p     he lived till august      when he died at the age of eighty having long led an exemplary life fully atoning for the irregularity of his early career  the isles of pongho form an archipelago off the western coast of formosa having the tropic passing over them isles of ponoho they are destitute of all the necessaries of life even to fuel so that every thing must be brought from formosa to supply the chinese garrison they consist of only rocks or sand yet as they possess a fine port which formosa is destitute of they become essential in the preservation of that great island the dutch built a fort at the entrance of the harbor of which nothing except the name remains the chinese remember it by that of the fort of the red hairs it was the famous coxinga who took these islands from the dutch and kept them for his own use  the province of tchetchiang continues the maritime parts of china from footchien this like the rest tchetchiang is amazingly commercial remarkable for its rich silks embroidered with gold and silver for its timber vast forests of the useful bamboo for its mushrooms hams and the vegetable tallow salt salt is made in abundance along the shores and serves to cure the quantities of fish taken on the coasts which are packed in barrels and sent to the more distant provinces the salt itself is transported to several of the internal parts within any reasonable distance but those which border on tartary are supplied from certain salt pits providentially given for the use of the inhabitants for many interesting particulars relating to the preparation of salt in china the reader is reserted to sir george stauntons account of the embassy vol ii p  0 e   this province provinces gained from the sea and that of kyangnan are supposed to have been gained from the sea as holland was by the dutch the period is not justly known the tradition of the chinese is that there had been a mighty deluge in all probability that of noah du halde du halde vol i p     attributes to the emperor yau the vast works which recovered these provinces from the sea i will not dispute the learned jesuits skill in chronology but the emperor began his reign in      before christ and reigned a hundred years the period in which he was born could not therefore have been long after the universal deluge  le poivre also informs us that these provinces were some thousand years ago covered with water and regained from the sea by the industry of the inhabitants the immense mounds which guard it from the fury of the waves are stupendous marks of the power of labor exerted by a most populous nation they exceed all the similar dikes of holland besides they have a much more powerful sea to resist than that which beats on the coast of the european low countries montesquieu attributes to the industry of the natives of these two provinces their superior fertility to any in the chinese empire  in lat isle of chewshan  0 at a small distance from the coast is the island of chewshan or as we call it chusan mentioned in this volume at p     as the first settlement the english had in china it is surrounded with many little isles the remotest of which constitutes the most eastern part of the great curved shore of the empire  at the bottom of a long estuary stands the city of ningpo ningpo or limpo known to the europeans by the portuguese name of liampo or limpo it is seated in the midst of a fine plain cultivated like a garden surrounded with hills and divided by a principal canal branching from it with sixtysix others on one of these canals between shauhingfoo and this city is an example of the singular method of passing from one level to another and seemingly a very awkward one embassy to china vol ii p   0 and plate    of the solio volume e  the waters of one canal not being on a level with that of another the boat by means of two capstans is hoisted upon a stone glacis or slope which being made slippery with water the boat glides down into the second canal as swift as an arrow out of a bow for this reason they are made in form of gondolas with keels of a wood hard enough to sustain the weight of a bark these boats are proper only for carrying goods from ningpo and the towns depending on it as far as the canal of shauhing they differ much both as to size and make from the imperial barks which would be broken to pieces or at least receive some considerable damage in the descent  ningpo carries on a considerable trade with batavia siam and japan the portuguese had early a settlement in this city where they acquired immense wealth and with it all the vices attendant on riches insolent and highly debauched profligacy of the portuguese they dared to seize the most beautiful young girls they could hear of and employed a set of profligates for that purpose when they had kept these poor victims as long as they thought proper they returned them to the unhappy parents enraged at this the chinese cut off a party of the infamous chasseurs the portuguese had the audacity to complain the affair was brought before the highest tribunal and such scenes of iniquity were discovered that a decree was immediately made that the portuguese should instantly quit the empire thus says hamilton vol ii p      ended the most opulent colony at that time in the world  to the north of this city an open bay runs deeply westward into the country the vast estuary of the river tchentangtchiang the great city hangtchoo stands at some distance from its discharge into the bay hangtchoo on a spot where the river is a league broad here is carried on a great manufactory of silk as the province is distinguished for the cultivation of the worm in hangtchoo sixty thousand workmen live within the walls and several hundred thousand in the adjacent country  near this city is a most beautiful little lake called sihu sihu lake about two leagues in compass the water quite crystalline causeways are made through it for the convenience of walkers and elegant open halls raised on posts for the amusement of the citizens it is full of the famous golden fish golden fish which show to great advantage among the leaves and flowers of the nymphaea with which the lake is filled this favorite fish of the chinese is found in many other provinces here it forms a species of commerce the spawn and fry being transported to all parts of the empire which do not produce them  the golden fish is of the most vivid colors linnaeus names it cyprinus auratus the gold is highly resplendent but varies in part of the same fish into the brightest silver or richest blues which can be imagined it seldom reaches the length of eight inches commonly is much smaller has one dorsal sin which sometimes is wanting and the back marked by one or two small protuberances in many the tail is most remarkable being so formed as to exhibit the appearance of two and even three tails mr edwards tab  0  and bloch iii tab    give figures of the varieties they have been introduced into all parts of europe and will not only live but multiply prodigiously in our little stews  du halde gives the following account of the treatment of them in china the next thing remarkable says the accurate historian is the kinyu or golden fish these are kept either in little ponds made for that purpose wherewith the houses of pleasure belonging to the princes and great lords are embellished or else in basins that commonly adorn the courts of their houses in these basins which are more deep than wide they put the least that can be found for the smaller they are they think them the more beautiful besides the greater number may be kept of them and they afford more diversion  the prettiest of them are of a curious red speckled as it were with gold dust especially toward the tail which is forked with two or three points some are of a silver color others white and some spotted with red both sorts are extraordinary lively and active delighting to play on the surface of the water but then their smallness renders them so tender that the least impression of air and even any violent shaking of the vessel will kill great numbers of them those that are bred in ponds are of various sizes some are bigger than our largest pilchards they teach them to rise up to the top of the water at the noise of a clapper which the person uses who feeds them what is most surprising is that according to all accounts the best way to preserve them is to give them nothing in winter it is certain they do not feed them for three or four months at peking while the very cold weather lasts what they live on in the mean time under the ice it is not easy to understand except we suppose either that they find little worms in the roots of herbs which grow at the bottom of the ponds or else that pieces of roots themselves being softened by the water become proper food for them but those which to prevent their being frozen are taken into the houses and kept all winter in a chamber often shut up in a china vessel without being fed at all are toward spring put into the basins again where they sport with the same strength and agility as they did the year before one would imagine they knew their masters and those who carry them food by their being so ready to rise at their approach the greatest lords themselves delight in feeding them with their own hands and spend some time to observe their nimble motions and sporting in the water  from the estuary of the tchentangtchiang the land bends toward the northwest province of kyangnan the next province to tchetchang is kyangnan on the southern side of the entrance into the bay of the great river leading to nanquin isle of tsongming is the island of tsongming ninety miles in length in the breadth about twenty it was originally a sandy spot overrun with reeds to which it was customary to banish robbers and all kinds of profligates necessity compelled them to industry they cleared the ground sowed the few seeds they brought with them and by the assistance of some chinese who came from the continent to settle among them made a barren land fruitful other families arrived the island was divided among them and the shares granted in perpetuity on the payment of a small yearly rent of the produce of their labor it is at present well stocked with buffaloes and hogs and bears the usual grain and fruits of the neighboring continent among the last it is remarkable for its fine peaches  the approach to nanquin is now very difficult the channel being obstructed by sand so that the greater ships cannot enter the chinese possibly might remedy this but it is supposed they wished rather to promote their inland trade than launch into distant commerce  the great and rapid whanghohoo also empties itself into the ocean near the northern boundary of this province river whangho some leagues farther opposite to the little isle yuntayshan in about lat       begins the province of shantung from thence the land changes its course and trends to the northeast as far as chinshanwey the correspondent coast to china all the way from the mouth of the yellow river is the kingdom of korea and the intermediate space is named whanghay or the yellow sea the promontory of shantung advances greatly yellow sea and forms the entrance into the gulf of pecheli which is bounded by part of the province of shantung of pecheli and of lyauting a portion of chinese tartary and finally by the western coast of korea  within the gulf in lat       tenchoofoo is the city and port of tenchoofoo on the part of the province more salient toward the north a number of small isles stretch out still further this port is a very fine one and has a strong garrison and fleet to guard the coast  among the productions of this province is the famous worm producing the silk mentioned by pliny lib vi c    silk of pliny  which that naturalist with other ancient writers believed to have been a vegetable combed from the leaves and branches of trees i vindicate his opinion so far as to say that it was collected from a plant but he was ignorant that it was the produce of an insect du halde vol i p  0  gives an account of its history but leaves us in the dark as to the species of insect which yielded this kind of silk speaking of a certain sort of silk manufactured at trinan a city of this province he says that the stuffs named kyenchow incline to a greyish color which is produced only by the wild worms resembling caterpillars these worms spin their webs on shrubs and bushes and furnish as great quantities as the domestic worms this silk is the more estimable as it costs in a manner nothing and so strong that the goods made of it are very lasting and have a tolerable vent every where  the gulf province of pecheli from tenchoofoo retires far toward the south then returns northward and in lat       begins the province of pecheli which in lat    takes a northcastern direction and on the gulf finishes this great empire in lat  0 the capital peking is about a hundred miles from the mouth of the peiho tiansin port of peking on which is tiansin the port of the capital the river flows far to the southwest out of the lake tayhoo a canal joins it about thirty miles from the sea and receives the vessels which are to discharge their ladings near to the imperial residence this province was conquered in about      from the tartars by taytsu the first emperor of the dynasty of myg he took the capital peking in one day erected the country into a sovereignty and vested it in his fourth son  the empire ends about   0 miles farther in lat  0    great wall here begins the celebrated wall completed two hundred and twentyone years before christ by the emperor tsingchiwhung to protect the northern parts of china from the incursions of the tartars it appears first in the very sea on a vast bulwark founded on a number of ships sunk by a wonderful weight of huge stones to render immovable the terminating superstructure the wall is all the way from twenty to twentyfive feet high generally cased with brick and terrassed at top of a breadth sufficient for five or six horsemen to ride abreast it passes along the frontiers of the provinces of pecheli shansi and shensi is guarded by a series of square towers or forts at proper intervals of only two bowshots asunder and has its gates often of a vast size with rooms adjacent fitted up as places darmes and peculiarly well garrisoned at no great distance in several cities general officers are posted with considerable bodies of troops the generalissimo resides at kanchoo many of these cities are the magazines for the articles of commerce brought from different parts to be transported into the various provinces of the empire  this great protection of china is not uniformly built of the same materials in some places the walls and even the forts are of earth in the district of ninghya a few leagues from the city of the same name the mountains are so high and precipitous as to supply the necessity of a wall for the space of ten leagues in other places it is carried along vast and rugged mountains almost inaccessible yet the fears of the chinese urged them to prolong their defense even over the sides or summits of these alps which direct its course according to the nature of the country over deep valleys or level plains in a certain tract a great trench is cut to supply the place of the wall and on the banks of the fierce river whangho or the yellow are series of sentryboxes filled with soldiers who keep watch night and day as the wall must in its course pass over various great rivers arches or bridges of a stupendous height and strength are thrown over them  later emperors second wall to give greater security to their capital have built a second wall at some distance from peking as strong as the first it is called the great inner wall and unites with the other by wenwhafu near it is a city which rises and falls with the form of the mountain it is built on and amazes the spectators with the boldness of the structure  the length of the wall in a strait line is seven or eight hundred miles and allowing for the windings for the ascents over the craggy mountains or descent into the deep valleys may be estimated at double that length yet what may justly excite our admiration is that this stupendous work was said to have been completed in the space of five years in this empire of obedience every power was exerted to perform the commands of their common father issued forth for the common security  immediately beyond this bulwark begins the country of the ancient liautong liautong or part of that of the manchew tartars the last conquerors of china and who gave the present imperial family to the throne the gulf of liautong runs deeply into the north of the country from the foot of the chinese wall this territory has also its guard but no better than a precinct of palisadoes with a few mean gates the capital mugden which the manchews look on as their metropolis has a tartarian commander in chief and is inhabited by multitudes of chinese who carry on the trade of tartary just without the gates are the magnificent tombs of their ancient princes paper made of cotton is a great manufacture of this country its principal use is for the sash windows of the palaces and houses of men of rank in peking those of glass have not reached even the cold latitude of so splendid a people gingseng gingseng the celebrated medicinal plant of the chinese is found in this country and many parts of chinese tartary of korea and even in the provinces of shansi and honan in china itself but the latter is of an inferior kind it grows on the steeps of wooded mountains or rocks and on the banks of deep rivers the root which is applied to use is said to be of the shape of a man there is not a physician of eminence but who has celebrated its virtues and exactly in the style of our empyrics it fortifies says shichin the noble parts keeps the body in good plight fixes the animal spirits cures the palpitations occasioned by sudden frights dispels malignant vapors clears the sight opens and dilates the heart and strengthens the judgment when it is taken a considerable time together it makes the body light and active and prolongs life in a few words there is not a disease incident to the human body but what it infallibly cures the manchews style it orhota the most noble or queen of plants others the golden well bordered with precious stones there are extant nine ancient receipts and sixtynine modern gingseng the value of the root increases it was formerly worth its weight in silver at present says du halde vol ii      it is sold for nearly its weight in gold  in   0  when the great kanghi was on one of his progresses into his manchew dominions he was desirous to give his favorite tartarians a valuable perquisite and sent ten thousand of his soldiers to collect all the gingseng they could find each was to give him two ounces of the best and to receive for the remainder an equal weight of fine silver they sallied forth and collected in the year twenty thousand pounds weight but suffered sufficiently for they were allowed neither tent or any sort of covering and the places of search swarmed with tigers those who did not return on the signal of moving their quarters were supposed to have been devoured by those dreadful animals  in the chinese dominions gingseng grows between the thirtyninth and fortyseventh degree north latitude and between ten and twenty east longitude from peking but is not confined to the old world it was discovered in canada in   0  by m sarrasin who sent specimens to paris it was introduced into england in    0 by the worthy peter collinson and now flourishes in kew garden linnaeus first called this plant sion ninsi afterward panax quinquefolium ehret in true tab   names it araliastrum and catesby appendix tab    aureliana canadensis after lafilau doctor woodville i   0 retains the linnaean name  in america it is not confined to canada in america also it is found even as far south as virginia gronov fl virg      being discovered on the shady hills and valleys of that state toward the end of the last century by doctor john clayton the six indian nations call it garangtoging or the human thighs the europeans have imported a great deal into china but it is not in the same esteem says osbeck in which the roots of the chinese dominions are held the indians of america do not apply them to any use but multitudes are employed in collecting them for sale to the merchants of quebec our physicians depreciate the virtues of this root so much that notwithstanding it has found a place in our dispensatory yet is not mentioned in the pharmacopoeia of the london college the power of the medicine may possibly have been exaggerated in china but i never can believe that a root so universally esteemed in that empire for ages can be destitute of virtues father jartoux speaks highly of its qualities from his own experience and on the very spot phil trans abrig iv part ii p      to him i give full credit but at the same time shall observe that the trial he made was from the fresh roots the experiments on which the english physicians founded their opinion were from dried and exhausted specimens  adjacent to the eastern side of liautong is the peninsula of korea korea extending from lat     0 to lat    bounded on one side by the gulf of pecheli and the approach to it on the eastern by the japanese gulf japan extends the whole length of the coast and even stretches beyond its southern part korea is of an oblong form about a hundred leagues in breadth its greatest length extends a hundred and eighty its situation it lies between three mighty nations so that the inhabitants are a mixed people but call themselves of tartar origin boast of great antiquity and produce some books which are two or three thousand years old they have been conquered by the chinese japanese and tartars since the conquest of china by the latter their yoke has been light they only are obliged to send four ambassadors to peking annually to perform homage where after their audience from the emperor they remain in a state of confinement till their return the chinese fear that some time or other they may unite with the russians who have advanced far toward the chinese frontiers this may occasion a revolt and the consequences prove fatal to the repose of the empire  korea had its wall to the northwest which has long since been in a ruinous state but even when complete did not prevent the conquest of the country by the manchew tartars  the korea is mountainous and not very fertile except the vales it is full of woods and produces most of the european fruits and foresttrees the southern part yields rice and excellent grain it breeds a hardy race of horses exclusive of a small variety not three feet high also cows and black swine abounds with various animals among others are numbers of tigers the skins of which are a considerable article of commerce in their intercourse with japan among the noxious reptiles are crocodiles of an enormous size  they have great quantities of feathered game and a variety of birds possibly many of those we have described in the arctic zoology as belonging to the tartarian or siberian world but the species of the pheasant kind with feathers of the tail three feet long are confined to this country the feathers are sent from korea an article of commerce to various parts of the chinese empire  the natives of the northern part are a fine race of men tall natives robust active and without any of the tartarian aspect those of the southern part resemble the chinese of a sallow complexion and tender constitutions  their government is regular government and its customs and laws resemble those of the chinese this makes it likely that their origin may more safely be derived from china than tartary the chinese pretend that they were subdued as early as the reign of yau eighth emperor from fohi which may well account if true for the similitude of laws and customs their rulers are absolute and sole masters of the land which is granted to every man according to his family but the personal estate descends from father to son their religion is that of fo with all its superstitions they are very fond of literature and have triennial examination of doctors bachelors and masters of arts these adopt the pure doctrine of confucius and despise the ridiculous idolatry of fo  the koreans of rank are very splendid in their habits wear fur caps and brocade clothes and affect purplecolored silk richly ornamented with gold and silver furs are much in use the learned are distinguished by two feathers in their caps  the productions of the country are ginseng cotton paper productions gold silver iron mineral salt the skins of sables and beavers and a beautiful varnish which resembles gilding made from the gum of a tree  the natives carry on a great commerce with china trade about sixty merchants attend the annual ambassadors they travel in march and cross the ice of the gulf in sledges so severe is the cold even in this latitude others go in august in large vessels discharge their cargoes in the chinese ports and carry it by land to peking they bring with them great quantities of the window paper umbrellas fine mats tobacco striped cotton furs and dried fish taken from a large shell on the coast of japan this dried fish is only a covert to the other articles of commerce they import besides great quantities of gold and silver in ingots and part in spanish pistoles and carry back prodigious cargoes of raw and fine silk which they manufacture at home thin silks the kind called by the chinese kaolitoanza or korean damask tea vast quantities of cotton china ware and white copper vessels of all sorts  that penetrating writer mr campbell has given an excellent account of the commerce of this people my plan is of that confined nature that i must content myself with a reference and request the readers perusal of mr campbells vol ii  000 account in his collection of voyages which will amply repay them  the koreans trade openly with china with china etc clandestinely with japan the phillippine isles and perhaps java under the general notion of their being chinese they may traffic in disguise to many other places their trade with the nations to the north and northwest and probably with the russians of their asiatic dominions comes under the same description all this is strictly prohibited by the chinese emperor who even keeps a mandarine at the korean court to take care that the order be observed this precaution with so corrupt a nation has very little effect  the intercourse to the north russians is the most dreaded by the chinese the russians have made great advances on that side and had formed settlements on the amur which runs through the northern part of the empire this brought on more than one war the koreans are said either to navigate the river songor or the schingal till they arrive in the amur or to sail along the coast and proceed directly up its mouth and trade either with the subjects of russia or possibly with the russians themselves all the intervening track from korea is affectedly given wrong by the chinese in order to keep both their own subjects and those of russia in ignorance but in vain the koreans are a match for them in cunning they pretend in their voyage up the amur that they come from some distant isle ysbrande ides informs us of this but without knowing that they imposed on him they trade even with the manchew tartars subjects of the emperor but these people for gains sake content themselves with the deception from them and from the russians or russian subjects they procure the quantities of furs which they pretend are the produce of their own country  the koreans having their country three parts surrounded by the sea must naturally be a naval people they trade commonly with japan and obtain the articles of commerce of those islands with japan the japanese have ceded the little intermediate isle of susima the tuitatao of the koreans on purpose to facilitate the trade  by the pretense of sailing to the island of quelpraet seated to the south of the peninsula to take in the chinese manufacture from the magazines formed there they proceed on the east side of formosa manilla and to manilla where they trade under the name of chinese and by this means acquire such quantities of spanish silver they likewise get abundance of ducats in japan exchanging their ingots for specie with this silver they pay for great part of the manufactures of china  they do not purchase any european goods in china yet korea abounds with those of our distant world these are procured in the phillippines or at batavia spices and several other insular commodities are bought in the same market from that of manilla they bring amethysts and emeralds the last certainly from the mines of atacames manta and santafe ulloa vol i     0   in spanish america their intercourse with the oriental islands must have been long for mr campbell observes that the people who were so cruelly murdered by the dutch in amboina in the year      for the pretended conspiracy with the english were koreans and not as they are called japanese but there is no limiting the period of trade among these distant nations forward as we have shown them to be in the arts of navigation  i shall conclude the account of this singular country with a view of the adjacent nations whether dependent or independent on this mighty empire  the kingdoms on the south are tonquin and laos nations adjacent to the chinese empire ava thibet a small part of pegu advances a little into the southwest and the northern end of ava borders on the lower part of the province of yunan thibet is adjacent to the provinces of sechwen a great part of shensi and the upper part of the last is bounded by hokonor tartars in their country is a large lake of the same name in lat       these tartars have among them a coarse woollen manufacture which they dispose of to the chinese inaccessible and rude mountains lie to the south of that people inhabited by a most savage race so as to cut them off from all intercourse with the still more southern countries  let me here introduce some account of the celebrated drug of rhubarb the rhubarb of which tartary and china is the seat the rhubarb of all the medicinal kinds is found in great abundance in several parts of the chinese dominions and even in china itself in the province of sechwen in the mountains of snow in shensi where troops of camels are laden with nets full of rhubarb in the months of october and november it abounds also in tanguth about the lake kokonor little bucharia and all the chain of hills from lake baikal westward it grows south as far as quangtung but the southern rhubarb is little esteemed yet much of it comes to europe by sea i may add that out of the chinese empire it is found in thibet  rhubarb was known to dioscorides who lived in the reign of nero as a valuable purge and paulus aeginetus a physician of the seventh century prescribed it for the same purpose it was brought from the remotest parts of the ancient scythia and the use was continued through all succeeding ages without any certain knowledge of the plant to which the roots belonged marco polo observed it on the rocky mountain near suchur in the province of tanguth and says it was sent to all parts of the earth for it found its way to europe from those distant regions even in that early time  gerard p     gives a figure of the well known rhubarb of our gardens with roundish crisped leaves this he names very properly rha verum antiquorum parkinson gives another p         in his paradisus terrestris which he procured from doctor matthew lister physician to charles i this is acknowledged from both their accounts to be weaker than the other kind which came from china it is frequent in our gardens i do not remember that the roots were ever applied to medicinal uses but of the tender shoots of the leaves are made excellent tarts in the early summer not inferior in taste to the codling  the plants which produce the true rhubarb have been but lately discovered the seeds of the rheum palmatum were sent from russia by the late doctor mounsey to doctor hope of edinburgh in      he sowed them in the botanical garden they succeeded greatly and he with his usual liberality communicated them to the curious he drew up an account of the plant and inserted it attended with most accurate plates in vol lv p   0 of our phil transactions doctor woodville gives also a good figure of the plant at p     of his medicinal botany as to that referred to by linnaeus le bruns travels i p         it seems of some other species of rheum the rheum rhaponticum cultivated in our english gardens f   that most excellent character the duke of athol cultivated in scotland propagated it with great success not only in his garden but on the highland mountains that surround his seat at athol his benevolent design of rendering common and cheap this useful medicine is blessed with the utmost success the roots which he cultivated in the light soils similar to those of the tartarian deserts the native place increase to a vast size some when fresh have been found to weigh fifty pounds and to be equal in smell taste and effect to those we import at an enormous expense to our country on being dried they shrink to one quarter of their original weight there is reason to suppose that the scotch rhubarb may be superior in virtue to the foreign the last being gathered in all seasons as the mongall hunters chance to pass by they draw up the roots indiscriminately pierce them at one end sling them on their belts and leave them to dry on their tents without further care in all probability the time is not remote in which the british rhubarb will supersede the necessity of the use of the foreign  but there are other kinds which are said to be equally efficacious with the rheum palmatum such as the rheum rhabarbarum of linnaeus the undulatum of the hortus kewensis with long waved leaves the rheum compactum a third species boasts of the same virtues miller had the seeds sent to him as those of the true kind the rheum rhaponticum is besides met with in tartary about lake baikal as well as most of the others this is the species which gave the name of rhubarb or rather rhabarb to this drug the plant being first observed near to the banks of the ancient rha or river volga the same prescribed by paulus aeginatus as one of the ingredients for a purge under the name of rheum ponticum perhaps the trivial might be derived from its being brought from some part of pontus to which it was carried from its place of growth pliny lib xxvii c    mentions a plant with a medicinal root called rhacoma he says it came from the countries beyond the kingdom of pontus and by the name probably from the rha he describes its uses but none of them are similar to that of the rhubarb i cannot therefore venture to say that it is the same plant  in chinese tartary the bobak marmots hist quad ii no     are said to be the propagators of rhubarb wherever ten or twenty plants grow you are sure of sinding several burrows under the shades of their broad spreading leaves it is probable the manure they deposit about the roots contributes not a little to its increase and their casting up the earth makes it shoot out young buds and multiply it appears that the mongalls never accounted it worth cultivating but that the world is obliged to the marmots for the quantities scattered at random in many districts of this country for whatever part of the ripe seed happens to be blown among the thick grass can very seldom reach the ground but must there wither and die whereas should it fall among the loose earth thrown up by those animals it immediately takes root and produces a new plant  the chinese call rhubarb taywhang they use it nearly in the same manner as is done in europe esteem its virtues much as we do except that which comes from canton the greatest part of the tartarian or most valuable is engrossed by the russians who purchase it at their town of kiachta a little south of lake baikal from bucharian merchants and send it to petersburgh this is called the turkey rhubarb because formerly it was brought from constantinople the merchants there receiving it from the bucharians who now find a readier market near home the chinese prohibit the exportation of the best rhubarb under severe penalties but much of it is procured either by concealing it mixed with roots of inferior quality or by a contraband trade the russian government is very attentive to the business and appoints at kiachta persons to inspect the drug and to reject all that is bad  all this extensive tract has a most elevated situation elevated country giving rise to numbers of great rivers which running southward water the several parts of india both intra and extra gangem the ganges itself is one the burrampooter or tsampoo of the chinese another with the various contributary streams that fall into those amazing rivers the river of arrakan may be added to the list as to those of ava pegu siam and cambodia each of them originate in the south of china the elevated plains of this part of asia did not escape the notice of marco polo for he mentions his journey of twelve days over one called pamer bergeron p     and asserts that he found on those heights the fire to burn with difficulty by reason of the excessive cold and rarefaction of the air these plains are on the north of cashgur and to the west of little bucharia  the immense deserts of gobi or as the chinese call them deserts of shamo shamo and hankai are dreadful boundaries to the north and northwest of the chinese dominions they consist of sands that move with the winds like the current of a river nature has formed three passagesacross them by means of three chains of mountains which run from the great tartary and are mixed with pleasant valleys amidst these oceans of sand travelers who take any other course are liable to be overwhelmed with the torrents of sand equally dangerous with the deserts of arabia the first of these communications is in lat    north to the e n e of peking the second to the east of the province of shensi and the third in lat    to the east of hami on the frontiers of thibet by these means a safe access was given from the vast tartarian regions and through them from the countries bordering on the caspian sea and more remotely from europe itself they were the roads of the travelers and merchants of the middle ages  adjacent to the southwestern parts were some important cities well known to those adventurers hierkin cashgur such as hierkin and cashgur already mentioned in this work outlines of the globe vol i p    to which ptolemy gives the names of comedae and casia regio the first is supposed to have been cashgar the capital of casia regio hierkin the carcham of marco polo p    is conjectured to have taken its name from its situation on the aechardes a river which runs from the northeast and was remarkable as a station which merchants trading with the seres had in the very neighborhood in the time of our great traveller the inhabitants were mahometans intermixed with a few nestorians  hoton or coton hoton a province to the southeast of hierkin bordering on the desert is supposed to have belonged to the ancient chatae it is very populous the inhabitants are commercial cultivate cotton peym flax hemp and wheat and make wine peym is another province productive of chalcedonies and jaspers the capital of the same name is in lat    these places and many others mentioned by polo are to be found in the modern maps  lop the city visited by marco polo lies in lat    lop and is seated on a lake which gave name in his time to the great desert at lop the travelers always stop to provide themselves with mules or strong asses and provisions for their toilsome journey over the barren waste which takes a whole month marco polo seems to have crossed it in the most difficult part for the entire tract consisted of unstable sands or rugged mountains uninhabitable by even birds or beasts with scarcely any water and that usually bitter at length he arrived at the city of sachion the modern shatcheu at the entrance into the kingdom of tanguth  not far from thence is camul camul a city to be found in the old maps polo celebrates the great kindness of the inhabitants who on the arrival of any strangers immediately surrender to them their wives and houses and retire for the time to other habitations he adds that mangu khan shocked at the indecent custom directed them to build inns for the reception of the travelers this these contented cornuti took in such ill part that they never rested till by presents and remonstrances they prevaled on the khan to revoke the edict  further in lat       long  0  from greenwich karakarin stood karakarin the holin of the chinese the capital of the ancient mongois founded before the twelfth century or the time of jenghiz khan it was previous to his reign an inconsiderable place and the residence of ung khan of the karaites when jenghiz wrested it from him the conqueror improved it greatly and his son oktay khan rebuilt it with great splendour about the year      ten years afterward he surrounded it with walls of no better materials than of mud but his palace called wangan was of great magnificence rubriquis p  0  and    gives a full account of it to his master he informs us that william the goldsmith was employed in the ornamental work the famous silver tree in one of the courts was in a fine taste silver tree at the foot of the tree were four lions the same number of gilt serpents twined round the stem and their heads appeared out of the branches pointing different ways spouting various liquors one of wine another of caracosmos or the liquor of mares milk the third made of honey the fourth of rice and each fell into a great silver cistern placed beneath on the summit of the tree was an angel with a trumpet which sounded by the help of a pipe blown by a man artificially concealed all this showed taste in the khan as well as beauty of design in the artist this city placed in the middle of the desert on a salient chain of mountains might well astonish the traveller with its population and the splendour of its palaces these parts of tartary were about that period full of opulent cities but little more than the site of them or of karakarin itself was discoverable by the jesuits who were employed by the emperor in the vast work of the survey of his tartarian dominions the labors of the fathers regis fidelli and many others are comprised in twelve maps in the second volume of du halde in the third sheet is shown the situation of this once famous city and in some of the others the whole of the desert which lies in the chinese territories the chains of communication are expressed and the roads which the more hardy travelers ventured over amidst the trackless sands  the part of this desert which is clamed by the chinese begins in lat    north and in long      0 east from paris winds toward the northeast as high as halter gobi halter gobi in lat    and long     after running southwestward to the borders of india it skirts thibet the country of the kokonor tartars and then the borders of the far projecting province of shensi these tracts were known by the almost obsolete name of the once potent kingdom of tanguth tanguth rubruquis and marco polo traveled through and describe its flourishing state and the number of its cities the friar is the first who mentions the ox with a tail like a horse covered with silken hairs the grunting ox hist quad i no   since his days fully verified polo in his road to tanguth passed through the great desert which he names that of lop during night says he the caravans are terrified with the delusions of demons which haunt these horrid sands the travelers must be careful how they stray for they will imagine themselves to be called by their proper names by some of their comrades till they are brought to the edge of a precipice and sometimes they will be entertained with aerial music superstitions fitted to the dread of the place  it afterward passes between the country of the calmucs and the kalkas to the northwest the ortus tartars and the mongols to the south and concludes its course of above two thousand miles from the borders of india to halter gobi its remotest extremity the extreme point to the southwest is not distant from the lakes lanke and mansaroar the sources of the ganges and the lake which gives origin to the great burrampooter  even these deserts do not want inhabitants some pittance is found amidst the sands to support the takija or wild horses the dshikketei wild mules and asses or wild mules and the koulan or wild ass i refer the readers to p       vol i of my history of quadrupeds for an account of those curious animals  the chinese empire in tartary extends to the north as high as lat       its most western limit is not far from the southern end of lake baikal in lat     0 and long  00  0 west from greenwich it passes southward with some irregularity to the kingdom of thibet and has on that side as a difficult limit the great desert of shamo the northern boundary runs from the spot defined near lake baikal eastward for some space then turns northward along a vast and lofty range of mountains the more ancient seat of the mongols and at their extremity not far from the source of the river aldan in lat       bends to the southeast and concludes in the sea in lat     0 to the north of the river amur all the tract between these lines and the empire of china proper are inhabited by tartars subject to or under the protection of the chinese government for the further explanation i refer to my friend the reverend william coxes russian discoveries page  00  and mr arrowsmiths map of the world but above all to the travels of father gerbillon and other jesuits who followed the progresses of the great kanghi or were employed in the actual survey of his vast empire their travels are given in the second volume of du haldes history of china  the boundaries were settled in      by the treaty of nertshinsk treaty of nertshinsk upon the river ingoda in the reigns of john and peter afterward surnamed the great and that of kanghi the politic russians had long been endeavoring to make themselves masters of the important navigation of the river amur which in time might have given them the command of the japanese and chinese seas this the chinese foresaw attacked and took a fort called albasin built by the russians they levelled it to the ground and carried the garrison prisoners into china this brought on an embassy from the russians gallowin governor of siberia was the ambassador attended by a most splendid train so san captain of the life guard and minister of state and tongue jauye maternal uncle to the emperor were ambassadors on the part of the chinese both men of the highest rank and to them were added four others of the first distinction the cunning of the chinese was assisted by the subtlety of the jesuits for kanghi added to the negotiators father gerbillon and father pereyra the chinese ministers had a suite inferior indeed in magnificence but what gave the greater weight to the negotiation was that the wise kanghi had added ten thousand men besides the escort and which were attended by a fleet of seventysix vessels each carrying a piece of artillery the russians had fixed on albasin as the place for settling the business but to their surprise the chinese appeared suddenly before nertshinsk or as they call it nipchu encamped near the place and the whole business was transacted under tents all this gave argument irresistible the treaty was concluded the chinese offered to swear to the performance on the crucifix gallowin chose that they should swear by their own gods and both couched the sacred appeal in these terms imprecating the divine vengeance on the faithless party we ambassadors extraordinary of the two empires having been sent to settle the bounds of both dominions and establish a solid and perpetual peace between both nations which we happily executed in the conferences held by us in the seventh moon of the   th year of kanghi near the town of nipchu by distinctly setting down in writing the names of the countries and places where the two empires join each other have by fixing the bounds of both and ordering in what manner such disputes as may fall out for the future are to be treated of have mutually received an authentic writing in which is contained the treaty of peace and have agreed that the said treaty with all its articles shall be engraven on stone to be fixed in the places appointed by us for the bounds of both empires to the end that all who pass by those places may be fully informed thereof and that this peace with all its conditions oath of observance may be for ever inviolably observed but should any one have the thought only or secret design to transgress these articles of peace or breaking his word and faith should violate them out of private interest or from the design of exciting new troubles and rekindling the fire of war we pray the supreme lord of all things who knows the bottom of mens hearts not to suffer such people to live out their days but to punish them by an untimely death  i may here remark the observance of two very ancient customs in the execution of this treaty a roman form the one in the manner of the oath which agrees with that in use among the romans of which polybius has lest us the following form made on the occasion and which remained in his days cut on tables of brass in the temple of jupiter capitolinus in the archives of the aediles  the first of these treaties was confirmed by oath in the following manner the carthaginians swore by the gods of their country and the romans by a stone agreeably to an ancient custom and by mars enyalius the ceremony of swearing by a stone was thus performed the person that was appointed to this office having first solemnly attested the public faith for the due observance of the treaty took in his hands a stone and pronounced the following words  if i swear truly may the gods be propitious to me but if i think or act any thing that is contrary to my oath then let the rest enjoy in safety their country laws possessions household gods and sepulchers and let me alone be cast out from the society as this stone is now cast away at the same time he threw away the stone hamptons polybius book iii chap iii p       the other custom was one of the earliest date on this very continent columns memorial that of preserving the memory of any remarkable transactions by pillars of stone thus we find in genesis chap xxxi v     that the treaty between laban and jacob was confirmed and perpetuated by the erection of a pillar and a heap of stones the chinese ambassadors raised two pillars on the spot to determine the boundaries of the respective empires and on them engraved the treaty  it was the intention of the russians to have made the amur the limits of their empire river amur this vast river is formed originally by the junction of the onoa and the schilka to the west of nertshinsk from thence it flows easterly takes a vast bend southernly and then returns to the northeast and falls through a mouth four or five leagues wide into the lower part of the sea of ochotzk opposite to the great island sachalin in lat    the tartars call the river sachalin ula or the black river the chinese helong kiang or the river of the black dragon and the russians the amur it was first known to them in      by means of some cosacks sent on an expedition toward the river witim according to du halde vol ii p      it is navigable for large barks for the space of five hundred leagues  the russians were charmed with the discovery of a river which report made to fling up gold and silver and its neighborhood to abound with the most precious sables cattle fruit and grain and its inhabitants to be clad in nothing but damask and gold brocades in short it was represented as a land of canaan the russian colonists of the neighboring places migrated thither in crowds and depopulated their former country they founded a fort in lat    fort albusin which they called albasin the chinese jaksa from the river near which it was seated the chinese burnt it in    0 but it was resounded and at length strongly garrisoned till it gave such serious cause of jealousy to that nation as to bring on the treaty which occasioned its total demolition it is no wonder that they were alarmed the borders of the river were remarkably fertile had numbers of large cities and a most populous territory besides the mountains to the north were productive of the richest sables and other furs and inhabited by a hardy race of hunters had the russians rendered themselves masters of the amur even katherine the moderate might have made the chinese tremble for the fate of peking itself  the chinese had several places on the argun of some importance such as aigun or as it is called by them aigun sachalin ula choton near the junction of the seja with that great river a fort from which they detached their fleets against the russian encroachments tondon is another town in lat  0 where the cold begins with great severity as early as the beginning of september later in the year the greatest rivers are frozen over tigers inhabit even these high latitudes this country was visited and surveyed by some of the missionaries by order of kanghi whoever wishes to gratify his curiosity farther may consult du halde vol ii p     and the following pages  the country is full of forests the missionaries were nine days in passing through one they observed that the inhabitants of usuni made use of sledges drawn by dogs and persons of rank have sometimes a hundred to relieve each other on long journies on the snows or frozen rivers the river of usuri du halde vol ii map the sixth  which rises far to the south and falls into the amur abounds with fish mostly of species common to europe these serve the ypi tartars for food and raiment ypi tartars they are very ingenious in dressing the skins which they dye of various colors cut them into shape and sew them so neatly that they appear like silk sturgeons swarm in these

break into the great chain which extends quite from the first of the malayan to the kuril isles already described in the above work  the islands called by mr arrowsmith the tatpin tatpin isles form a numerous group of small isles dependent on those we are just going to mention they lie not remote from the eastern side of formosa with the tropic of cancer passing over the southern end  the isles of liquejo or as they are called by the natives riuku isles of liquejo are the next they are seventy leagues to the northeast of formosa the most considerable kintschin which lies north and south between latitudes       and       is about fifty leagues long and fifteen broad the east side and south end skirted by numbers of little isles and rocks the inhabitants are chiefly chinese who fled from the tartars at the time of the last revolution they were well received by the natives who speak a broken chinese which argues their descent so that the new comers were considered as countrymen they are principally husbandmen and fishermen and are a most cheerful happy people diverting themselves after the labor of the day with a glass of rice beer and with their musical instruments which they take into the field with them a few centuries ago these islands were conquered by a prince of satzuma a province of japan who governed them by his lieutenants they still remain in the same state of dependence but are taxed with much gentleness the inhabitants also send annually to the emperor of china a gift in token of loyalty and submission they carry on a commerce with satzuma and visit it once a year they have there a company of merchants but are confined in their commerce to that port and limited to the value of their trade but by the connivance of the japanese officers they dispose of an infinitely greater quantity than the law admits they import into satzuma all kinds of silks and stuffs and various chinese commodities which they carry over in their own jonks and some of their own produce such as corn rice fruit and pulse and a sort of brandy made from the remainder of their crops they bring great quantities of the cypraeae monetae cypraeae monetae or cowries the same

in pots and a few other matters of a trifling nature notwithstanding these people are really subject to the japanese they do not allow the emperors supremacy yet like them they have a dairi or

japanese islands extends to  0 the longitude from     to     east the coasts are rude and rocky the circumambient seas raging with storms during nine months of the year stormy are shallow filled with shoals and rocks and extremely subject to frequent shipwrecks off this coast are two whirlpools dangerous and not less tremendous than those of the famous maelstrom near the norwegian shores there are frequent instances of ships being absorbed in the vortex and their shattered fragments slung up at the distance of many leagues the poets of japan make constant allusions to these horrible phenomenon  the climate of the japanese isles like that of great britain is very changeable and subject to frequent rains fertilizing the ground as they do that of our island thunder is frequent and earthquakes so common as never to be minded unless attended as has been often the case with dreadful consquences  the summer heat is very great heat and scarcely tolerable when not alleviated by the winds it sometimes in july and august raises fahrenheits thermometer to  00 the cold on the contrary is excessive and sinks the mercury many degrees below the freezing point especially when the winds blow from the north and the east in the northern parts there are mountains scarcely ever free from snow  the whole empire is mountanous soil level meadows are unknown the fields of the valleys consist of a

china to preach his doctrine to the inhabitants it seems he was a sort of pope in india the twentyeighth in succession from the founder of eastern paganism he had vowed the greatest austerities particularly a perpetual watchfulness nature worn out was obliged at length to submit to the refreshment of sleep on finishing his slumbers he cut off both his eyebrows which had dared to close and flinging them on the ground each became a shrub darma eat some of the leaves and to his great surprise found himself invigorated so as to undergo any labors or any watchings he communicated the virtues to his disciples and tea became of universal use it is therefore styled by some the eyebrows of darma he is represented as a horrid ugly fellow with vast eyebrows wrapped in a great cloak and standing on a reed on which he had been wafted from region to region  we may be certain from this tale that the tea plant was aboriginal of china it is cultivated by sowing not in whole fields but round the borders in rows so that it may not hurt the land good farmers manure the plants with human ordure in seven years time it grows to the height of a man its few leaves at that time are gathered the shrub cut down and the most plentiful harvest is obtained from the vigorous shoots of the succeeding years  the leaves are gathered by laborers peculiarly brought up to the business they must not be taken by handfuls but pulled off one by one the trees are not stripped entirely for there are three gatherings in the year the leaves are sorted into three parcels the finest the small tender primaeval shoots are reserved for princes and great men and on that account called imperial they are next prepared by drying over the fire in an iron pan and after that rolled with the palm of the hand on a mat in order to fold them public laboratories are built for the purpose all the processes are given at large by kaempfer see also stauntons embassy to china vol ii p       tea is in as universal use in japan as in china and taken two ways the most common is similar to the european or rather the mode we learned from the orientalists but the manner of taking it is attended with the utmost ceremony the art is called sado and tsianoi we have our dancingmasters etc and in my time m vestris gave lectures to our quality on the manner of eating gracefully their soup the japanese

flowering state this is not to be wondered at when we are informed by reed mal v i p    that it does not flower till it has attained the age of about sixty years and what is very remarkable sheds its leaves a month previous to the time of flowering and immediately after having perfected its fruit withers and dies  the small slender walking canes so much admired for their elegant rings are obtained from young irregular suckers or shoots of the bambo which spring from the root after the main stem has been repeatedly cut down nature has not formed them precisely of the figure in which we receive them they are originally crooked and pliant and much art is used by suspended weights attached to them and the application of smoke to render them strait and stiff it is farther necessary to retrench with a knife the fibers which adhere to the rings and were intended by nature to propagate the plant in the same manner as the triticum repens couch grass multiplies its offsets by shoots from the joints  this species of walking stick is distinguished from the rotang or true cane not only by its singular protuberances but also by a small perforation extending through the center of the whole length of it which is common to all bambus and in their mature state enlarges into spacious cavities rendering this inestimable vegetable subservient to a thousand useful domestic purposes it is only in the island of japan that the bambu is thus artificially prepared for the purpose of a walking cane and constituting a lucrative article of commerce it is counterfeited at surat upon the malabar coast and a spurious sort made of a different wood imposed upon the ignorant the name of bambu is not indian but was given to this plant by europeans as expressive of the violent explosion that comes

so fond of these animals as to cause huts to be built much respected and provisions to be found for them in every street the utmost care was taken of them during sickness and when they died they were

a cavern on its south eastern side into which the waters rolled with an awful and tremendous noise in regarding this stupendous rock which stood alone in an immense ocean we could not but consider it as an object which had been able to resist one of those great convulsions of nature that change the very form of those parts of the globe which they are permitted to desolate  some kaempfer i  0  tin

dear as copper most sorts of instruments are composed of that metal and of brass but they are wise enough to make their culinary vessels of a composition of iron  coals abound in japan coals but notwithstanding the severity of the weather in winter the inhabitants chiefly use charcoal placed on ashes in a great pot so prepared as to prevent any noxious effect from the fumes  that useful article salt is made from the seawater salt filtrated through sand and then boiled to a proper consistence and calcined in earthen pots  naptha is frequent in one part of japan naptha the natives collect and burn it in their lamps instead of oil  sulphur abounds in an island called iwogasima or sulphur isle sulphur near the province of satzuma kaempfer gives a curious account of the place it is says he not above a hundred years since they first ventured thither it was thought before that time to be wholly inaccessible and by reason of the thick smoke which was observed continually to arise from it and of the several specter and other frightful uncommon apparitions people fancied to see there in the night it was believed to be a dewlling place of devils till at last a resolute and courageous man offered himself and obtained leave accordingly to go and examine the state and situation of it he chose fifty resolute fellows for this expedition who upon going on shore found neither hell nor devils but a large flat spot of ground at the top which was so thoroughly covered with sulphur that wherever they walked a thick smoke issued from under their feet ever since that time this island brings in to the prince of satzuma about  0 chests of silver per annum arising only from the sulphur dug up there besides what he gets by the trees and timber growing along the shore  vulcanoes are to be found in many parts of the empire vulcanoes which in general abounds with their great pabulum sulphur and metallic bodies some have burnt incessantly for ages others have ceased or only emit flames periodically the most noted is the mountain fesi in the province of surugu equal in height to the pike of teneriff and capt with everlasting snow  no country is more subject to earthquakes than japan earthquakes so frequent are they that the natives regard them with as little terror as a european would a storm yet no annals can produce such tragical relations of their sad effects that in      told by father de frocs preserved by kaempfer is one but dreadfully surpassed by the earthquake of   0  when the whole city of jeddo was destroyed and two hundred thousand of its inhabitants perished in the ruins  in many places are springs of water most intensely hot hot springs some boil up with such violence as to fling up the largest stones which are laid over them we are not told to what height they are said to be periodical so i suspect them to be of the same nature with the geysers of iceland those of a gentler heat are used as baths for several disorders those of the boiling heat were formerly applied as i shall have occasion to mention for the most cruel purposes  the empire of japan consists of three greater islands nipon the largest nipon which gives name to the whole is of a curvated form and approximates at the southern end to the southwestern extremity of korea between both are the streights of korea and within is the great gulf of the same name bounded on the eastern side by the concavity of nipon according to m danvilles scale that island is above six hundred miles in length  the next island is that of sikokf or the country of four sikokf because divided into four provinces it is irregular in its form and lodged between two large projections of nipon its length is two hundred miles  between its eastern end and the west of the salient part of nipon awad is a smaller island named awad  the third or more southerly island is separated from the western part of sikokf by a narrow strait and is named saikokf saikokf or kiusiu or the western country and kiusiu or the country of nine because divided into nine provinces  around most of these greater islands are innumerable small ones inhabited or uninhabited among them firando and gesima are the most celebrated as having been the seat of european factories and distinguished in history  the japanese islands were certainly visited visited by marco polo in the thirteenth century by the famous marco polo he describes the riches of the country in high terms and says that the emperors palace was covered with plates of gold and that the seas abounded with fine pearls of a red cast he adds that the inhabitants were idolaters and worshipped monstrous images with the heads of beasts and with many hands and that if they took any foreigner who was able to ransom himself they let him go otherwise they killed him and with their friends made a feast on his body  marco polo travels p         gives a long account of the imprudent invasion of this island by the great tartarian emperor kublai khan the siu tsu of the chinese du halde i      about the year      who sent there his general argas with a most numerous army and vast fleet the greater part of his ships perished in a tempest and all the men who escaped to shore were massacred by the japanese so that very few returned to give any account of the misfortune the chinese never more attempted the empire of japan  that country cannot properly be said to have been discovered by the europeans till the year      discovered by the portuguese by three portuguese named de mota zeimoto and peixolo these as i have before mentioned in common with the rest of their countrymen instigated by avarice had sailed from malacca in search of an imaginary spot called the island of gold driven by a hurricane they were wrecked on the shores of japan the lord of the district received them with great humanity and signified an earnest desire of entering into a commerce with a nation which he flattered himself would be so advantageous to him and his subjects  it was at this period that francis de xavier francis de xavier the great apostle of the indies was deeply engaged in his mission in the peninsula of malacca his fame had reached japan when a native of the country determined to make a visit to that part of india to be satisfied of the truth of the wonders reported to have been wrought by de xavier he came attended by two servants was converted to christianity and adopted the name of paul of the holy faith so zealous was he in his new religion that he may truly be called the apostle of japan de xavier determined to attend him to his native country he associated with him two jesuits sailed and landed in      at kangoxima in the kingdom of satzuma on the southern part of the island of kiusiu and soon after passed to firando a small island where he assisted by paul made converts innumerable introduces christianity his zeal then determined him to visit the emperor at the royal city of miaco he arrived at the court and was received with much respect the multitude of proselytes was incredible the benevolence and humanity of our religion were the principal instruments with which the missionaries operated on the minds of the people who compared the conduct of the christian preachers with that of their own bonzees the last suppose that all sick and infirm people are the objects of the wrath of heaven and constantly leave them to perish the missionaries observed the precepts of our savior they fed the hungry clothed the naked and administered to the sick these irresistible proofs of the superior excellency of our doctrine gave success to their labors for near a century the true religion flourished and spread more and more over the empire other circumstances concurred to facilitate the reception of the gospel in japan the bonzees preached the necessity of mediators in their xaca and other gods they underwent long and severe fasts and mortifications and both christians and japanese agreed in the worshipping of images in the monastic life in beads processions praying for the dead and even auricular confession  the jesuits were followed jesuits etc as occurred in china by crowds of dominicans franciscans and augustlines to assist in the harvest the holy men soon fell into the same error as in that empire they quickly began to quarrel with the jesuits accused them of avarice and of temporizing with the vices and superstitions of the japanese let the reader peruse p    of this volume and he will learn the imprudency of all these religious adventurers  the vast profits resulting from the commercial and worldly spirit of the jesuits were one cause of the toleration which the christian religion experienced for so great a length of time the emperors saw the wealth the europeans brought into their country and as long as the christians did not disturb the peace of the government they permitted the conversion of their subjects and the exercise of our religion the portuguese settled at first at the harbors of bungo and firando and afterward at nagasaki only they carried on immense trade and in one year exported not less than three hundred tons of gold from miaco the emporium at that time of all their commerce in this part of the world in the year      when their trade was on the decline they even sent from that town    0 chests of silver  the dutch introduced themselves into japan about the year   00 established their first factory at firando and obtained from the emperor a patent for a free commerce the deep enmity between them and the portuguese soon began to show itself and each nation took every possible means to supplant its rival in the year      an opportunity offered conspiracy the dutch happened to take a portuguese ship in which were found certain letters from a captain moro to the portuguese ministry at lisbon wherein he had laid a plan for murdering the emperor and reducing the empire to the power of his countrymen moro was a japanese by birth chief of the portuguese in japan and very zealous for the christian religion the letters were carefully transmitted to the emperor moro was empaled and burnt alive after a little time an edict followed which entirely banished every foreigner from the empire with the most rigid prohibition of their ever entering it again a persecution was raised against the christians persecution perhaps the most horrid that ever was known it lasted forty years and thousands perished by the most dreadful torments it was computed that above a third of the people of the empire were professors of christianity the punishments those miserable creatures underwent are not to be related the inventions of hell itself must have been put to the stretch if any one has the strange curiosity of being acquainted with them he need only turn to ogilvys history of japan p      which he will probably shut with the same horror as i did let me only add that the boiling water mentioned by me at p     of this work was one of the instruments of torture varied and lengthened by the most diabolical inventions those of singok were the most horrible they flow with vast violence and noise beneath a lofty precipice and emit the most noisome sulphurous vapor which rises to a great height hither the christians were brought in multitudes and in case they refused to renounce their religion were carried bound to the summit of the mountain and precipitated into the subjacent phlegethon  in order to impress on every subject a detestation of the christian religion treading on the crucifix and possibly to discover if there be any latent favorers of its doctrine the following annual custom is preserved throughout the empire people of all ranks and periods of life even to children of a certain age are assembled in the different places where they perform the ceremony of trampling upon the cross it was even said to have been a rite exacted from the dutch as the price of their commerce with the japanese swift in his voyage to laputa is humorous on the subject for when gulliver under the character of a dutchman petitions the emperor to be excused the ceremony his majesty much surprised tells him that he was the first of his countrymen who ever made any scruple and that he suspected he must be a christian and not a hollander dutch in      the dutch sent a solemn embassy to the emperor then resident at miaco and were said to have at that time obtained an advantageous commercial treaty at length they fell under the general edict of expulsion yet even after that severe decree procured readmission under most mortifying restrictions they virtually are compelled to renounce their religion they must give up their prayerbooks on first landing and relinquish during their whole confinement every mark of christianity but what will not a dutchman do for gain they make from the factory an annual journey to the emperors court which they dignify with the name of embassy but it is no more than a compulsory visit to present their gifts their manner of traveling both on their way and on their return is under a strict guard more like that of a parcel of convicts than the merchants of a great commercial nation one ship only is permitted to trade with this empire annually and that is confined to the port of nagasaki in the little isle of desima on the west side of the island kiusiu in fact this is the only secure harbor in all the mighty empire of japan as soon as a vessel arrives a japanese guard is put on board the number size age and complexion of the crew noted down every living creature in the vessel is to be accounted for a monkey died and the coroners inquest sat on the body the next thing done is to take an exact inventory of and to cause all the sails masts ropes rudder guns arms ammunition etc and all the tackle of the ships to be conveyed into the emperors warehouse there to be kept under lock and seal till the time comes for their departure when they are restored according to the inventory taken of which both parties have an exact duplicate some of these precautions thunberg says are now omitted e   the factory is imprisoned in the little island the whole year factory excepting during the six weeks of open trade when the japanese come there with their goods erect booths and have all sorts of amusements smuggling smuggling even of the most trifling articles is forbidden under pain of death kaempfer history of japan i   0 assures us that three hundred were executed for that crime only in six or seven years time two were put to death while he was in the island and the factory obliged to attend their crime was no more than smuggling one pound of camplior  the articles imported by the dutch trade imports are raw silk from china tonquin bengal and persia and from the same countries all kinds of stuffs silks and woollens provided they are not wrought with gold or silver various sorts of the cotton manufactures of india but not painted woollen cloths stuffs and serges from europe buffalo and deer hides from siam and cambodia tanned hides from persia and bengal pepper sugar cloves and nutmegs from india or the spicy isles gumlac sandalwood camphor from borneo catechu storax liquida saffron and costus coral cinnabar antimony lead saltpetre and borax looking glasses which the japanese break to make spying glasses magnifiers etc files needles and various sorts of iron ware from europe large drinking glasses spectacles toys curiosities natural and artificial and strange birds of all kinds once the dutch brought a cassowary it was considered as a bird of ill omen and the owner was obliged to send it back  in return the dutch obtain exports during the six weeks fair gold silver and copper bullion japanned cabinet and other works porcelain tea and japanese camphor and also copper in bars and other forms these constitute the sum of the traffic which on the whole is far from considerable ever since the abolition of christianity in the empire the abbe raynal estimates the whole annual commerce at little more than fortyfive thousand pounds  the first time that the english traded directly with japan english was in      when captain saris entered the port of firando he met with the most courteous reception from the king of the island saris was charged with letters and presents from our commercial pacific monarch james i to his imperial majesty of japan after a short stay at firando he proceeded on his journey to surunga where the emperor at that time kept his court a most honorable answer was returned and privilege of trade granted to the english throughout the japanese empire saris then made a visit to the emperors son at jedo the history of these transactions is given by purchase pilgrim vol i p         and is well worth consulting saris found at firando william adams an englishman who by a strange chance was flung on this island and detained there ibid p        till his death he was of no small use to saris as an interpreter saris established a factory at firando till the general expulsion of the europeans the dutch excepted  the french in the time of colbert french were desirous of partaking of the advantages of the japanese trade that great minister proposed sending a number of huguenots who might safely swear that they were not of the same religion with the portuguese but the jealous japanese rejected the request  the chinese had once prodigious commerce in this empire chinese and came and settled in any numbers they pleased but in time the jealous japanese took umbrage at the vast concourse of those foreigners and at length confined them to a certain precinct near the same island with the dutch they are allowed to have three sales in the year one in spring when they are permitted to dispose of the cargoes of twenty jonks a second of thirty jonks and a third in autumn of twenty all above the number are obliged to return without being suffered to unlade  the religion of the japanese is idolatry their deities their deities are amazingly numerous tradition says that they had been men eminent for their piety or mortification deified after death for their several virtues they also hold that their earliest emperors were gods and demigods and that during the first period they were governed by seven great celestial spirits each of which reigned a certain but immense number of years their temples are very numerous dispersed not only over the cities but even the mountains and deserts their idols assume a thousand extravagant forms and colossal sizes in one of their temples is an idol of copper gilt the very chair it sits on is seventy feet high and the head so large as to be capable of containing fifteen men many of them work miracles and bring abundance of gain to the temple or monastery which possesses such a treasure  a temple near miaco takes its name from its number of idols which amount to       doctor kaempfer gives us a view history

the monasteries are filled with regulars and seculars like those of the church of rome some lead most austere lives others indulge like the plump benedictines others are accused of great irregularities  there is one order of singular austerity that of the jammabos i e the mountain soldiers they in one sense answer to our military religious being bound to fight for the gods and religion of their country but never have degenerated into the voluptuousness of the knights of the european orders they pass their time amidst the holy mountains and practice the greatest mortifications the richer live more at their ease in their own houses this order is now divided into two sects one called jofanfa the votaries of which bind themselves to ascend once a year the great mountain of fikoasan a journey of vast difficulty by reason of its heights and dreadful precipices but still more tremendous on account of the penalty attending any impure person making the attempt he infallibly is possessed by the devil of the mountain and becomes stark mad the other sect is named fonsansa this likewise is obliged to make an annual pilgrimage to the summit of the omine a mountain not less terrible than the other but should any one presume to ascend it without being duly prepared by purification he is certain of being flung down the precipices or seized with a lingering illness the penalties of his neglect  the japanese religion is split into a multitude of sects various sects each differ in some tenets yet all agree in five indispensible commandments   they are not to kill or eat of any thing that is killed   they are not to steal   nor to lie   nor to commit adultery   nor to drink wine is it not evident that they brought with them on the dispersion of mankind some of the mosaical laws and in the last that they had adopted the rite of the rechabites  japan has its peculiar language language different from all the asiatic and probably the primitive one brought over by the colonists who originally peopled the islands and came directly from the banks of the euphrates on the dispersion of mankind after the confusion of languages the japanese have an opinion that the primoeval emigrants settled in the province of isje numbers therefore make a pilgrimage annually to the ancient spot the place where their ancestors dwelt and as such honor it with peculiar acts

probably brought with them a pure monotheism which was afterward converted into polytheism by their intermixing with the several nations which subsequently contributed to the population of japan because it is reasonably believed that empire received a vast increase of inhabitants by the numerous shipwrecks on its stormy coasts and likewise by migrations from the neighboring china and korea whether the vast reverence which the japanese pay to their parents was copied from the chinese or whether it might not have been introduced by the primoeval colonists as a part of the first great code of laws the fifth commandment i will not pretend to determine  japan is governed by two emperors government secular one called the cubo or secular monarch who rules with absolute power all the princes and great lords of the empire pay him the most servile obedience formerly the whole was divided into small independent states the rulers were styled kings and princes many of which retain the names and govern absolute enough but entirely under the direction of the emperor  the ancient title of the monarch was dairo he was also sovereign pontiff and like the pope the supreme head of the church in that character his person was held so sacred that little short of divine worship was paid to him for a long period he governed by means of a prime minister who was called the cubo a dignity usually bestowed on one of his younger sons the father like other eastern monarchs devoting his whole time to indolence and sensuality at length a cubo arose who dethroned the dairo or rather usurped his more important office that of secular emperor he permitted him to retain that of pontiff ecclesiastical the cubo thus stripped him of all sort of power except ecclesiastical but preserves the farce of paying him all external respect as much as if he had enjoyed the ancient plenitude of authority he renders him an imaginary homage and pretends to act only as his deputy and to hold the empire from him  the dairo was permitted to reside in the palace in the old imperial city of miaco and to keep up the ancient state but that is now done with difficulty as the cubos have successively lessened the revenues still he reigns supreme over the church the people pay him the utmost veneration and the cubo himself is obliged to marry one of his daughters in case he has any that are marriageable the first cubo who usurped the empire retired to jedo which is the other great capital of the island  the laws of japan as is told of those of draco severe laws may be said to have been written in blood montesquieu observes that it is to supply the great defect of the religion of the country in its ignorance of the doctrine of future rewards and punishment almost every crime is punished with death and punishments and often attended with the most excruciating torments crucifixion is very common sometimes the malefactor is crucified erect sometimes with the head down i have little doubt but that these punishments were unknown in the empire till the propagation of christianity the ideas were taken from the crucifixes of the christians and from the pictures of the suffering of our savior the mode in which death was inflicted on the apostle st peter probably gave rise to that variation of cruelty in japan  the punishment for gentlemen and soldiers is ripping open the belly as a peculiar favor they are sometimes permitted to be their own executioners the emperor sends his mandate the person whom he so favors receives it with the utmost respect makes a great feast and on the conclusion puts the imperial order in execution in the very presence of his friends and family  from the variety of feature and form of body in the japanese of the several provinces it is evident they are descended from different races of people who have migrated or have been cast on the coasts at various times thus says kaempfer i    although the japanese in the main particularly the common people of nipon be of a very ugly appearance shortsized strong thicklegged tawny with flattish noses and thick eyelids though the eyes stand not so deep in the forehead as in the chinese yet the descendants of the eldest and noblest families of the princes and lords of the empire have somewhat more majestic in their shape and countenance being more like the europeans the inhabitants of the provinces satzuma oosijma and fiuga are of a middle size strong courageous and manly otherwise civil and polite the same is observed of the inhabitants of some of the northern provinces in the great island nipon excepting those of the great province osju who are said to be beyond others cruel and unmerciful the inhabitants of some provinces of saikokf particularly of fisen are short slender but wellshaped of a good handsome appearance and extremely polite the inhabitants of the great island nipon particularly of its eastern provinces are known from others by their big heads flat noses and musculous fleshy complexion  kaempfer hist of japan i    relates isle of blacks that some centuries ago the japanese discovered the island of genkaisima situate to the north of nipon and inhabited by owi or black devils and that after extirpating them they peopled the isle with a colony of their own these blacks are described in the ancient chronicles of japan to have worn long hair spread over their shoulders and to have had strange household goods and highcrowned hats kaempfer justly imagines them to have been malayes wrecked on that island those people are remarkable for wearing their hair of a great length and as to the hats they most probably were european and among the articles imported into the malaye islands which in old times were brought over land to ormuz and from thence dispersed by sea to the peninsula of malacca siam and other places  notwithstanding the japanese have for ages scarcely known the pest of war manners yet they are endowed with the greatest heroism if in any quarrel they have been conquered by an enemy and find they cannot revenge the insult they will put themselves to death i speak of this not in praise but to describe a high spirit bordering on brutality that spirit exerted in a foreign land against the treachery of peter nuyts the dutch governor merits our admiration and applause univ hist vol x p     kaempfers japan vol ii app     to fill the catalogue of their vices they are distrustful proud cruel and destitute of benevolence and from the doctrine of their bonzees are so insensible to the wants of their fellow creatures as to suffer them to perish by denying them every sort of relief to their intrepidity may be added their patience under labor their ability to undergo any hardships their other virtues are numerous they have great industry great moderation in their pleasures are entirely free from luxury and intemperance moderate in their desires of wealth just in their dealings and true to their word chaste in word and action religious but apt to deviate into the grossest superstitions  they are celebrated for the quickness of their apprehensions and facility in learning before the arrival of the missionaries their acquired knowledge was at a low ebb what they attained after that period may possibly be lost at that time they were very ignorant astronomers astrology but much addicted to judicial astrology they undertake nothing without consulting some pretending impostor geography as to geography they made the world consist of three parts china siam and japan we may see by their maps their extent in that branch of science we have one as a proof in the british museum  their skill in physic is not less moderate physic their great art is that of the pulse the physicians first feel one arm and then another as if the impulse did not come from the same machine the heart their aesculapius or apollo is the god jakusi they have very few remedies two form the principal the one is the acupunctura or pricking with the needle acupunctura in use for a dreadful species of colic common in japan the professors in the art make use of certain needles and form with much ceremony and superstition the punctures in three rows kaempfer ii app p    tab     but this operation is applied for the cure of other disorders a singular coincidence with the chinesepractice mentioned by dr gillan embassy vol ii p     e   the other great remedy is the moxa moxa a caustic applied in almost every distemper it is made of the leaves of the artemisia vulgaris and being set on fire is placed on the part affected the flame is not visible nor is the burning attended with any considerable pain the astrologers are consulted on the occasion who have figures of the human body drawn like the man in the almanac with all its parts marked to which the moxa is to be applied kaempfer ii tab     for the physicians seem to act with peculiar reverence to the influence of the stars  this remedy is also in use in india and other countries in asia it has even been introduced into europe as a cure for the gout but i believe with such little success that the practice has long since been exploded  the japanese have another medicine a famous powder a powder to be taken internally in colicky diseases the inventor had the art to give out that it was communicated to him in a dream by jakusi the god of physic which stamped such a veneration for this medicine that he enriched himself so greatly as to build a temple with part of his gains and the family who keep the nostrum to themselves have erected two or three more the chief ingredient is supposed to be the china root great quantities of which and also of the ginseng root is imported into japan for medical purposes  botany is much studied by the physicians of the empire and many books are composed on the subject dr thunberg met with two physicians at jedo who had great knowledge not only in their own profession but in botany mineralogy and zoology  the famous terra japonica or catechu is prepared chiefly at odowara catechu the principal ingredient is foreign being an extract from the mimosa catechu woodvilles med bot vol ii p     tab     a small tree which grows in great plenty on the mountains of hindoostan not the areca catechu as had been long supposed we were first favored with this discovery by mr ker assistant surgeon in bengal much is manufactured in the province of bahar an ointment is composed from it of general repute throughout india being found a most useful astringent in that hot climate it has for a great length of time kept its place in our dispensatory as an efficacious medicine in weakness of the bowels in general and the consequential fluxes it has also been used with much success as an antiseptic in cases of a putrid dissolved state of the blood by the great physicians huxham and pringle in japan it is sold perfumed and made up in various forms for the use chiefly of the ladies who hold it in great esteem to fasten their teeth and give a sweetness to their breath  the japanese are fond of good paintings paintings and the rich will give immense prices for pieces of merit as to their own artists they are on a level with those of the chinese but excel us greatly in the beauty of their colors  their cabinetworks japan works and the several things which go under the common name of japan are well known for the excellency of the varnish which surpasses that of all the world the black also is most intense and the coloring or painting exquisite as to the brass furniture of the cabinets it is very coarse and clumsy but the japanese excel in iron manufactures steel their metal is of the best quality their arms are muskets bows and arrows daggers and scymitars the last of a most remarkable temper it is customary to try the edge on the bodies of executed malefactors which they cut to pieces by way of experiment  when i am on the subject of arms army i may mention the military of the empire it is computed that the standing army consists of a hundred thousand foot and twenty thousand horse in a kingdom which can have no foreign wars nor fears intestine tumults this is surprising but since the conspiracy of the portuguese and the extirpation of christianity the emperors have been in constant fears of plots and invasions from the european powers  let me now return to the arts printing printing has been among them from time immemorial like the chinese they cut the letters on blocks of wood but excel them in neatness they print and write like that nation in this art and in several others as well as in customs there is such an agreement that i cannot doubt but that the chinese were their original instructors in science but as is often the case the scholar has excelled the master  they also claim the invention of gunpowder gunpowder but remain inferior to the chinese in its uses not only in artillery but in all species of fireworks  the architecture of the japanese resembles in some degree that of the chinese architecture it is much more plain being not laden with ornaments as that of china the common houses are small consisting of two stories the upper of which is seldom inhabited and the rest is almost destitute of furniture except mats and a small table to eat on the cedar juniperus virginiana fir and the bamboo are the great materials for building their mirrors are made of metal but never used but at their toilets the windows are covered with a white paper thin enough to admit the light  the castles of the nobility consist of three different enclosures castles one round the other and are defended by a deep ditch but never by artillery they are usually at the skirts of large towns the owners are bound to keep them in repair  the temples are often very magnificent temples and some are peculiarly remarkable for the height of the roof the elegance of the sculpture and beauty of the gilding and painting  here are considerable manufactures of silk and cotton silk and cotton the produce of their own country but the dutch are allowed to import a great quantity of cloths stuffs chintzes and cottons  the dress of the better sort of people are silk of the lower habits cotton their habits are loose gowns with large sleeves in summer they are thin in winter quilted and often they put on one or more additional according to the severity of the season the womens apparel resembles the mens only the gowns of the former are much longer and trail on the ground men of rank also wear trowsers and short black jackets placed over their gowns they use sandals but do not wear stockings and always go bareheaded except in a journey when they put on a conical cap of straw at other times they protect themselves from the sun and rain by fans and umbrellas  the manufacture of porcelain is of great antiquity porcelain   i conclude the account of japan with a very brief mention of the two capitals of which miaco is the most ancient miaco and the original seat of empire the plan is given by kaempfer hist of japan vol ii tab     copied from the original now deposited in the british museum by which it appears most regularly built the streets crossing each other at right angles it lies in about lat     0 north in a large plain surrounded with beautiful verdant hills and mountains and watered by numbers of small streams miaco is the residence of the dairo or ecclesiastical emperor and is full of manufactures of all kinds being the chief mercantile town in the empire here the richest stuffs with gold and silver flowers are woven copper smelted and among the most trifling matters are made the puppets with moving heads  the number of inhabitants in kaempsers time was        of which       were ecclesiastics  various streams unite and form a river which flows from hence to the great commercial city and port of osacca on a fine bay which last is said to be so populous that in case of need it could send forth an army of eighty thousand men  doctor kaempfer gives hist of japan vol ii p     tab    a very good idea of the beauty and singularity of some of the coasts between miaco and osacca in his views of simoasi morizu and muru with the semicircular hills with which those places are backed most characteristically cultivated to the very tops  jedo jedo the residence of the temporal and in fact the real emperor is built with far less regularity ibid vol ii tab     because built by degrees and on no certain plan it stands in lat       north the palace is very large and covers a vast extent of ground the city has great numbers of temples dedicated to amida and the various deities the ecclesiastics are of course prodigiously numerous the houses are in general small and mean and liable to frequent fires four thousand have been burnt by a single accident a large river runs through the city and falls into the harbor one branch encompasses the castle and divided into five streams unites with the other in the port  the naval force of the japanese is very small navy the emperors not having thought proper to maintain a fleet since the expulsion of foreigners presuming it impossible to have quarrels with nations with whom they could have no intercourse shipping the merchant ships which are built only for conveying goods from island to island are most clumsily made and by the emperors order in such a form as renders it impossible for them to go far to sea they are commonly about twentyeight yards long and eight broad the stern is square with a hole left in the middle expressly to increase the danger of distant navigation both stern and prow are very lofty the ships have only one mast and are constructed for rowing as well as failing the figures in kaempfer kaempfer hist of japan vol ii tab    will give the best notion of their form  korea and certain other territories korea have been long tributary to the japanese empire the neighboring korea shall be first mentioned i refer the reader to a future volume for farther particulars of that country here i shall briefly add its history as far as concerns the japanese it had been conquered first by mikaddo tsiuu ai emperor of japan and after that anno christi  0  by his relict dsin ju a princess celebrated for her abilities and valor the koreans in time shook off the japanese yoke and continued independent till taiko having usurped the secular empire in order to free himself from such of the nobility who were disaffected to his government and under pretense of reducing the koreans sent them at the head of a potent army they landed on the continent obliged the koreans but not without the bravest resistance to become once more tributary to the empire taiko died the affairs of korea were neglected and the japanese driven down to the coasts and of all their conquests left only in possession of the maritime parts of the province of tsiosijn and two islands one called iku the other tsussima on which is kept a garrison of fifty men but these islands are neither remarkable for their size or their fertility  the articles brought from thence are cod produce and other fish pickled walnuts rare medicinal plants and flowers and the famous gingseng roots and before the imperial prohibition certain earthen pots made in the tartarian provinces of japii and niuke  the other country dependent on japan isle of matmay is the island of matmay or matsumai part of the land of jeso divided from the north end of nipon by an incurvated straight in the nearest place sixty versts or fortyfive miles broad according to charlevoix in his fastes chronologiques the first european who visited that island was father jerome de angelis a sicilian jesuit who went there by sea from japan and landed at the capital he reached it in the year    0 and returned in      but without being certain whether it was an island or part of the continent nor has he left us any account either of it or its inhabitants  the next europeans who visited this country were the dutch land of jeso who in      sailed from the cape nabo in the ships castricom captain de vries and the breskes on a voyage of discovery off the coasts of tartary in lat     0 north they fell in with what they call eso or jeso whether this was the north extremity of matsumai or another land almost contiguous to it does not appear by mr arrowsmiths map it should seem that these discoverers sailed along the eastern coast of a certain country from the most southern part of matsumai as high as lat     0 and gave names to several bays or points of lands as to the western sides of the region they probably are quite undiscovered in the map i am so partial to not only that coast but those of the corresponding continent are left undetermined noted only with dotted lines even as high as the south end of the island of sachalin the intermediate space is the supposed straight of jeso whether the land of jeso is as mr muller conjectures any more than an archipelago or whether it is part of the tartarian continent at present remains extremely doubtful matsumai alone seems to have been proved to be an island the voyage of the unfortunate de la perouse has thrown considerable light on the hitherto undescribed land of jeso and the opposite shore of tartary after coasting for some time the inhospitable isles of japan that able navigator traversed the intervening sea till he came in sight of the continent of asia in lat    which he followed in a northerly direction and in lat       landed at the baie de ternai here he found a country of the most abundant vegetation but showing no signs of being occupied except by wandering hunters or occasional visitants by sea game of all kinds were seen in quantities and the sea afforded a copious supply of cod herring and falmon in an excursion inland some of the party discovered a tomb in which were deposited two bodies clad in the skin of bears chinese coin and copper ornaments were attached to their girdles and near them lay silver earings an iron hatchet a knife a wooden spoon a comb and a small bag of rice  still pursuing the coasts of chinese tartary the navigators touched at a bay to which they gave the name of suffrein situated in lat       continual fogs retarded their progress in lat       they discovered to the east the apparently rocky and barren shores of the nominal land of jeso part of the vast island tehoka or sachalin to which they sailed they found the inhabitants advanced to a considerable degree of civilization in consequence of their intercourse with the chinese parts of whose dress they had adopted and with whom and the mantchew tartars they carried on a trade in dried fish and oil leaving these intelligent islanders who had traced on the sand with almost geographical accuracy the object of his farther enquiry de la perouse proceeded northwards and touched at a spot he denominated baie destaing the channel between tehoka and the continent narrowed to the distance of twelve leagues the soundings also became gradually less and in lat       did not exceed nine fathoms the enterprizing spirit of a cook or a vancouver seemed here wanting de la perouse after a trial of a few hours remained satisfied that a bank of sand over which boats only could pass connected the shores and closed the extremity of the vast gulf he however draws the just conclusion that the island called sachalin by the russians the northern extremity of which has long been known extends from the   th to the   th degrees of latitude and consequently includes a portion of the yedzo or jeso of our geographers the straights which separate this island from that of matsumay are ascertained with accuracy and justly distinguished by the name of the french navigator  on the return of the ships from their fruitless attempt to penetrate into the sea of ochotsk they entered the baie de castries on the coast of tartary here was situated a small village inhabited by a race whose high cheek bones and small eyes announced its origin but it appeared only the occasional residence of different tribes for the purpose of fishing who carry the produce of their labor to the mantchew tartars living on the banks of the great river segalien or amur from whom they receive in exchange for their dried salmon grain nanquin and other articles probably brought from china the custom of leaving in their huts during the long season of absence for the purposes of commerce their bows arrows nets and such furniture as their few wants require constitutes an interesting proof of the honesty of this harmless race of people in several particulars they agree with the natives of kamchatka and tombs far exceeding the proportion of the apparent population excited similar astonishment and gives the same cause for investigation as the numerous memorials of the dead on the coast of america observed by vancouver  de la perouse after doubling cape crillon the southern extremity of the island sachalin in lat       landed in a secure bay inhabited by a tribe of a darker complexion than those of the north and more industrious their utensils and dress showed their intercourse with the japanese the distance from hence to the northern shores of the isle of matsamay does not exceed twelve leagues the navigators here fell into the track and had the opportunity of rendering justice to the veracity of the dutch voyagers in      e   that all the tract which the dutch saw to the west is that land of jeso there can be no dispute even matsumai is comprehended under that name that island was early annexed to the japanese empire and is chiefly peopled with exiles we have two accounts of the inhabitants of this country one is left us by captain saris the other by the dutch purchass pilgr vol i p      the former gives us the following information on the subject which he collected from a sensible japanese who had actually visited the island of matsumai we may collect from him that it was known to the japanese by the name of yedso or jeso the relation beginning thus  described that yedso is an island and lies on the northwest side of japan and distant from thence ten leagues that the people are white and of good condition but very hairy all their bodies over like munkeyes their weapones are bows and arrows poisoned the people in the southernmost part thereof do understand weight and measure whereof within the land thirty days journey they are ignorant they have much silver and sand gold whereof they make payment to the jappanners for rice etc rice and cotton cloth of japan is here well requested iron and lead is brought to them from japan necessaries for the belly and back are most vendible to them rice transported from japan to yedso has yielded four for one  the town where the japanners have their chief residence and mart is called matchma therein are five hundred household of japanners who likewise have a fort there the governor whereof is called matchmadonna this town of matchma is the principal mart town of all yedzo whither the natines most resort to buy and sell especially in september for their provision for winter in march they bring down salmon and dried fish of sundry sorts and other wares for which the japanners barter which the japanners rather desire than silver  the japanners have no settled being or trade in any other town then matchma that further to the northward upon the same land are people of very low stature like dwarfes that the yedzos are people of the stature of the japanners and have no apparel but what is brought them from japan that there settleth a very violent current between yedzo and japan which comes from corea and sets to the eastnortheast that the winds are for the most part as usually they are in japan viz that the northerly winds begin in september and end in march and then the southerly winds begin to blow  the account given by the commander of the castricom concurs in a great measure with the above the author of the recueil de voyages au nord vol iv has preserved the voyage it appears that the captain had landed in several places that in lat     0 he found the country very mountanous and high covered with lofty trees many of which were fit for masts the soil very clayey and wet and near the shores covered with brushwood it was reported that there were several rich silver mines  in lat     0 acquies at a place called acquies the land was very high and covered with trees the soil clayey but producing good fruits such as mulberries red and white gooseberries raspberries etc also oaks and other kinds of trees and in the valleys lilies of a vast height the rivers are bordered by rushes and also with red roses  in lat     0 he fell into a great gulf abounding with salmon the shore was covered with vegetables and had the appearance of the coasts of england but the natives neither cultivated the ground nor made any advantage of their rich soil the most northern part of the range which he touched at on this coast was in lat     0 where he found the land rise into little hills clothed with herbage and met with good anchorage in from    to  0 fathoms depth with a bottom of sand  he speaks in general of the inhabitants of the coast of jeso as being strong and square made natives of jeso short and gross their hair and beard long and the last so thick as almost to cover their whole face their bodies likewise very hairy the hair on the fore part of the head is shaved the features are tolerably good their eyes black forehead flat complexion yellow both sexes wear rings in their ears and on their fingers their dress is of the japanese fashion some is made of silk others of stuff and others of the skins of animals  their houses are built against the slope of a hill houses constructed of planks and covered with the bark of trees they are supported by the trunks and have an hole at top to let out the smoke their fireplace is in the middle of the floor their doors so low that they are obliged to creep in the only furniture is matting made by the women to these add a cup and a plate of varnished ware for each individual in the family in some respects the houses resemble those of nootka sound and are in groups of fifteen or twenty each group about half a league distant from the other and each seems to be peopled with a kindred clan  the common food of the natives is the lard and oil of whales food fish and all sorts of vegetables especially the fruit of roses which are as large as medlars and being dried are considered as excellent winter provision notwithstanding this they often die of cold or famine it is customary with them to put their dead into a case and cover them with oystershells these are supported by four posts placed beneath huts neatly made  the natives of matsumai show very few signs of religion religion nor have they any idols when they drink if they are near the fire they pour a few drops into it they also stick in their chambers some small rods with little flags at the end if a person falls sick they cut long slips of the wood and tie them round the head and arms of the patient  notwithstanding the rude appearance of these people manners they are prudent and civilized in their manners and among strangers pay them the compliment of putting on their best clothes  they are a very indolent race never cultivate the ground but pass much of their time on the water in canoes which they call praos cut out of the trunk of some great tree raised on the side with planks in these they go to the chase of seals which they shoot with arrows or of whales which they harpoon they beside catch other fishes with seines in the manner done in europe several objects of chase are mentioned birds they catch in snares and shoot with arrows elks roes stags bears and other animals unknown to the dutch navigators besides the weapons i have mentioned they wear a short cutlass made of iron which they procure from the japanese  hemp grows wild in the country hemp the women spin it i suppose by splitting it first they then hold one end between their teeth and turn and twist it into thread on a distaff  the natives exchange with the japanese the lard and oil of whales and fishes the dried tongues of whales furs and feathers of eagles for winging of arrows the people of japan pay them an annual visit and bring in return rice sugar silken clothes in the japanese fashion smoakingpipes tobacco and varnished cups and plates the japanese seem to have introduced civilization among these people by their intercourse with them the chinese sometimes come and trade with them the capital of this chain of islands is called matsumai and is the residence of the prince or governor who annually makes a voyage to jedo to do homage to the emperor the japanese once attempted to extend their conquests from matsumai northward they succeeded at first but after a revolt of the inhabitants kaempfer i p     are now content to accept from the chieftain whom they style prince of jeso a tribute of very small value which is annually paid at matsumai  we now arrive at the southernmost isles of the long chain of the kurils kuril isles i have given an account of the most northern in my introduction to the arctic zoology the whole chain diverges to the northeast in a direct line and concludes very near to the cape of lopatka in kamschatka the russians reckon matsumai among the number those next to the land of jeso were discovered by the casticrom tschicota kounaschir and atorkou are the most southern the two first lie opposite to matsumai and at no great distance from its coasts and atorkou a little to the northeast tschicota is a hundred and twenty versts or ninety miles long and forty miles broad kounaschir is about a hundred and twelve miles long and about thirtyseven broad and atorkou or etorpu is equal in length and breadth being two hundred and twentyfive miles across according to the russian accounts in the neue nordische beytrage vol iv      this island is the statenland of the dutch statenland a name bestowed on it in their voyage of       ouropi is the companys land of the same voyagers companys land and they bestowed on the straight which separates it from atorkou the name of de vriess de vriess straight in honor of their commander no places have puzzled geographers so greatly danville gives to jeso josogasima as it is sometimes called the form of a vast island and to the companys land and statenland a figure possibly very different from the reality the editors of cooks voyage make them only small islands the russians again in their history of kamschatka give them another form and mr arrowsmith very properly leaves it undecided whether jeso is continent or archipelago this being mentioned we hasten to the conclusion of this volume and give a brief account of the remainder of the kuril isles etorpu the nineteenth in order reckoning from lopatkanoss comes next most of the islands of this long chain are volcanic raschotti the tenth has in our days been so rent with an earthquake as entirely to drive away the numerous flocks of birds that used to frequent its cliffs but the sealions still keep their stations volcanoes on kounaschir the twentieth is one volcano on etorpu are two on amakutan another and on the lofty poromoschir the highest in the chain remarkable for its vast peaked mountains is probably another i have treated of these islands so fully in my introduction to the arctic zoology that i shall not tire my reader with the repetition i therefore will only say here that many of them have been conquered by the russians who not thinking them worth the expense of colonizing content themselves with accepting a small tribute  the inhabitants resemble those of the land of jeso natives and are equally hairy by the accounts of the russians who visited these islands in      they differ in some of their customs from the former they have multitudes of little household gods like the mongol tartars and they pay a worship to the owl the mongols do the same for the reason given in the zoological part of the arctic zoology vol i p      this may direct us to the origin of these islanders they bury their dead in the earth and believe in a future life to be passed in certain
