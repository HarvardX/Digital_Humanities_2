a dialogue between a dissenter and the observator concerning the shortest way with the dissenters  london printed in the year mdcciii  a dialogue etc dissen pray sir are you the author of the observator   obser suppose it sir what then   dis nay dont be angry are you the reputed author a come off you taught me in one of your papers about mr f   obs and what then   dis why i wanted a little civil discourse with you   obs if it be civil as you say you are welcome but you begin but odly   dis my questions may be blunt but you are not bound to answer them but let that be as you like em  first pray who do you reckon is the author of this devilish book called the shortest way   obs i shall answer most of your questions with a question i believe and begin with you here  do you think my name is mr bellamy that you take me for an informer read the gazett there you have the man with the sharp chin and a dutch nose   dis ay but sir we begin to doubt that is not the true author that he has been only made the tool of some other party who now they find the world exasperated at it have slipped out of the noose and left him in it we begin to be afraid the thing is a reality and there is such a design on foot   obs your answer like parson jacobs text ought to be taken a pieces and explained    if you are not sure he is the author you dissenters have done him a great deal of wrong for you have railed at him more than all the rest of the world and charged him with more crimes than it is well possible for one man to be guilty of    and yet by supposing him not to be the author you suppose him to be very honest to his friends that he bears all this without discovering them    as for your fears of a real design to put the shortest way in practice upon you no question there are abundance of people in the world who would be glad there was not one of you left i believe no body doubts it   dis pray who do you think they are   obs sir your humble servant no bellamy i tell you not i sir if i were in a plot with the devil i will never turn evidence besides sir i have no mind to have my nose and chin described but if you please i will answer you negatively who i believe are not concerned in it   dis that may be some satisfaction sir   obs not the queen sir not the parliament not the council not the army not the ministers of state not the government   dis thou art a safe man thou wilt never go to newgate for negatives   obs no sir nor for positives neither if i can help it but you have had your will at catechizing and i ought to have my turn let me ask you a few questions too   dis you are welcome   obs pray why are you dissenters angry at the book called the shortest way it is a little mysterious sir that the church men are affronted because it was writ against them and the dissenters are affronted because it is wrote against them too i dont well understand it ne sort must be fools that is certain   dis i dont care whether i understand it or no he is a rogue a villain and i wish the government had him if i knew where he was i would deliver him up and abate them the  0 l   obs spoken like a dissenter truly so that i find you are angry at him because you dont understand him and the government because they do   dis you are so sharp upon me i do understand a a little too i understand he meddld with that he had nothing to do with and he is the man they say who has been the occasion of all this persecution which is coming upon us by railing at occasional conformity   obs if he exposed you for occasional conformity it is what you ought to have rectified your selves that you need not have been exposed for it and in that he was your friend for had you took the hint and exploded the practice there had been no need of an act of parliament to force you to it   dis but what had he to do with that   obs nay what had mr how to do to meddle with it afterward i will assure you his name is down in my pocket book and when any man in england defends a cause worse i will put his name out and put to others name in but pray sir why do you call this bringilng persecution upon you do you suppose the occasional bill will be a persecution   dis without doubt it will   obs what sort of persecution can you call it it cannot be a persecution for conscience sake   dis why so sir   obs why pray sir suppose one of your brethren dissenters who can go to the meeting to day and to the church to morrow take the sacrament to day sitting and to morrow to get a good place go to church and take it kneeling wipe his mouth and go home to dinner and so to the meeting again suppose this genleman should be put up for sherriff or lord mayor can this man pretend conscience not to conform i tell you sir mr how must make a better answer to the matter before i can be convinced you may call it persecution but it can never be for conscience sake   dis persecution is persecution let it be for what sake it will every man ought to be at liberty   obs ay that is true  am for liberty for every man to serve god as is most agreeable to his conscience but this is not serving god at all besides sir i could easily make it appear this act is for your advantage if ye were a sort of people were to be convinced   dis pray how sir   obs why sir it will purge you of all your half in half professors that is one thing then it will put all those gentlemen into a capacity of being in places and parliaments who though by this act they are separated from you and rejoined to the church because they can conform will still be friends to your interest in all public concerns and therefore had i been to word the bill so as to have done most harm it should have excluded all that ever were dissenters and have forced you to continue so and not have accepted your return to the church without a public repentance   dis well well you may persuade us it is for our advantage but we dont like it and therefore we hate him for meddling with it for what had he to do with it   obs about as much as you and i have to do with him if a man meddles with what does not concern him that is his fault and if we who really have nothing to do with him meddle with him that is our fault let the government alone with him have you nothing else to talk on   dis why all the town has talked of him as wellas we   obs yes and reckoned up all his faults all the sins that ever he committed in his life and abundance more be the man who he will and what he will i dont see but the best of us would be loath all the faults we have should be reckoned up and writ in our foreheads as his are   dis oh he has been a most wicked wretch   obs you force a man to be an advocate for one he has no kindness for a wicked wretch you say why what has he been a thief a murderer   dis no no i dont mean that way   obs what has he been a clipper or coyner   dis no no nor that neither   obs has he been a whoremaster or a drunkard or a swearer   dis no i cannot say so neither but he broke and cannot pay his debts   obs if you had said he had broke and will not pay his debts you had said more to the purpose  but i must do one piece of justice to the man though i love him no better than you do that is this that meeting a gentleman in a coffeehouse where i and every body else was railing at him the gentlemen took us up with this short speech  gentlemen said he i know this d foe as well as any of you and i was one of his creditors and i compounded with him and discharged him fully and several years afterward he sent for me and though he was clearly discharged he paid me all the remainder of his debt voluntarily and of his own accord and he told me that as fast as god should enable him he intended to do so with every body when he had done he desired me to set my hand to a paper to acknowledge it which i readily did and found a great many names to the paper before me and i think my self bound to own it though i am no friend to the book he has wrote no more than you what do you think of this story   dis think of it i dont believe it   obs i cannot help that nor i care not whether you do or no but i assure you after i heard it i never railed at him any more   dis ay but i will rail at him for all that   obs you dissenters are in something like case with the pharisees when the question was put to them by our savior about johns baptism whether it was from heaven or of men if a man should ask you of the shortest way was it wrote for you or against you if you should say for us you would be asked why then are you so mad with the author and if you should say against you the people would laugh at you for all men but you see into it and that a dissenter wrote it you must say therefore we cannot tell and consequently that you rail at the author for you cannot tell what   dis but we dont count him a dissenter   obs he has all the marks of a dissenter upon him but mant of brains   dis why are we so empty of brains pray   obs there is reason for it god has given you equivalents   dis i dont understand you   obs that is a further testimony of your being a dissenter why if you will have it take it i say god almighty would have seemed unkind to you if he had not given you a great deal of grace for he has given you but little wit   dis well i hope they will take him still i should be glad to see him hanged for it i am sure he deserves it i heard one met him a little while ago would i had been there   obs alone do you mean sir or to have helped the other   diss any how so i could but have taken him   obs twas in hackney fields was it not   dis yes i think so   obs ay and they say twas one of your own party too and one that would fain have got the  0 l but that he drew upon him frighted him out of his wits and made him down of his knees and swear that if ever he met him again he should shut his eyes till he was half a mile off him   diss i dont think he is such a fighting fellow   obs do you know him   diss no not i   obs so i thought by your charity and good nature i know him not neither but the man has the government upon his back already and if they take him they will avenge your quarrel for you let him alone it is ingenerous as i said before in print to triumph over a man in his affliction twas but a little while ago he wrote a book that pleased you and then you cried him up as much as now you cry him down   dis what book pray   obs why the new test of church of england loyalty   diss did he write that book   obs i told you i was no informer go ask mr bellamy   dis why truly that was a good thing i liked it fully twas well done but this cursed shortestway is the devil he must be turned rogue now what ever he was then   obs why this it is to oblige a dissenter if you serve them a hundred times it is well but once get your head in the pillory for them and they will be the first to palt you with rotten eggs what cannot you set down one good thing and one bad and balance with him you understand accounts well enough but you dissenters are like a shop keeper i knew who having traded  0 year with a gentleman and served all his family and gotten a great deal of money by him at last the poor gentleman fell to decay and owing him  0 s the shopkeeper abused him and called him all the knaves and rogues for cheating of him of  0 s   dis no no this has spoylt all   obs well but we will go back further with you there is the reformation of manners and the true bornenglishman there he pleased you for certain for he is for reforming your magistrates   dis i dont understand them i am for reformation as much as any body   obs but what say you to the legion paper   dis ay that was a good thing indeed   obs well but if he had been taken in doing that would you not have called him as many rogues then as you do now   dis no indeed should i not   obs but i dont find you call him one rogue the less for it now and that is hard   diss well but you see he denies it and challenges you to prove it   obs ay deny it i told you he was no fool indeed i am not glad i printed it for though it is charged upon him by common fame i am not for hanging men upon suppositions as you do   diss well you do well and i think it is a little hard the man is gone and though he has done ill he might mean no harm and so let him alone i reckon you will not be long before you follow him   obs and when i am gone you will call me as many rogues as you do him will not you   dis no it may be i shall not but i can tell you of some that do already   obs it is all one to me common fame like a common strumpet jilts every body but methinks slander and reproach out of the mouth of a dissenter comes with some more than common ill favor   diss they think they have good reason for it upon you   obs and i think not pray what are their good reasons   diss for abusing your friends   obs my friends prithee who are they i know but very few i have and i am very sure i never abused them   dis they all agree you would not be permitted to write so long but the party would have ruffled you before now only you court them and please them by a sidewind with your railing at king williams friends sometimes   obs king williams enemies you mean look sir i have as much veneration for the memory of king william as any of you and do but once prove them to be king williams friends and i will own all you say and recant all i have wrote   dis it is easy to prove they were his friends   obs pray sir dont you tax me with abusing king william and abuse him your self i have proved sufficiently they were the nations enemies now if you can prove the nations enemies were king vvilliams friends you will make a fine spot of work on it indeed   diss the nations enemies that is because being in great places they got as much money as they could and so would you do and so have all the favorites that ever were or will be   obs when ever favorites did do or shall get money by rapine or injustice and oppression of the subject they were and will be the nations enemies and their sovereigns too   diss but what have you to do with it it is none of your business   obs it is every mans business to discover mischief fraud and ill design as much as every man who first spies fire has a duty upon him to raise the neighbors i am a subject and am cheated among the rest   dis you cheated why what have you to lose   obs why my liberty which you said but now every man had a right to and my money when i have it what is that to you how little or much i have and how do you know how much i may have hereafter   dis nay they say you get money by railing and so you may soon be rich   obs then i rail for something and you get none and yet you rail pray who has the best excuse for it   dis he that has the best reason for it not he that gets the most money by it   obs i believe if you could get money by railing you would count it the best reason in the world   dis why so   obs because you are so willing to rail at any body when you know not for what nor why and charge people with crimes they never committed of all your christian duties you make the least use of your charity   dis why since you put so hard i can tell the time when you abused king william himself as openly as you durst speak it or any body dare print particularly in a poem of yours called the foreigners   obs how do you prove twas mine   dis nay they say twas yours you were the reputed author as you said in another case   obs i tell you there is no people in the world so forward to condemn a man upon hear say as the dissenters when they have a mind to slander a man they take every thing upon trust it is their shortest way   dis these scribbling people are always meddling with things they have nothing to do with what have you to do with kings and favorites or that the other fellow with the shortest way you pamphleteers are always quacking with the state   obs come let us turn the tables now it is my play what have you to do with acts of parliamenrs you dissenters are always thrusting in your oar too what have you to do to talk of persecution and acts against occasional conformity you are mountebanking with the state too in every coffeehouse pray meddle with your own business   dis we shall have to do with it when we feel it   obs i am persuaded if you were put to it severely few of you would stay to feel it at least few of your wealthy members few of mr hows mind few of such dissenters as go from meetting to church and can backstroke and forestroke communicate on both sides   dis i wish they may not but we are afraid twill not only be a persecution but a very long one   obs why then you are beholding to the author we talked of for you see he is for putting you out of your pain but i am of a different opinion from you in several of your darkest thoughts about persecution   dis pray what is your opinion   obs   i am of opinion that if your enemies were true masters of politics they would not persecute you at all i take you to be a declining party toleration will be your ruin and if god in mercy to you dont send a persecution among you you are lost you will all dwindle back into the church again your old stock of ministers dye off your owens mantons charnocks clarksons baxters and batess are gone and pray what can you name out of the new generation of your leyden doctors fit to succeed them    the occasional bill at once carries off your wealthy members who are the support of your clergy and as mr williams very well observed at saltershall if the rich ones forsake you the party will be weakened so as to make you fear the dissolution of the whole indeed the gentleman was in the right if the wealthy members quit the congregations twill make poor work for the ministers and they like other people generally do their work best where they have best wages   dis i thought you had loved the dissenters better than to abuse them at this rate   obs i dont abuse them i wish them clear of all their hypocrites and that there were none among them but what were dissenters for mere conscience if that were so twould make their enemies at peace with them they would never be persecuted the government would cherish them and be as tender of them as they would desire but to be plain with you it is your own pride and pushing at great things has made you obnoxious and withal your discovering by an alternate doublefacd conscience that while you pretend to dissent and to have tender consciences you can nevertheless conform if you plaese this makes your enemies suspect your honesty and apprehend more trick and design in you than i hope they need nay this gives your enemies such advantage against you as you can never answer   dis i do not think any man ought to be confined by laws and acts of parliaments about his religion   obs it may be i think so too but men ought to be honest to their own principles whether there were laws or no and if i see a man pretend he cannot conform and upon occasion i find he can it makes me suspect his honesty and if i once think a man a knave i am not to blame to fence my self against him by laws i tell you an act of parliament to keep you honest can never be called persecution   dis ay if there was no more in it   obs if there be any more in it i wish there was not i am sure i know not what is in it and i believe you dont neither pray have you seen the bill   dis no not i but i hear it is a very terrible bill   obs true to the old way still always to judge before you hear indeed i forgot to ask you but on my conscience i dont believe you ever read the book of the shortest way come be honest   diss read it why the very outside of that is enough for any man to read i thank god i spend my time better   obs i think you ought to spend your time better too than to give your verdict upon any thing before you read it   diss you are a strange man why every body says it is a horrible book and not fit to be read but what is that to this act of parliament   obs why thus much it is that you cry out persecution from this act of parliament and there is not a word of persecution in it   diss i think it is persecution if i must not be at liberty to worship god as i think fit   obs still you are without book why you may be a dissenter all the days of your life and go to meetings as long as you live and never be troubled by this act   diss i cannot imagine what you mean why i must pay god knows what if i am seen at a meeting   obs ay sir that is after you have strained your conscience from the meeting to the church after you have bobd your religion to be sheriff of london or the like and then want to go back again but if you to keep your conscience can be content to be without these gay things called places you may be a dissenter to the end of the chapter so that this will only be a persecution for honor sake not for conscience sake and never fall upon you neither till you bring it upon your self   diss well i hope it will not pass for all that   obs i hope so too but if it dont it must be the lords doing and it will be mavelous in our eyes   diss the house of lords you mean i suppose   obs i must mean as you will have me let it be how it will but if i hope it will not pass it is from different reasons with you   diss pray your reasons   obs because i am against and ever shall be imposing any religious ordinance or part of worship as a qualification for any temporal employment let the princes be at full liberty to employ who or what sort of their subjects they see cause   such impositions are a bait to people to banter their consciences and to comply with that for a preferment which otherwise they would not and so seem to lead them into temptation but i dont know the contents of the bill therefore i will say no more   diss and i would not have it pass because i take it to be a foundation of persecution it is but pulling down the toleration next and then we are all undone   obs you faithless and perverse generation has not the queen promised to maintain your toleration besides what is that to the bill   diss why should not we be afraid of it as well as some of the churchparty have the confidence to hope it nay to condemn the toleration as antichristian and threaten us with the having it overthrown   obs why these are for the shortest way you ought to rail at them as much as you do at the man with the book nose and sharp chin and more too and no doubt if you would but turn informer you might hook their noses into the gazett too to be sure the government would not allow of it they would never suffer the queen to be so affronted   diss i dont know how it is such things are suffered daily i heard our parson the other day say at a public dinner twoud never be well with england till some course was taken to reconcile all dissenters to the church longest way or shortest twas all one to him he said he hoped to see the church flourish without them and a great deal more and worse than this   obs that was a topping highflying gentleman indeed and why did you not acquaint the government with it   diss what do you think i am an informer my name is not bellamy any more than yours but pray why do you make so strange of it dont we hear daily people expressing their highflying hopes that a parliament in scotland will restore episcopacy there and yet has not the queen given her word and published it in our gazett that she will maintain the presbyterian government there   obs has she so then though they have the impudence to hope you ought not to have the ignorance to fear it the queen gave her word to maintain it be not slow of heart to believe she has taken up the famous motto of q flizabeth semper eadem and can you so much as doubt she will deface it for a few scotch bishops   diss i am sorry for my fears i beg her majestys pardon there are so many turns and windings in law and state matters that we know not what to say to things   obs say why a promise is a promise and you may depend upon it she has never broke her word with us yet   diss ay but what if the parliament should do it   obs nay if the parliament does it we do it our selves   diss very good so that we may be undone and the toleration bill taken away and yet the queen be as good as her word still   obs yes sir so you may whenever an act of parliament becomes so without the royal assent and when do you think that can be   diss why then these highflying churchmen are very impudent fellows to suggest such things of the queen and to bully us with overturning the toleration and put us in such fears of what they will do to us when it can never be done without the queens acting so directly against her royal promise   obs well and what then   dis why i think they ought to be used as they used the author of the shortest way gazetted and a reward for the discoverer   obs or as you have used him rather viz rail at them for being of your own side you dissenters are rare fellows for punishments if god should have no more mercy on you than you show to all men that offend you we should have plagues pestilence and famine every year upon us so now you are come about again these high flying church men have bullyd you with the fears of losing your toleration come confess   dis yes   obs and made you distrust the queens veracity   dis yeas god and the queen forgive us   obs and have terrified you with what things they will do when they have pulled down your antichristian toleration have they not   dis ay ay   obs and so you thought the shortest way was wrote to make a beginning with you and to set the dragoons of the church upon your backs did you not   dis it is very true   obs and continued of the same mind like an ignoramus though you heard twas wrote by one of your own party   dis indeed i did   obs now pray after so much patience as i have had with you have a little with me and if i can i will set you right in your thoughts of these things  there are a sort of people among the dissenters who can either dissent or conform as they find their inclinations or interest rather directs them these by their wealth and interest have always put themselves into good places and qualified themselves for that purpose by taking the sacrament of these people even the most moderate church men have an ill opinion and truly so have two thirds of your own friends for it looks as if they were men of no principles at all  against these men the act against occasional conformity is principally designed and if there was nothing else in the bill i believe no good man would be against it  concerning these things two sorts of people have been very grossly mistaken and upon their mistakes have proceeded to act very foolishly  first the high flying church party begun to think all was a going their own way and that the government would fall in with them and do your business for you and away they run with the notion and preach you down and print you down and talk you down like mad men there is sermon upon sermon pamphlet upon pamphlet one says you are all rogues and hypocrites another says you are enemies to the government one flies at the toleration and tells the world it is destructive to the nations happiness and the politicians must pull it down another says it is antichristian and we cannot be true sons of the church of england if we dont pull it down others like harebraind huntsmen that overrun the hounds roar you down with full cry till they run themselves out of breath others are for having you deprived of voices in elections of parliament in hopes of arriving to that blessed day when they shall have a parliament of their own mind and thus they run before they are sent and without reflecting upon their ill grounded zeal without examining any authorities other than their passions without regard to good manners taking no notice of the preamble of the act of parliament which declares against persecution or the honor and sacred promise of her majesty given to make her subjects easy they blow up the fire of persecution and destruction whether the government will or no  you are the next sort of people who are mistaken for being naturally a little hypish as the beaus call it troubled with the spleen and hypocondriack vapors this cloud of raillery so darkened your understanding that you presently take these people and the queen these people and the government these people and the parliament to be all of a mind and the queen having displact all your friends as it is but just that all princes should employ who they please and the parliament falling on your occasional conformers and this book of the shortest way coming out altogether the high church party thundered at you from the press and the pulpit away you run with the notion that you are all to be blown up that all these things aimed at your destruction and that fire and faggot was at the door  but the government is steady and the queen still has maintained her motto the parliament steers in the middle way going about to restrain but not to destroy you and taking no notice either of the heat of one party or folly of the other they hold the balance of your liberty between your own exorbitant license and the other partys unchristian fury and in my opinion thus far are you safe   diss but then why has not the government thought fit to disown the zeal of these highflyers by punishment and make examples of some of them   obs i told you the dissenters were all for punishments and examples for the same reason that they have not punished you for suspecting the queens honesty to her word charging the parliament with going about to persecute you and the like for this reason because they are more merciful than both parties deserve   dis twould have convinced us very plainly of two very significant things first that there is such a design and then that the authors of it received no countenance from court   obs good manners and common justice ought to have convinced you of the last and your author of the shortest way to his cost opened your eyes in the first if you had not wilfully shut them against the light    good manners would inform you not to doubt the word of your prince till you had some reason from her majesty her self    common justice commands us to suppose every person just and honest till something appears to the contrary and it is a very unchristian uncharitable way of treating the queen that because some of the high churchmen have had the indiscretion without her authority to swagger you out of your senses therefore you must suppose her promise broken and her word of no value  the author of the shortest way comes with a lanthorn for you and he sums up all the black things this high party had published into one general and if you had any eyes you might learn two things from him where he is like topay dear enough for teaching you  first from the general abhorrence mankind showed of the book you might learn that the destruction of your party is a cruelty not to be found in the english nature  secondly from the outcry made against it by that party in particular you might learn who they were that were touched in the book and where the design against them lay  as to the quarrel you dissenters have at the book that is a mystery no man can unriddle but your selves it is like mr meads wheel within a wheel and a further testimony to the world that you are a most unaccountable people whose ways are past finding out   diss so that you would go about to persuade me the book was writ of our side   obs first sir it is hard to know what side you are off and  secondly sir i know you too well to go about to persuade you to any thing whose peculiar talent is to be unperswadeable but if you will please to answer me a few questions you may perhaps persuade your self of something or other   diss what questions   obs why are the high churchmen angry with him while at the same time they openly declare it is the only way to deal with you and what they would feign be at   dis truly you puzzle me a little there   obs they are angry because they take the book as the author meant it and you because you take it as he wrote it they as he meant viz to expose them and though they are heartily willing to do you a kindness that way and have shown their good will by their words yet knowing they wanted power to execute it and being conscious to themselves that the government was not of their opinion they are enraged to have all their designs laid open in minature and an abridgment communicated to the world in true billinsgate   dis there may be some truth in this but pray why then is the government so angry with him i believe i have puzzled you now   obs no no the government may have reasons to be angry that you nor i know not off nor have nothing to do with but what if i should suppose  that the government not thinking any person could be so barbarous as to harbor such a villainous design as the book suggests are displeased at it as an affront done to the church of england to father principles of cruelty and destruction upon her members which they are not guilty off  i say if i suppose this to be a reason i believe you cannot suppose a better   dis i confess i begin to have better thoughts of the government than i had   obs i am glad of that   dis i begin to hope they will not persecute us now and as for occasional conformity what care i i shall never be lord mayor or common council man if i am called to it it is time enough to come off then   obs god almighty is wonderfully beholden to you when he calls you from a middle state to a good place you will take it for granted he calls you from the meeting to the church and you will be sure to come but i tell you you ought to be so far from the fear of a persecution that if you have any respect to your party you ought to pray for a persecution upon them or ye are all undone   dis why thou art mad thou art for the shortest way   obs no no i ant for such persecution neither but i told you my mind before i am sure you have received more damage in your interest as disse nters and more weakened your reputation as well as your number since the late tolleration than ever your enemies did for you by all the penal laws informers fines and prisons of the last persecution   dis well but here is another danger upon us that we have not talked of yet and fear it will come upon us too   obs pray what is that   dis we are afraid that this restless party will overthrow our settlement for they do not stick to talk that way   obs we afraid who do you mean by we are not the church of england as much concerned in the settlement as you and more too as they are the major part of the nation and we if you will give me leave to talk your way we protestants fear nothing for our settlement and for this i will give you a quotation from the man with the hook nose and sharp chin it may be you will not like it because of the author but his words are these the settlement of the crown says he is the basis of our religion laws and liberties this is the solid bottom on which we all stand and of which with respect to civil right may be said other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid it is the rock on which we are all built and that stone of which according to the scripture it may without profaneness be said whosoever it falls upon he will be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder it is the last thing the people of england will part with after all their estates wives and children churches and houses are destroyed  it is the pledge of the divine goodness to the nation which they purchased at the expense of  0 millions of money and the blood of above  00000 english men in eleven years war  it was one of the great things king william did for us and the treasure god and his majesty left in our hands in trust for our posterity which if we part with our children will curse our memory and digg us out of our graves  it is a thing so sacred the dissolving of it cannot be mentioned without a crime nor so much as intended without being guilty of treason in the most intense degree  it is the solid prop upon which stands her present majestys throne and the right and just title she has to govern us  it is like the two pillars in the house of dagon whoever pulls them down will like sampson be buried in the ruins and pull the whole nation upon their heads   i fear nothing for this settlement the parliament of england are the trustees for the seeing it forth coming to the people of england and a parliament of england will never betray their trust  the parliament will not and all the rest of humane power dare not attempt to dissolve it no weapon formed against it can prosper     dis is this done by our shortest way man   obs the very same   dis well i shall love him the better for it but there is one thing more still what say you to the prince of wales if ever he comes again you will be hanged that is for certain   obs and if ever we let him come we ought all to be hanged i can do no better than refer you to the same author  the act of settlement says he and the prince of wales are the two bucketts keep one but up and the other must be down and put the one down and the other comes up of course there can be no pretense made to alter or dispose the settlement but the bringing in the prince of wales therefore whoever they are that mention it we ought to suppose they would be so understood   dis so that you are of opinion we are in no danger of our settlement   obs indeed i am of the opinion your fears both of the prince of wales and of altering the settlement and of persecution are all groundless and equally so i would only advise the dissenters to be honest to their own principles if they can conform they ought to do it if they cannot no body forces them let them dissent and not for the desire of preferment bring such a scandal upon their integrity as if they were men of no principles it is scandalous to the very name of a dissenter and injurious to all the rest of that body who are honest and conscientious   and so i bid you farewell
