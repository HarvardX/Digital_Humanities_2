a supplement to huttons arithmetic containing the solutions at full length of the promiscuous collection of questions proposed in that work  by the author  london printed for g robinson and r baldwin in paternoster row  m dcc lxxviii  advertisement the promiscuous collection of questions proposed in the arithmetic was intended for the exercise of pupils after they had gone through the several rules of the book and has been found very useful to them by accustoming them to think and to strike out methods of solution unassisted by other helps but many gentlemen having expressed a desire to have a publication of the solutions of those questions at full length that they might have the satisfaction to compare their own solutions with those of the author and thereby the opportunity of choosing which they like best he has herein complied with their request  these solutions are published apart from the work itself that the teacher may avail himself of them and yet keep them from the sight of his pupils if he so chooses each learner having only the book of arithmetic for the purposes therein mentioned  the solutions are all delivered in what have been judged to be the best forms sometimes two methods are given where they seemed necessary in such of them as contain any proportions or ruleofthree statings the fourth term is generally put down in the form of a vulgar fraction placing the product of the second and third terms as numerator to be divided by the first as a denominator the fraction is then abbreviated as much as it can be before the multiplication and division are performed by which means generally these two operations are entirely saved or at least much shortened and facilitated by bringing them to such small numbers as can be easily multiplied and divided mentally and the answer thence discovered without any other intermediate figures or operations to be written down so that there is never occasion for more writing than appears in the operations as here printed where it will be found that to avoid the long form of division the large divisors are separated into their component parts and the divisions performed separately by them which are always done by writing down only the quotients but where the numbers are so large as to make long divisions or multiplications unavoidable those operations are always placed down at the bottom of the solution that so none of the necessary part of the writing in the full solution might be omitted  a promiscuous collection of questions and their solutions question i a was born when b was    years of age how old will a be when b is    and what will be the age of b when a is  0  ans a    b     solution from    take    ans     as age to  0 add      bs age question   what difference is there between twice five and twenty and twice twentyfive  ans  0  solution from  0  x   twice    take  0  x     0 0   0twice   and  0 or 0 and twice   remains  0the answer question   what number taken from the square of    will leave    times     ans     0  solution   otherwise   the answer  question   what number added to the thirtyfirst part of      will make the sum  00  ans     solution   otherwise    question   what number deducted from the   d part of     0 will leave the   th part of the same  ans   0  solution   otherwise    question   the remainder of a division is     the quotient     the divisor is    more than the sum of both what is the dividend  ans   0  0  solution the answer or dividend here is to be found by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and to the product adding the remainder that is  the dividend required   sum is   0  0 the dividend or answer  question   a person at the time of his outsetting in trade owed   0l and had in cash   0 l  0s in wares    l  d and in good debts   0l  s  0d now after having traded a year he owed  0 l   s and had in cash     l  s  d in bills   0l in wares  0  l   s  d and in recoverable debts    l   s  0d what was his real gain that year  ans    l  s  d  solution   question   two persons depart from the same place at the same time the one travels  0 the other    miles a day how far are they distant after   days if they travel both the same road and how far if they travel in contrary directions  ans    and     miles  solution here  the answer in the  st case  and  miles in the other  question   a gentlemans daily expense is  l  s        d and he saves  00l in the year what is his yearly income   ans   0 l   s  solution here the daily expense must be multiplied by     the days in year and the  00l added to the product but     is   x   therefore multiply by    and by   as below    question  0 having a piece of land    poles in breadth i demand what length of it must be taken to contain an acre when   poles in breadth require  0 poles in length to contain the same  ans    pls   yds  solution as   question    if a gentleman whose annual income is  000l spend  0 guineas a week whether will he save or run in debt and how much in the year  ans   l debt  solution   question    in the latitude of london the distance round the earth measuring in the parallel of latitude is about     0 miles now as the earth turns

of  0000l a b and c together subscribe    0l and d the rest now a and b are known together to have set their hands to   00l and a has been heard to say that he had undertaken for   0l more than b what did each proprietor advance  ans a      b      c    0 d  0 0  solution   question    a tradesman increased his estate annually by  00l more than part of it and at the end of   years found that his estate amounted to  0   l  s  d what had he at outsetting  ans  000l  solution here the amount at the end of each year is equal to  00l more than of what he had at the beginning of the same year therefore subtract  00l and there remains    of what he had at the beginning of that year consequently subtracting of this remainder from itself there will at last remain the sum at the beginning of the year and this operation must be made   times for the   years as here follows    question    paid  0  l  0s for   0l taken in   years ago at what rate per cent per ann did i pay interest   ans  l  solution   then as   0 00          per cent the answer  or as               per cent the answer  question    what is the interest of   0l for    days or of a year at  l per cent per annum ans  l  s  d

 the answer  question    a stationer sold quills at  0s  d a thousand by which he cleared of the money but growing scarce raised them to   s a thousand what did he clear per cent by the latter price  ans   l  s     d  solution   therefore as  the answer  question    if  000 men besieged in a town with provisions for   weeks allowing each man    oz a day were reinforced with  00 men more and hearing that they cannot be relieved till the end of   weeks how many ounces a day must each man have that the provision may last that time  ans   oz  solution  the answer  question    if a quantity of provisions serve   00 men    weeks at the rate of  0 ounces a day for each man how many men will the same provisions maintain for  0 weeks at the rate of   oz a day for each man  ans    0 men  solution  men the answer  question    in what time will the interest of   l   s equal that of   l  s for    days at any rate of interest   ans           days  solution here   and   then as  days the answer  question    a person possessed of of a ship sold of his share for    0l what was the reputed value of the whole at the same rate  ans  0 0l  solution first of  the part sold  then      0    0 x   0 0l the value of the whole ship  question    what sum of money at   per cent will clear   l   s in a year and a halfs time  ans   0l   s     d  solution first     and   l   s      l also     then  the principal required  question    what number is that to which if    of    be added the sum will be    ans       solution first    of   then     0         0       the answer  question  0 a father dying left his son a fortune of which he ran through in   months    of the remainder lasted him a twelvemonth longer after which he had bare   0l left what did his father bequeath him   ans    l   s  d  solution after spending he had remaining  and after spending    of the remainder he had    of that remainder left  therefore    of    of the whole left at last the value of which is   0l  hence  the whole sum bequeathed  question    bought a quantity of goods for   0l and   months after sold it for    l how much per cent per annum did i gain by them  ans  0  solution here        0   the gain of   0 for   months  therefore as   question    a guardian paid his ward   00l for   00l which he had in his hand   years what rate of interest did he allow him  ans   per cent  solution here   00    00 000 the interest of   00 for   years  therefore   question    bought a quantity of goods for   0l ready money and sold it again for  00l payable at the end of   months what was the gain in ready money supposing rebate to be made at   per cent  ans   l   s      d  solution as  the interest of  00l for   months  and therefore  00        its amount for that time  then  the present worth of the  00l  consequently  the gain in ready money    question    a person being asked the hour of the day said the time past noon is equal to ths of the time till midnight what was the time  ans  0 min past    solution here the one part of the    hours which are contained between noon and midnight being of the other the two parts are in the ratio of   to    hence as   0 min the time past noon required  question    a person looking on his watch was asked what was the time of the day who answered it is between   and   but a more particular answer being required he said that the hour and minute hands were then exactly together what was the time  ans        min past    solution as the minute hand goes once round while the hour hand goes but     part in every revolution of the former it goes      more than the latter  now when the first is at    the latter is at   and therefore the next time the former overtakes the latter it will have gone   parts of the    more than this other  then state the increases proportional to the distances as here below  as       0 min  min past   the time sought  question    with    gallons of canary at  s  d a gal i mixed    gal of white wind at  s  0d a gal

s theref the   g or    q must sell for   0s   gal x  s  d  s conseq as       0     0       theref    gal cost  00s  s d    s      d per quart so as to gain  0 per cent question    suppose that i have     of a ship worth   00l what part of her have i left after selling of    of my share and what is it worth  ans     0 worth    l  solution  the part of his share or of     which is sold but when     of any thing is deducted there remains      of the same thing therefore  is the part of the ship remaining  otherwise   the part of the ship sold  therefore  the part of the ship remaining the same as before  then as  the value of the part remaining  question    what length must be cut off a board   inches broad to contain a square foot or as much as    inches in length and    in breadth  ans         inches  solution as  inches in length to be cut off    question    what sum of money will produce as much interest in   years as   0l  s can produce in   years and   months  ans   0l  s  solution first      and   y   m          also   0l  s  0   0  0  0 then as  the sum required  question  0 there is gained by trading with a ship   0l   s now suppose that of her belongs to s to t to v and the rest to w what must each have of the gain  ans s  0l  s  d t   l  s  d v   l  s  d w  0l  s  d  solution first  the sum of s t and vs  therefore        ws share which is the same as that of s also their respective shares are proportional to the numerators of the fractions viz to the numbers         the sum of which is   then as     0l   s or as     l  s  d    0l  s  dss share         ts         vs    0    ws their sum is   0  0the sum given  question    if  00l in   years be allowed to gain  0l  0s in what time will any sum of money double itself at the same rate of interest  ans         years  solution here it is only to find the time in which  00l will gain  00l which is thus  as  0l  0s 0l     00   years  the answer    question    what difference is there between the interest of   0l at   per cent for   years and the discount of the same sum at the same rate and for the same time   ans   l      s  solution first   x     is the interest of  00l for the   years  then  the disc of  00  and  the interest of   0  therefore  the difference required  question    if by selling goods at  0s per cwt i gain  0 per cent what do i gain or lose per cent by selling at   s per cwt   ans  l gain  solution as  the amount or returns of  00 at the rate of    per cwt  therefore  0    00  is the gain per cent  question    if by remitting to holland at   s  d per l sterling   per cent be gained how goes the exchange when by remittance i clear  0 per cent ans   s       0 d  solution first   s  d      and  00    0  0   then  the rate of exchange to gain  0 per cent   question    sold goods for  0 guineas and by so doing lost    per cent whereas i ought in dealing to have cleared  0 per cent then how much under their just value were they sold  ans   l  s    0  d  solution first  00   0  0 and  00       their difference is   0       also  0 guineas  l then  the answer   question    if by selling goods at   d per lb i gain cent per cent what do i clear per cent by selling for   guineas per cwt ans  0 per cent  solution at   d per lb it is per cwt    x    d  x   s  and   guineas  x   s  therefore  the amount of  00 at the latter price  consequently   0   00 0the gain per cent  question    if  0 men can perform a piece of work in    days how many will accomplish another thrice as big in onefifth of the time  ans  00  solution as   x  0   x     x  0 x   00 men the answer  question    a younger brother received   00l which was just    of his elder brothers fortune what was the father worth at his death  ans    00l  solution as the one was    of the other their shares were to each other as   is to   therefore  as            00    x  00   00l the answer  question    a person making his will gave to one child    0 of his estate and the rest to another and when these legacies came to be paid the one turned out  00l more than the other what did the testator die worth  ans  000l  solution as the one had    0 the other must have had   0 and their shares in the ratio of    to   therefore  as              0  00  00 x  0 000l the whole estate  question  0 a father devised     of his estate to one of his sons and     of the residue to another and the surplus to his relict for life the childrens legacies were found to be    l  s  d different pray what money did he leave the widow the use of  ans    l  0  0  d  solution first           the residue after the  st share therefore     of          the  d sons share and  the difference of the sons shares also fince         we have      of               the proportional share of the relict conseq as           l  s  d    l os  0  0  d   question    what number is that from which if you take    of   and to the remainder add     of   0 the sum will be  0   ans  0       0  solution first   and     of   0   0  therefore  the answer  question    there is a number which if multiplied by of of   will produce   what is the square of that number   ans         solution here  the number  and theref    x                   the sq of the numb  question    a person dying left his wife with child and making his will ordered that if she went with a son of his estate should belong to him and the remainder to his mother and if she went with a daughter he appointed the mother and the girl the remainder but it happened that she was delivered both of a son and daughter by which she lost in equity   00l more than if it had been only a girl what would have been her dowry had she had only a son  ans   00l  solution since the sons share is to the mothers as   to   and the mothers to the daughters as   to   therefore their three shares are respectively as the numbers     and   the sum of which is   consequently their real shares are       and     now   theref  the answ  question    three persons purchase together a ship toward the payment of which a advanced    and b    of the value and c  00l how much paid a and b and what part of the vessel had c  ans a  0  0  l b        l c      part  solution first                                          cs part  consequently as     00  paid by a  paid by b   question    a and b clear by an adventure at sea  0 guineas with which they agree to buy a horse and chaise of which they were to have the use in proportion to the sums adventured which was found to be a   to b   they cleared    per cent what money then did each send abroad   ans a   l  s      d and b   l   s       d  solution first  the sum of the adventures  therefore as            0       question    in an article of trade a gains   s  d and his adventure was  0s more than bs whose share of profit is but   s what are the particulars of their stock   ans a  l   s  d and b  l   s  d  solution the difference of the adventures being  0s and the difference of the gains    s  d    s   s  d   s       therefore as      0 or as      0 or as          question    three persons entered joint trade to which a contributed   0l and b   0l they clear   0l of which  0l belongs of right to c required that persons stock and the several gains of the other two   ans cs stock   0l a gained   l and b   l  solution first   0   0 0the sum of the gains of a and b  and   0    0  0the sum of their stocks  therefore as   0  0 or as       0   0   as gain   0   0   bs gain   also as  0   0 or as      0   0cs stock  question    a and b in partnership equally divide the gain as money which was   l   s lay for    months and bs for no more than   what was the adventure of the latter  ans    l  0s  solution since the two shares of the gain are equal by the rule of doublefellowship it appears that the two products are equal which are made by multiplying each stock by its time and consequently that the stocks are inversely or reciprocally as the times hence  as      or as       l   s   l  s x     l  0sthe sum adventured by b  question    put out   0l to interest and in   years time there was sound to be due    l  0s what was the rate of interest  ans   per cent  solution first        0   the interest of   0 for   yrs theref                its interest for   yr then as   0    or as  0    00   therefore the rate of interest was   per cent  question  0 a clears   l in   months b   l in   months and c whose stock was  0l cs   l in   months what was the whole stock  ans       l  solution as      0 0 x   or as     0  the prod of as stock and time  the prod of bs stock and time   then  as stock  bs stock   lastly   0     0    0   00    0          0          the sum of all their stocks as required  question    a had    pipes of wine which he parted with to b at   per cent profit who sold them to c for  0l   s advantage c made them over to d for  0 l  0s and cleared thereby   per cent how much a gallon did this wine cost a  ans  s      0  0  d  solution the    pipes cost d  0 l  0s  therefore as  0   00 or as  the sum they cost c  consequently  the sum they cost b  hence as  the sum the    pipes cost a  the   th part of this is      0  0    the price of   pipe or     gallons  divide now the numerator by     or by its component parts     and   and lastly divide by the denominator for the answer thus   question    a of amsterdam orders b of london to remit to c of paris at   d ster a crown and to draw on d of antwerp for the value at   s slem a l ster but as soon as b received the commission the exchange was on paris at   d a crown pray at what rate of exchange ought b to draw on d to execute his orders and be no loser   ans   s      d  solution as  the answer required    question    a with intention to clear  0 guineas on a bargain with b rates hops at   d a lb which cost him  0d b apprized of that sets down malt which cost  0s a quarter at an adequate price for how much malt did they contract  ans    qrs  solution as  the gain per quarter  then as  the number of quarters required  question    a and b venturing equal sums of money clear by joint trade   0l by agreement a was to have   per cent because he spent time in the execution of the project and b was to have only   what was allotted to a for his trouble  ans   l  0s      d  solution as  the answer required  question    laid out in a lot of muslin  00l upon examination of which   parts in   proved damaged so that i could make but  s a yard of the same and by so doing find i lost  0l by it at what rate per ell am i to part with the undamaged muslin in order to gain  0l upon the whole   ans   s     d  solution in order to gain  0l by the whole he must gain  00l by the undamaged part because he lost  0l by the part which was damaged  now the part damaged was and the rest also the whole cost  00l the of which is     and the of it is     consequently the damaged part was sold for       0 or     and the sound part must be sold for          00  but the damaged part sold at  s per yard therefore as  s or l    l   yd     x      yards the quantity which was damaged and the double of it or     yards was the undamaged part which must sell for    l therefore as                     by multiplying the terms both by     00  00    l the price per yard  and consequently as  the price per ell required  otherwise  since the sound part is the double of the part damaged and the former must gain a sum just the double of that which was lost by the latter it is evident that it must be sold at a rate as much above the prime cost as the other was below it  now the loss on part was  0l at which rate the whole  00 would have brought only   0 therefore as   0  00 or as    0  s  0     s the prime cost per yard  hence            the loss per yard on the damaged part and               s the price per yard of the sound part  lastly as               x       x        s the price per ell the same as before  question    a at paris draws on b in london   00 crowns at   d ster a crown for the value of which b draws again on a at   d sterling a crown besides reckoning commission per cent did a gain or lose by this transaction and what  ans he gained         crowns  solution first   00 x      00 pence the value of as draft on b  then as  00  00 or as  00  0     00     x  0 dthe sum that b must draw for at   d per crown  therefore as  crowns which b must draw for  consequently   00                  crowns is as gain    question    a b and c are in company a put in his share of the stock for   months and laid claim to of the profits b put in his for   months c advanced  00l for   months

payments than two should be omitted as that method of equating for   or more payments will not give the answer strictly true but in all such cases to obtain the just answer malcolms general principle of solution ought to be used viz making the interests of the sums that are kept till after they are due equal to the discounts of those which are paid before they are due the resolution of the resulting equation will indeed require some knowledge in algebra but for ordinary purposes the rule in common use will bring out answers sufficiently near the truth  lately published in six volumes
