a discourse on the miracles of our savior  in view of the present controversy between infidels and apostates   nostrum est tantas componere lites by thomas woolston sometime fellow of sidney college in cambridge  london printed for the author sold by him near moregate and by the booksellers of london and westminster price one shilling  to the right reverend father in god edmund lord bishop of london my lord upon no other view do i make a dedication of this discourse to your lordship than to submit it to your acute judgment expecting soon to hear of your approbation or dislike of it if it so happen that you highly approve of it i beg of you to be sparing of your commendations least i should be puffed up with them  in my moderator some expressions dropped from ny pen about the miracles of our savior which for want of illustration then gave your lordship some offense and brought upon me more trouble but having now fully and clearly explained my self out of the fathers i hope you will be reconciled to me and as you are a lover of truth will against interest and prejndice yield to the force of it  whether your prosecution of me for the moderator was just and reasonable i will not dispute here having already expostulated that matter with you in several letters to which you would not condescend to give me any answer for what reason you was silent is best known to your self but in my own vindication i hope i muy publish without offense that your taking me for an infidel was such a mistake as i thought no schoar could have made and the injury done to my reputation and low fortunes by the prosecution so considerable that the least i expected from your lordship was a courteous excuse if not an ample compensation for it  as to the expediency of prosecuting infidels for their writings in whose cause i am the farthest of any man from being engaged i will here say nothing the argument pro and con has already by one or other been copiously handled and i dont know but i might be with your lordship on the persecuting side of the question but that it looks as if a man was distrustful of the truth of christianity and conscious of his own inability to defend it or he would leave that good cause to god himself and the sword of the spirit without calling upon the civil magistrate for his aid and assistance  that scurvy writer of the scheme of litteral prophecy etc which your lordship must have heard of would insinuate that they are only atheistical priests who for fear of their interests in the church set persecutions on foot but after your lordship has published a strenuous defense of christianity to the purpose of our present controversy i will have no such suspicions of you  your lordships persecuting or if you will prosecuting humor is reputedly all pure zeal for gods glory and with all my heart let it be so accounted whether it be according to knowledge or not against popery and infidelity you are all ardency who does not commend you who can question the sincerity of the zeal of a protestant bishop and of a prostestant clergy when they persecute the enemies of their church that considers their own steadiness to principles against interest under all changes since the reformation and their abhorrence of extortion upon the people for the dutys of their function in and about this city such honesty and constancy in their profession is a proof of the integrity of their hearts or i know not where to find one  but that your lordships zeal for religion is very remarkable and successful i could prove by many instances one is that of your routing a turbulent sect of peripateticks our of st pauls cathedral and if you could as effectually clear christs church of infidels what a glorious bishop would you be  and what pity is it that infidels likewise are not to be quelled with your threats and terrors which without the weapons of sharp reasonings and thumping arguments that others are for the use of would transmit your fame to posterity for a notable champion for christianity as certainly as that your judicious prosecution of the moderator for infidelity is here remembrd by  my lord the admirer of your zeal wisdom and conduct thomas woolston london april   th      a discourse on the miracles of our savior etc if ever there was an useful controversy started or revived in this age of the church it is this about the messiahship of the holy jesus which the discourse of the grounds etc has of late raised i believe this controversy will end in the absolute demonstration of jesuss messiahship from prophecy which is the only way to prove him to be the messiah that great prophet expected by the jews and promised under the old testament and though this way of proof from prophecy seems to labor under many difficulties at present and though some writers against the grounds being distressed with those difficulties are foeeking refuge in the miracles of our savior yet we must persist in it till what i have no doubt of his messiahship shall be clearly made out by it  and the way in prophecy that i would take for the proof of jesuss messiahship should be by an allegorical interpretation and application of the law and the prophets to him the very same way that all the fathers of the church have gone in and the very same way in which all the ancient jews say their messiah was to fulfill the law and the prophets but this way does not please our ecclesiastical writers in this controversy neither will they at present give any ear to it  the way in prophecy that they are for taking is by a litteral interpretation and applcation of some prophecys of the old testament to our jesus but they are hitherto unsuccessful in this way the authors of the grounds and of the scheme grievously perplex them with their objections against this way of proof so far as being sensible i say of almost insuperable difficultys in it they are flying apace to the miracles of our savior as to their sole and grand refuge  but to show that there is no sanctuary for them in the miracles of our savior i write this discourse and this i do not for the service of infidelity which has no place in my heart but for the honor of the holy jesus and to reduce the clergy to the good old way of interpreting prophecys which the church has unhappily apostatisd from and which upon the testimony of the fathers will one day be the conversion of jews and gentiles  for this opinion that there is no sanctuary in the miracles of our savior i chanced to say in the moderator page    that jesuss miracles as they are now a days understood make nothing for his authority and messiahship and again p    that i believe upon good authority some of the miracles of jesus as recorded by the evangelists were never wrought but are only related as prophetical and parabolical narratives of what will be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him which expressions gave offense to some of our clergy and brought upon me their indignation and displeasure i see no reason to depart from the said expressions or so much as to palliate and soften them much less to retract them but in maintenance of my opinion to the honor of our messiah and and the defense of christianity i write this treatise on jesuss miracles and take this method following  i i will show that the miracles of healing all manner of bodily diseases which jesus was justly famed for are none of the proper miracles of the messiah neither are they so much as a good proof of his divine authority to found a religion  ii that the litteral history of many of the miracles of jesus as recorded by the evangelists does imply absurditys improbabilities and incredibilitys consequently they either in whole or in part were never wrought as they are commonly believed now a days but are only related as prophetical and parabolical naratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  iii i shall consider what jesus means when he appeals to his miracles as to a testimony and witness of his divine authority and show that he could not properly and ultimately referr to those he then wrought in the flesh but to those mystical ones which he would do in the spirit of which those wrought in the flesh are but mere types and shadows  in treating on these heads i shall not confine my self only to reason but also to the express authority of the fathers those holy venerable and learned preachers of he gospel in the first ages of the church who took our religion from the hands of the apostles and of apostolical men who died some of them and suffered for the doctrine they taught who professedly and confessedly were endewd with divine and extraordinary gifts of the spirit who consequently cannot be supposed to be corrupters of christianity or teachers of false notions about the miracles of our savior of so much as mistaken about the apostolical and evangelical sense and nature of them i know not how it comes to pass but i am a profound admirer and an almost implicit believer of the authority of the fathers whom i look upon as vast philosophres very great scholars and most orthodox divines whatever they concurrently assert i firmly believe and though they are for the most part mysterious writers out of the reach of the capacitys of many who slight them yet i who have had the honor and happiness of much of their acquaintance fancy my self well apprised of their meanings if at any time i read a passage in them which i dont presently apprehend i salute it with veneration for all that till my understanding is opened to receive the sense of it if i meet with but a single opinion in any one of them i pay my respects to it but where there is an harmony and agreement of opinion amongst them it is with me and ought to be with all christians of such weight as to bear down all prejudice opposition and contradiction before it or the authority of no man whether ancient or modern is to have any regard paid to it and of what ill consequence to religion such an utter rejection of authority will be i need not say  this i thought fit to premise concerning the authority of the fathers to abate of the prejudice beforehand which some may conceive against the following discourse about the miracles of jesus i dont question but some may be startled at the foregoing heads as if what is the farthest of any thing from my heart the service of infidelity was in view but craving the temper and patience of such readers for a while and they shall find that it is no other than just reasoning clear truth and primitive doctrine about jesuss miracles that i advance or if it should so happen that none besides my self should discern the reasoning and truth of the argument yet i hope it will not be thought a crime to revive primitive doctrine which none will be able to deny it to be whether they like it or not if i err i err upon choice with the fathers of whose faith i am and if any are offended at what follows about the miracles of christ let them turn their displeasure and indignation against the fathers for whose express or implicit opinions i can be deserving of no blame  i am sorry for the occasion of such a preface against offense which the apostasy of the age and its unacquaintedness with the fathers has made necessary so i enter upon the particular handling of the heads foregoing and  i i will show that the miracles of healing all manner of bodily diseases which jesus was justly famed for are none of the proper miracles of the messiah nor are they so much as a good proof of jesuss divine authority to found and introduce a religion into the world  and to do this let us consider first in general what was the opinion of the fathers about the writings of the evangelists in which the life of christ is recorded eucherius says universam porro sacram scripturam tam novi quam veteris testamenti ad allegoricum sensum esse sumendam admonet nos vel illud aperiam os meum in parabolis in prasat ad form spirit intell that the scriptures of the new as well as old testament are to be interpreted in an allegorical sense and this his opinion is no other than the common one of the first ages of the church as might be proved by many the like expressions of other fathers as in such expressions they do not except the writings of the evangelists so they must include the history of christs miracles which as well as other parts of the hystory of his life is to be allegorizd for the sake of its true meaning consequently the litteral story of christs miracles proves nothing  but let us hear particularly their opinion of the actions and miracles of our savior origin says that si quidem symbola quaedam erant quae tunc gerebantur eorum quae jesu virtute semper preficiuntur in mat c xv whatsoever jesus did in the flesh was but typical and symbolical of what he would do in the spirit and to our purpose omnis languor and omnis infirmitas quam sanavit salvator tunc in populo referuntur ad infirmitates spirituals animarum etc in mat c xvii that the several bodily diseases which he healed were no other than figures of the spiritual infirmities of the soul that are to be cured by him st hilary is of the same mind with origin as any one may see by the christi gesta aliud portendunt in mat c    evangelicis gestis est interior sensus c    haec licet in praesens gesta sunt quid tamen in futurum significent contuendum est c  0 peragunt forma futuri gesta praesentia c    expressions referred to and his commentary on st matthew st augustine quoe a jesu facta sunt alicujus significantia erant sermon    and st john omne quod fecit jesus sacramenta sunt homil    in marc   of jerusalem both say that the works of jesus import farther mysteries and with them the rest of the fathers agree making the miracles that jesus did then no more than the shadow of some more powerful and mystical operations to be done by him as i could show by more citations out of them if it was needful but from the foregoing citations out of the fathers it is plain in their opinion that our modern divines are in the wrong of it to lay much stress on any of the operations of jesus which he did in the flesh for the proof of his divine authority and messiahship which is only to be proved by his more mysterious works of which those done in the flesh were but type and figure  but to come closer to the purpose let us see how indifferently i had almost said contemptibly the fathers speak of the miracles of jesus and particularly of his power of healing all bodily diseases which by modern writers is so much magnified and extolled st irenaeus says si enim temporalis erat ab eo utilitas nihil grande praestitit iis qui ab eo curati sunt lv c    s   that if we consider only the then temporal use of jesuss power of healing he did nothing grand and wonderful consequently irenaeus could not hold that jesuss miracles then wrought were a sufficient proof of his divine authority much less of his messiahship origin says contra celsum l    that though many were brought to believe in jesus upon the fame of the miracles which he did once among the jews yet what implies the insufficiency of them for the conversion of men he intimates that his greater and mystical works do prove his authority st john of jerusalem says coecum curavit magnum quidem est quod fecit sed nisi quotidie fiat quod olim factum nobis quidem magnum esse cessavit homil  0 in marc   that jesuss cures performed upon the blind etc were indeed considerable and great but unless he do daily as mighty works in his church we ought to forbear our admiration of him st augustine not only says si humano captu and ingenio consideremus jesum facientem and quod ad potestatem non magnum aliquid fecit and quod ad benignitatem parvum secit in johan cap v tract    that if we examine into jesuss miracles by humane reason we shall find he did nothing great considering his almighty power and considering his goodness what he did was but little but he tells us also that etsi attestabantur miracula non defuissent sicut and nunc mussitant qui magicae potentiae cuncta illa tribuerent cont faust l xii c    such works as jesus did might be imputed to and effected by magic art and accordingly moses and our savior himself confess that false prophets and false christs will do miracles and antichrist himself according to st paul will do them to the deception of mankind nay the fathers vid sanctum augustinum de antichristo say what i believe that antichrist will imitate and equal jesus in all his miracles which he wrought of old how then can we distinguish the true prophet from the false the true christ from the anti christ by miracles our divines will find it hard to do it if what the fathers say of antichrist be found true moreover history affords us instances of men such as of apollonius tyanaeus vespasian and of the irish stroker greatrex who have miraculously cured diseases to the admiration of mankind as well as our jesus but if any of them or any other greater worker of miracles than they were should withal assume to himself the title of a prophet and author of a new religion i humbly conceive we ought not to give heed to him  neither is there the least reason that we should for the power of doing miracles is no certain nor rational seal of the commission and authority of a divine lawgiver st paul says i corinth c xii there is a diversity of the gifts of the spirit for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge to another the gift of healing to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues these gifts may be given a part and separately one of them may be conferred on this man and another of them on his neighbor there is no necessity that any two or more of these gifts should meet in one man to argue then that a man who has one of these gifts must needs have the other that is that he must needs have the gift of wisdom or of prophecy or of discerning of spirits or of diverse kinds of tongues because he has the gift of healing and of working miracles is very inconclusive and false reasoning and yet this is the reasoning of our modern writers who would prove jesuss authority to found a religion from his miracles i dont question but jesus had all the foresaid gifts and powers of the spirit in a most superlative degree but then it is unreasonably inferred for all that that a man because he of certainty has some of them must of consequence have the other st augustine atque illud ad rem maxim partineat ne decipiamur tendentes ad contemplationem veritatisarbitrantes ibi osse invisibilem sapientiam ubi miraculum visibile viderimus in sermon dom in montc l   sect    cautions us against being deceived into a good opinion of a mans wisdom because of his power to do miracles and i think accordingly that we may as well say that the strongest man is the wisest or that a good physician must needs be a good casuist or that the best mathematician is the ablest statesman as that jesus because he was a worker of miracles such as his are and a healer of all manner of diseases ought to be received as the guide of our consciences the director of our understandings the ruler of our hearts and the author of a religion  what then will the writers against the grounds do to prove jesuss authority and messiahship from his miracles or how by his miracles will they be able to distinguish him from an impostor a false prophet and the antichrist why they will say perhaps    that besides greatness of power there was nothing but goodness kindness and love to mankind shown in jefuss miracles as to the miracles of false prophets and impostors if they be many of them of a kind and benevolent aspect yet the devils foot if we look well to it will discover it self in some ludicrous and mischeivous pranks but jesuss miracles were all of a beneficent nature he went about doing good healing all manner of diseases among the people and did no wrong to any one which is a good argument they say of his divine authority or god would not have suffered nor the devil have worked such a testimony in behalf of it on this head our divines are copious and rhetorical and many notable and florid harangues have they made on it but  in answer to them they dont seem to have their memories at hand when they declaim at this rate the fathers upon whose authority i write will tell such orators that jesus if his miracles are to be understood in the litteral sense did not only as foolish things as any impostor could do but very injurious ones to mankind i shall not here instance in the seemingly foolish and injurious things which jesus did for miracles intending under the next head to speak to some of them but they are such if literally true as out divines do believe as are enough to turn our stomachs against such a prophet and enough to make us take him for a conjuror a sorcerer and a wizard rather than the messiah and prophet of the most high god but    to prove the messiahship of the holy jesus from his miracles our divines urge the prophecys of the old testament such as that of isaiah c xxxv v     then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstoppd then shall the lame man leap as the heart and the tongue of the dumb sing and say that these prophecys were accurately fulfilled by our jesus in the several specifical cures of blindness deafness lameness and dumbness which he often performed upon one or other and in as much as our savior seems to appeal to such prophecys do conclude this his accomplishment of them to be no less than a demonstration that he was the true messiah that great prophet who was to came into the world to which i answer  first that the accomplishment of prophecys that can neither be given forth by human foresight nor fulfilled in a counterfeit are good proofs of jesuss messiahship but then what shall we say if others besides jesus should do the like cures and miracles it is said of antichrist and i believe it that he will not only do all the miracles that jesus did but will appeal to the like prophecys too how then we are to distinguish the true christ from the false christ by miracles and prophecys in this case is the question which i leave with our divines to consider of an answer to against the time that it is proved that antichrist does all those miracles which jesus in the flesh wrought but  secondly the foresaid prophecys and others mentioned in isaiah neither were nor could be prophecys of the miraculous cures of bodily diseases which jesus then did and this may be made appear not only from the context of those prophecys which received then no accomplishment from jesus who ought to have fulfilled one part of the prophecy as well as the other or is not to be taken for the fulfiller of either bur from the opinion of both jews and fathers who adjourn the accomplishment of those prophecys to christs spiritual advent but  thirdly the prophet isaiah in the place above cited speaks not of bodily blindness which the messiah is to heal but of the spiritual distempers of the soul metaphorically so called as may be easily proved not only from the prophecys themselves but from the old jews who were allgorical interpreters of those distempers and from the ancient fathers interim completur et isaiae prophetia non tantum in corporalibus verum etiam in spiritualibus origin in matt cap xv aperientur igitur oculi caecorum aures surdorum audient nam qui quondam divinis sermonibus rejectis mysticam sanctorum institutionem recipere non studuerunt libenter eam admittent st cyril in loc is vide et sanctum hieronymum in loc isai who so understood them consequently our jesuss healing of those bodily diseases was no proper accomplishment of those prophecys it is true our savior matt xi     seems to appeal to those prophecys and to make his cure of corporal distempers an accomplishment of them but he means not in the litteral sense that our divines take him in as i shall show hereafter when i come to consider what jesus means by appealing to his works and miracles as bearing witness of him  our divines then may admire and adore jesus as much as they please for his miracles of healing bodily distempers but i am for the spiritual messiah that cures those distempers of the soul that metaphorically pass under the names of blindness lameness deafness etc and the cure of these spiritual diseases is the proper and miraculous work of the true messiah for the sake of which says et nunc majores sanitates operatur propter quas non est dedignatus tune exhibere illas minores in sermon    st augustine jesus condescended to do those little miracles of healing bodily distempers which were but the type and shadow of his more stupendous miracles of curing spiritual diseases the cure of spiritual infirmities is a godlike in quibus spiritualibus maxim christi persona eminet august quaest   in lucam work above the imitation of man or of antichrist infinitely more miraculous than the healing any bodily distempers can be  whether our jesus be at this day such a spiritual messiah i leave to our divines to consider with those spiritual distempers of the church that seem to want his miraculous hand and touch the fathers of the church said that jesus was in part such a spiritual messiah in their time and argued modo caro caeca non aperit oculos miraculo domini sed cor caecum aperit oculos sermoni domini modo non refurgit mortale cadaver sed resurgit anima quae mortua jucebat in vivo cadavere etc august sermon    s   his messiahship not from bodily cures but from his most miraculous cures of the diseases of the soul but there was another and future time in which he would be such a spiritual and glorious messiah to the greatest perfection in the mean while no healing of corporal distempers can prove jesus to be the messiah nor any other of his miraculous works recorded in the evangelists so far from it that  ii i shall prove that the litteral story of many of jesuss miracles as they are recorded in the evangelists and commonly believed by christians does imply improbabilities and incredibilities and the grossest absuidities very dishonorable to the name of christ consequently they in whole or in part were never wrought but are only related as prophetical and parabolical naratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  the reading of this head will i doubt not strike with horror some of our squeamish divines who notwithstanding they will sacrifice almost any principles to their interest will not bear that our litteral evangelical history of such renowned miracles should be thus called in question and contemptuously spoken of what does this author mean will some say thus to do service to atheism and infidelity away with him our indignation is moved against him no censure and punishment can be too severe for such impiety profaneness and blasphemy as is aimed at and implied in this proposition  to calm therefore the spirits and abate the prejudices of such accusers i must proceed with the greater caution and with reason and authority well fortify my self before and behind or i shall feel the weight of the displeasure of our divines who are prepossessed of the belief of the litteral story of all jesuss miracles  before then i enter upon the particular examination of any of his miracles i will premise two or three general assertions of the fathers about them and first origin historia scripturae interdum interserit quaedam vel minus gesta vel quae omnino geri non possunt interdum quae possunt geri nec tamen gesta sunt de principiis lib   says that in the historical part of the scriptures there are some things inscrted as history which were never transacted and which it was impossible should be transacted and other things again that might possibly be done but were not this he asserts of the writings of the evangelists as well as of the old testament and gives many instances to this purpose st hilary multa sunt quae non sinunt nos simplici sensu dicta evangelica suscipere interpositis euim nonnullis rebus quae ex natura humani sensus sibi contraria sunt rationem quaerere caelestis intellgentiae admonemur in matt l xx s   says there are many historical passages of the new testament that if they are taken literally are contrary to sense and reason and therefore there is a necessity of a mystical interpretation and st augustine evangelica sacramenta in christi factis signata omnibus non patent et ea nonnulli minus diligenter interpretando afferunt plerumque pro salute perniciem et pro cognitione veritatis errorem etc de quest diverse quest    says that there are hidden mysterys in the works and miracles of our savior which if we incaiously and literally interpret we shall run into errors and make grievous blunders of the same mind are the rest of the fathers as might be proved by express or implicit citations but studying brevity i think the three testimonys above enough to cool the rage and assuage the prejudices of my adversaries against the proposition before us which i now come to a particular consideration of that is to show that the story of many of jesuss miracles is literally absurd improbable and incredible and    to speak to that miracle of jesuss driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple which all the matt c xxi mark c xi luke c xix john c ii four evangelists make mention of  i have read in some modern author whose name dos not occur to my memory that this was in his opinion the most stupendous miracle that jesus wrought and in truth it was a most astonishing one if literally true and jesus must appear more than a man he must put on an awful and most majestic countenance to effect it it is hard to conceive how any one in the form of a man and of a despised one too and we dont read that jesus changed his human shape with a whip in his hand could execute such a work upon a great multitude of people who were none of his disciples nor had any regard for him supposing he could by his divine power infuse a pannick fear into the people yet what was the reason that he was so eaten up with zeal against the profanation of that house which he himself came to destroy and which he permitted i may say commanded to be filthily polluted not long after put not to form by my self an lnvective against the letter of this story let us hear what the fathers say to it  origin makes the whole but a in comment in matt c xxi parable his allegorical expositions of it are frequent and one time or other he gives us the mystical meaning of every part of it by the temple he understands the church by the sellers in the temple he means such preachers who make merchandise of the gospel whom the spirit of christ some time or other would rid his church of he is so far from believing any thing of the letter of this story that he has formed a porro cui curae est accuratior inquisitio considerabit an juxta dignitatem praesentis vitae erat ut jesus rem talem auderet facere extrudere videlicet mercatorum multiudinem qui ad diem festum ascenderant distributuri boves ditioribus et tanto populo oves mactandas per domos familiarium quae multorum millium complerent numerum atque eos qui in rebus talibus gloriantes producturi erant in medio columbas quas multi empturi erant ceu in conventu celeberrimo convivaturi considerabit hic etiam an nummulariorum erat non accusare jesum contumeliose propter suas ipsorum effusas pecunias et mensas subversas quis antem flagello e funiculis verberatus et expulsus ab eo qui penes eos habebatur vilis hunc adortus non inclamasset totis viribus sese ulciscens cum praesertim haberet tantam multitudinem eorum qui sibi aeque contumeliam fieri credebant faventem sibi adversum jesum insuper censideremus dei filium funiculos sumentem sibique flagellum tenentem ad extrudendum e templo annon repraesentet praeter audaciam and temeritatem inordinatum etiam quiddam in johan tom xi large argument against it the substance of which is that if jesus had attempted any such thing the people would have resisted and executed their revenge on him if he had effected it the merchants of the temple might have reproached him with damage done to their wares and would have justly accused him of a riot against law and authority whether there is not reason in this argument of origin let any one judge  st hilary is of the same mind with origin he says that this story is only a praefiguratio futurorum dictis praesentibus continetur in matt c xxi praefiguration of what will be done in christs church upon another occasion and he admonishes admonemur altius verborum virtutes in istius modi significationibus contuendas ibid us to search into the profound and mystical import of every part of it particularly he hints that in cathedra est sacordotii seeds et eorum qui spiritus sancti donum venale habent cathedras evertet ibid by the seats of those who sell doves may be understood the pulpits of preachers who make sale of the gifts of the spirit which is represented by a dove as to the letter of the story he is plain enough that there was no such non habebant judaei quod venire possent neque erat quod emere quis posset ibid market kept in the temple of jerusalem and if any historians besides the evangelists had asserted it i know of none who would have been so foolish as to believe that oxen and sheep and goats were there sold  st ambrose too is for the mystery and against the letter of this story saying cathedra autem vendentium columbas cur everterit secundum litteram non intellgo admonet typo ejectorum de templo hujusmodi mercatorum in ecclesia dei cousortium eos habere non posse qui sancti spiritus gratiam nundinentur in loc luc what should be the reason that jesus should overturn the seats of those that sold doves this must be says he a figurative story and signifies nothing less than the future ejection of priests out of his church who shall make gain and merchandise of the gospel  st jerome as his manner is in other cases first gives us a litteral exposition of this miracle as far as it will bear it but then corrects himself again saying there are juxta simplicem intelligentim  quod penitus absurdum  caeterum secundum mysticos intellectus jesus ingreditur templum patris et ejicit omnes episcopos presbyteros et diaconos etc in loc mat absurditys in the letter but according to its mystical meaning jesus will enter his temple of the church and cast out of it bishops priests and deacons who make a trade of preaching and in another place he tells us of the mystical faciet dominus flagellum de scripturarum textuum testinoniis in zechar c xiv whip that jesus will make use of to this purpose  st augustine also is against the letter of the story of this miracle saying non magnum peccatum si hoc vendebant in templo quod emebatur ut offerretur in templo in loc johan where could be the great sin of selling and buying things in the temple that were for the use of it and offered as sacrifice in it we must therefore says he look for the mystery in this qui sunt tamen qui boves vendunt ut in figura quaeramus mysterium facti qui sunt qui oves vendunt et columbas ipsi sunt qui sua quaerunt in ecclesia non quae jesu christi ibid figurative story and enquire what is meant by the oxen and sheep and doves and who are the sellers of them in christs church and he is very positive that ecclesiastics who are selfish and make worldly gain of the gospel are here meant and as to the expression of turning the temple into a den of theives he says it has respect to the vox enim fecistis domum meum domum negotiationis etspeluncam latronum significat futuros in ecclesia l ii evang quaest quast    clergy in time to come who would make such a den of christs church  lastly with the foregoing fathers agrees st theophylact who is an allegorist too upon this miracle saying that those  in johan c ii who sell doves are the priests who sell spiritual gifts and that christ sometime or other would overturn their seats and clear his church of them in another place he intimates what are meant by oxen and sheep viz the litteral sense of the scriptures and if the litteral sense be irrational and nonsensical the metaphor we must allow to be proper in as much as nowadays dull and foolish and absurd stuff we call bulls falings and blunders  behold a wonderful harmony among the fathers in their rejection of litteral and espousal of the mystical sense of this miracle it is said of the church in her first ages that she was inspired and so she was or before an hire for the priesthood was established and pleaded for she could never have written in this fashion if the fathers had lived now and written thus we should have thought the spirit of quakerism was gotten amongst them or they would never have given such an exposition of this story of favor an enmity to an hireling priesthood  how and when chrissts power according to the figure and parable before us will enter his church and drive out of her these ecclesiastical merchants is not the question but when ever it dos so effectually it will be a stupendous miracle much greater than the typical one is supposed to be and not only a proof of christs divine power and presence in his church but an absolute demonstration of his messiahship from his accomplishment both of the foresaid prophecys of the fathers and of other remarkable ones of the old testament which will be then clearly understood and which it is not my business here to apply or mention  against the aforesaid exposition of this miracle perhaps it may be objected that excepting a little reasoning against the letter of it this is only the chimerical and whimsical dream of the fathers whose notions are obsolete and who chandlers vindication etc p     have adulterated christianity with their cant and jargan and that none of our protestant and orthodox divines have ever given into their opinion  i confess that that none of our protestant divines whom i know do embrace the foresaid exposition of the fathers but it may be nothing the worse for all that and though their exposition may be very disagreeable to the priesthood of this age yet i can tell them of the greatest man of these last ages and that was erasmus who cautiously expressing himself for fear of giving offense to the clergy is of the same mind with the fathers or he would not say that hoc facto long aliud significabat jesus nec enim illum tantopere commovebat templum illud mercimoniis boum ovium hircorum et columbarum profanatum sed oftendere voluit avaritiam et quaestum fore capitalem pestem ecclesiae quam templum cujus religio mox erat abolenda figurabat  in nullum hominum genus acrius saeviit jesus sed hos ipse sibi servavit ejiciendos cum videbitur in loc matt c xxi that work of jesus did prefigure somewhat else for jesus could not be zealous against the profanation of that temple of the jews which was soon to be destroyed but meant to show his dislike and hatred of ecclesiastical covetousness which after the way of the type he would take his opportunity to rid the church of  before i dismiss this miracle i must observe that if the fathers are right above then out latin and english translations of the place in st matthew err in a main point instead of reading and jesus cast out them that sold and bought it should be those who sold and preached that is sold what they preached for the word  does more properly signify to preach than to buy and in this sense here according to the fathers it should be construed  again i must observe that our commentators are a little perplexed to know who and what those  money changers were the greek vid suicerum in  word dos import those who have a knack to barter away little base and brass money with the effigies of an ox or bull on it in exchange for good coin how applicable the word was to any merchants of the old temple at jerusalem is hard to conceive but it is very agreeable to our ecclesiastical collybists who as i may appeal to freethinkers vend their brasenfaced bulls and blunders at an extravagant and great price and if  which is translated tables does properly signify  apud aristophanem est pulpitum vide scapulam pulpits who can help it  so much then on the miracle of jesuss driving the sellersand buyers out of the temple and now i appeal to our divines whether it be not an absurd improbable and incredible story according to the letter and whether it be any other than as the fathers said of it a prophetical and parabolical narative of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by jesus and so i come to speak to a    second miracle of jesus and that is that of his matt c viii mark c v luke c viii casting the devils out of the madman or madmen and permitting them to enter into the herd of swine which thereupon ran down a precipice and were all choked in the sea  to exorcise or cast devils out of the possessed without considering the nature of such a possession or the nature and power of the devil well allow to be not only a kind and beneficent act but a great miracle but then be the miracle as great as can be imagined it is no more than what false teachers luke c xiii v    workers of iniquity and even some artists amongst the jews have before done consequently such a work of exorcism in our savior could be no proof of his divine authority and if there was no more to be said against this miracle this is enough to set it aside and to spoil the argument of jesuss divine power from it but there are many circumstances in the story literally considered that would induce us to call the truth of the whole into question how came those madmen to have their dwelling amongst the tombs of a burying ground where was the humanity of the people that did not take care of them in pity to them as well as for the safety of others or if no chains as the text says which is hardly credible could hold them it was possible surely as well as lawful to dispatch them rather than their neighbors and passengers should be in danger from them believe then this part of the story who can but what is worse its not credible there was any herd of swine in that country if any historians but the evangilists has said so none would have believed it the jews are forbidden to eat swines flesh what then should they do with swine which are good for nothing till they are dead who eat neither pigg pork nor bacon some may say that they were kept there for the use of strangers but this could not be because that after the time of antiochus who polluted the temple with the sacrifice of an hog the jews spencer de legibus hebraep    forbid under the pain of an anathema the keeping of any swine in their country perhaps is may be said that the gadarens so called from the place of their abode were not jews but neighboring gentiles with whom it was lawful to eat and keep swine we will suppose so though it is improbable but then it is unlikely without better reason than at present we are apprised of that our savior would permit the devils to enter into a herd of them to their destruction where was the goodness and justice of his so doing let our divines account for it if they can it is commonly said of our savior and i believe it that his life was entirely innocent that his miracles were all useful and beneficial to maniind and that he did no wrong to any one but how can this be rightly said of him if this story be literally true the proprietors of the swine were great losers and sufferers and we dont read that jesus make them amends or that they deserved such usage from him the proprietors of the swine it seems upon this damage done them by jesus desire him to depart out of their coasts to prevent farther mischief which was gentler resentment than we can imagine any others would have made of the like injury i know not what our divines think of this part of the story nor wherefore jesus escaped so well but if any exorcist in this our age and nation had pretended to expel the devil out of one possessed and permitted him to enter into a flock of sheep the people would have said that he had bewitched both and our laws and judges too of the last age would have made him to swing for it  without offense i hope i have argued against the letter of this strange story of the holy jesus i should not have dared to have said so much against it but upon the encouragement of origin and other fathers who say we ought to expose the absurdities of the letter as much as may be to turn mens heads to the mystical and true meaning  let us hear then what the fathers say to this miracle origens commentaries on this part of st matthew and st lukes gospel are lost otherwise unquestionably he would not only have told us that he believed no more of the letter of this story than he did of the devils l iv de principiis taking our savior to the top of a mountain and showing him all the kingdoms of the world but as he is an admirable mystist would have given us curious light into the allegory and mystery of it but without origin we have enough in the other fathers against the letter of this story  st hilary reckoning up all the parts of this miracle together says of it that it is hanc habeant causam ut esset in rebus gerendis futuri plena meditatio in loc matt in hoc typica ratio servata est ibid typical and parabolical and written for our meditation of what would be done hereafter by the holy jesus according to him and other fathers the madman is mankind or if they were two they were jew and gentile at christs coming who may be said to significatae sunt gentes quae multis daemonibus serviebant augustine in luc quaest    be possessed with devils in as much as they were under the rule of diabolical sins and subject to the worship of  false deities which we translate devils they were so fierce humanum genus ad adventum domini vexabatur furore dementi rumpens vincula rationis st amb in loc luc as no chains could hold them because of their most furious rage and enmity to the church whom no bonds of reason could restrain from doing violence to the christians they are said to be nudus quicunque tegumentum naturae suae and virtutis amisit amb ibid naked because they were destitute of the clothing of the spirit and of grace and may be said to be among the in tumulis sepulchrorum quid enim aliud sunt corpora perfidorum nisi quaedam defunctorum sepulchra in quibus dei verbum non habitat ibid tombs because they were dead in trespasses and sins after that jesus had exorcisd these diabolical spirits out of the gentiles and brought them to their right senses which was upon their conversion to the faith then a good way off some ages after did the like devils by divine permission enter into a videntes daemones non sibi jam locum in gentibus derelinqui ut patiatur habitare se in haereticis deprecantur hilar in loc matt herd of swine i e into heretics of impure lives and furious natures what sort of heretics are meant or whether they are not to be understood of christians in general let our divines consider but one would be apt to think that ministers of the letter are included littera est palea and frequenter evenit ut homines hujus soeculi mystica nescientes simplici scripturarum lectione pascuntur hieron in isa c xi because the letter of the scripture is mystically called swines food i am not obliged to pursue the mystical interpretation of this parable for so i will call it through all its parts nor to say what is meant by the sea that the swine are to be absorpt in but leave our divines to chew upon this mystical construction given them in part and to consider whether there is not a necessity for such an interpretation to make the story credible  and thus have i given you the opinion and exposition of the fathers upon this miracle which they turn all into mystery if our divines are still for adhering to the letter of this story let them account for the difficulties it is involved with to cure men violently distracted and possessed with devils is whether it be miraculous or not a good and great work but to send the devils who without jesuss permission could not go into the herd of swine was an injury done to the proprietors and unbecoming of the goodness of the holy jesus neither is there any other way to solve the difficulty than by looking upon the whole with the fathers as type and figure  if this miraculous story had been recorded of mahomet and not of jesus our divines i dare say would have worked it up to a confutation of mahometanism mahomet should have been with them nothing less than a wizard an enchanter a dealer with familiar spirits a sworn slave to the devil and his mussulmen would have been hard put to it to write a good defense of him  when our savior was brought before pilate to be arraigned tried and condemned pilate put this question to the jews saying what evil has jesus done if both or either of the stories above had been literally true of jesus there had been no need of false witnesses against him the merchants of the temple were at hand who could have sworn that he was the author of an uproar and riot the like was never seen on their market day that they were great sufferers and losers in their trades and whether he or his party had stolen any of their goods or not yet some were embezzled and others damaged and all through the outrageous violence of this unruly fellow against law and authority if such evidence as this was not enough to convict him of a capital crime then the swineherds of the gadarenes might have deposed how they believed him to be a wizard and had lost two thousand swine through his falcinations that he bid the devils to go into our cattle is not to be denied and if he cured one or two of our countrymen of a violent possession yet in as much as he did us this injury in our swine we justly suspect him of diabolical practices upon both  upon such evidence as this pilate asks the opinion of jews saying what think you if they all had condemned him to be guilty of death it is no wonder since there is not a jury in england would have acquitted any one arraigned and accused in the like case  it is well for our litteral doctors that such accusations were not brought against jesus or their heads would have been sadly puzzled to vindicate his innocence and to prove the injustice and undeservedness of his death and sufferings but for this reason if no other that no such crimes were laid to his charge i believe little or nothing of either of the seemingly miraculous storys before us but look upon them both as prophetical and parabolical narratives of what would mysteriously and more wonderfully and consistently with the wisdom and goodness of jesus be done by him and so i pass to a    third miracle of jesus and that is his transfiguration matt c xvii mark c ix luke c ix on the mount and this is the darkest and blindest story of the whole gospel which a man can make neither head nor foot of and i question whether the conceptions of any two thinking doctors do agree about it to say there is nothing in the letter of this story we believers must not because st peter ii peter cap i v          says he was an eyewitness of jesuss majesty saw his glory on the mount and heard the voice out of the cloud but as infidels will be prying into the conduct of jesuss life and forming their exceptions to the credibility or probability of this or that part of it so we christians should be ready at an answer that might reasonably satisfy them and not forcibly bear down their opposition which will make no sincere converts of them and i believe they would easily distress us with difficultys and objections to the letter of this story  st augustine himself possunt infideles istam vocem delatam de caelo per conjecturas humanas et illicitas curiositates ad magicas arts refer in sermon xliii sect   owns that the whole of it might be performed by magic art and we know in these our days that some jugglers are strange artists at the imitation of a voice and to make it as if it came from a far of when it is uttered close by us and can cast themselves too into different forms and shapes without a miracle to the surprise and admiration of spectators  but what i trow do our divines mean by jesuss transfiguration we read that his countenance did shine like the sun and his raiment was made as white as snow and that is all and is this enough can we think to demonstrate that transaction a miraclous transfiguration philosophers will tell us that the reflections of the light of the sun will change the appearance of colors and to none more than whiteness and skeptics will say that its no wonder if the countenance of jesus looked rubicund when the sun might shine on it  the word in the original for transfigured is  that is he was metamorphosed transformed or if you will transfigured and what is to be understood by a metamorphosis we are to learn not only from the natural import of the word but from the ancient use of it accordingly it signifies nothing less than the change or transformation of a person into the forms shapes and essences of creatures and things of a quite different species size and figure but jesus it is conceived was not so transfigured our divines i suppose would not have him thought such a posturemaster for the whole world if i or any one else should assert that jesus upon the mount transformed himself into a calf a lion a bear a ram a goat an hydra a stone a tree and into many other things of the animate and inanimate world i dare say there would among our orthodox divines be such exclamations against me for blasphemy as the like were never heard of they to be sure will not hear of such a transfiguration nor like good plain believers will bear any thing more than that jesuss countenance did shine like the sun and the color of his countenance was changed which whether it comes up to the import of a metamorphosis or not they dont care  but to close with our divines and acknowledge that the glorious change of jesuss countenance and of the color of his vestments was a true and proper transsiguration and that it was as real and wonderful a miracle as could be wrought but then we may i hope ask them what was the particular reason and use of this miracle was it a miracle only for the sake of a miracle that is an absurdity in the opinion of neque enim miracula propter miracula faci sed  illa quae faciebat miraessent videntibus vera essent intelligentibus in sermon xcviii sect   st augustine who says what is reasonable to think that all and every one of jesuss miracles had its particular end and use or he who is the wisdom as well as power of god had never wrought it and what i pray was the use of this miracle of that the evangelical history is silent and our divines with all their reasoning facultys can say nothing to it  and what did moses and elias on the mount with jesus was it in their own proper persons that they appeared or were they only some specters and apparitions in resemblance of them it is said that they were talking with jesus what then did they talk about the three greatest prophets and philosophers of the universe could not possibly meet and confer together but on the most sublime useful and edifying subject it is strange that the apostles who overheard their confabulation did not make a report of it and transmit it to posterity for our edification and instruction st luke as our english translation has it seems to say that they talked together of jesuss decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem but this cannot be the meaning of st lukes  c ix v   words which so interpreted are no less than a barbarism and i appeal to our greek critics an improper expression of such signification we must then look for a more proper construction of the phrase in st luke or we must remain in the dark as to the subject that moses and elias talked with jesus about  but further why could not this miracle have been wrought in the valley as well as upon a mountain whither jesus and his three apostles ascended for the work of it naughty infidels will say it was for the advantage of a cloud which often moves and rests on the tops of mountains to display his pranks in and why was it not done in the presence of the multitude as well as of his three apustles the more witnesses of a miracle the better it is attested and the more reasonably credited and there could not surely be too many witnesses of this any more than of others of jesuss miracles if real ones ought not the unbelieving multitude for many unbelievers unquestionably were amongst them to have had a sight and hearing of this miracle as well as the apostles who should rather see the miracle than those who wanted conviction were they to take the report of the miracle upon the word of the apostles who were partys in the cause our divines may possibly say they ought but infidels and free thinkers would cry out against them for juggling tricks and pious impostures  these are all difficultys and hard questions about the miracle of christs transfiguration which our clergy who are admirers of the letter of that story are obliged to account for and i believe it will be long enough before they give a proper and satisfactory answer to many of them  let us hear then what the fathers say to this miraculous story of jesuss transfiguration and it is agreed amongst them that the whole is but a type regni coelestis honor praefiguratur st hilar in loc matt in transfiguratione futura regni praemeditatio and gloria demonstrata est st hierom in loc matt prefiguration and  anaft in transfig dom  st chrysist in loc matt aenigmatical resemblance of a future and more glorious and real transfiguration and whenever they speak of any part of the story they never explain to us how the matter went upon mount tabor but tell us of what this or that part of it is figurative and emblematical and how it is to be understood and will be fulfilled in future time as thus by the sex millium scilicet annorum temporibus evolutis st hilar in loc matt sic post sex aetates dominus a perfectis famulis conspicietur dionys alex apud damascen in orat de transfig six days they underandstand six ages of the world after which a real and mysterious transfiguration will be exhibited to our intellectual views by moses and elias et moses and elias apparuerunt in gloria cum jesu colloquentes in quo ostenditur legem and prophetas cum evangeliis consonare and in eadem gloria spiritualis intelligentiae refulgere origin in epist ad romans c   talking with jesus they mean the law and the prophets upon an allegorical interpretation bearing testimony unto christ as the fulfiller of them by the montem ascendit ut te doceat ne quaeras eum nisi in legem and prophetarum montibus origin in cantic cantic hom   mountain on which this future transfiguration will be exhibited they understand the sublime and anagogical sense of the law and the prophets by his transfiguration it self they mean his taking upon him and passing through the forms of all the types of him under the law as of a lamb a lion a serpent a calf a rock a stone and of many others which he is to fulfill and which will then be clearly discerned by us by the black cloud per nubem tetram intellige opacitatem legis damascen in orat de transfigur that at present obstructs this vision they understand the letter of the old testament by the white vestimenta candida jesu sunt sermones and scripta evangeliorum origin in loc matt vestments of jesus they mean the words of the scriptures which will then shine clear and bright by the voice out of the cloud they mean with st peter the word of prophecy that will sound in the ears of our apprehensions and lastly they tell us that the way to attain to the sight of this glorious vision is by ascending not by local motion but by reason to the tops of the mountain of the mysterious and sublime sense of the law and the prophets if we continue in the plains and valley si quis litteram sequitur and deorsum est totus hic non potest videre jesum in vest candida qui autem sequitur sermonem dei and ad montana id est excelsa legis conscendit isti jesus commutatur  quamdiu litteram sequimur occidentem moses and elias cum jesu non loquuntur sin spiritualiter intelligimus statim moses and elias veniunt id est lex and prophetae and colloquuntur cum evangelie johan hieros hom    of the letter like the multitude under the mountain we shall never see jesus in his shining vestments nor how he was transformed into the types of the law nor moses and elias talking with him not the law and the prophets agreeing harmoniously in a testimony to him  after this fashion do the fathers one or other of them copiously treat on every part of this transfiguration of jesus i could collect an almost infinite number of passages out of their writings to this purpose but from these few it is plain they looked on the story of christs transfiguration but as a figure and parable and they were certainly in the right on it in as much as this their sense of the matter and no other will solve the difficultys before started against the letter as any one may discern if he attentively review and compare one with the other as for instance this their sense and interpretation lets us into the reason of moses and eliass appearing on the mount with jesus and gives us to understand what they talked about and that was not on jesuss decease which he would accomplish at jerusalem as our translation has it but on the prophecy of the old testament particularly as st luke says on moses book of exodus and how he would fulfill it at the new jerusalem  whether any besides my self does really apprehended and is willing to understand this story of christs transfiguration as i do i neither know nor care i am not bound to find others ears eyes and capacitys what i have said is enough to show the sense of the fathers about this matter if any dislike their concurrent opinions of jesuss transfiguratons being an emblem an enigma and figurative representation of a future and most glorious transfiguration such a one as they speak of let him account for the difficultys and objections which i have before raised against the letter of this story in the mean time i shall think it literally an absurd improbable and incredible one and no other than a prophetical and parabolical narrative of what will be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by jesus  and thus i have considered three of the miracles of our savior and shown how they are absurdities according to the letter consequently do make nothing for his authority and messiahship i can and will do as much by his other miracles for i would not have any one think i am gotten to the end of my tedder but for some reasons best known to my self i publish these remarks on these three first after the clergy have chewed upon these a while i will take into examination some others of jesuss miracles which for their litteral story are admired by them as for instance i will take to task his miracle john cap ii of changing water into wine at a marriage in cana of galilee which was the beginning of jesuss miracles and should by right have been first spoken to but i am almost too grave to handle the letter of this story as i ought and if i had treated it as ludicrously as it deserves i dont know but at setting out i should have put the clergy quite out of all temper i would not now for the world be so impious and profane as to believe with out divines what is contained and implied in the letter of this story if apollonius tyanaeus and not jesus had been the author of this miracle we should often have reproached his memory with it it is said of apollonius tyanaeus that a table was all on a sudden at his command miraculously spread with variety of nice dishes for the entertainment of himself and his guests which miracle our divines can tell him makes not at all to his credit in as much as it was done for the service and pleasure of luxurious appetites but if apollonius had done as our jesus did at this wedding they would have said much worse of him and that modestly speaking he delighted to make his friends thoroughly merry or he would not be at the pains of a miracle to turn so much water into wine after they had before well drank if the fathers then dont help us out at the mystical and true meaning of this miracle such farther objections may be formed against the letter as may make our divines ashamed of it  i will also take into examination jesuss miracles matt c xiv and xv etc of feeding many thousands in the wilderness with a few loaves and fishes which according to the letter are most tomantick tales i dont in the least question jesuss power to magnify or multiply the loaves and if he pleased to meliorate the bread but that many thousands of men women and children should follow him into the wilderness and stay with him three days and nights too without eating is a little against sense and reason whether the wilderness was near to or far from the peoples habitations the difficultys attending the story are equally great i wonder how jesus amused them all the while that they had the patience to stay with him without food but i much more wonder that no victualers besides the lad with his loaves and fishes of whom and his occupation whether it was that of a baker or fishmonger and of his neglect of his masters business here and of the reason that he met with no hungry chapmen for his bread before we shall make some enquiry but particurly why he alone i say and no other victualers no other retalers of cakes and gingerbread followed the camp in short for all the imaginary greatness of the miracle which there is a way to reduce and lessen of jesuss feeding his thousands with a few loaves there must be some fascination or enchantment condemned by the laws of the jews as well as of other nations in the matter or the people if they had stayed one day would not two much less three to faint but would especially the women and children have been for returning the first night home we must then seek to the fathers who say the five books of moses are the five barley loaves etc and the septiformd spirit the seven loaves etc for a good notion of this miracle and if they dont make it a parable do what our divines can it will turn to the dishonor of the holy jesus  i will also consider the miracle of jesuss mark cap ii luke c v curing the man sick of the palsy for whom the roof of the house was broken up to let him down into the room where jesus was because his bearers could not enter in at the door for the press of the people this literally is such a rodomontado that were men to stretch for a wager against reason and truth none could outdoe it where was the humanity of the people and wherefore did they so tumultuate against the door of the house it is strange they had not so much compassion on the paralytick as to give way to him it is more strange that his bearers could get to the top of the house with him and his bed too when they could not get to the door nor the sides of it it is yet stranger that the good man of the house would suffer his house to be broken up when it could not be long ere the tumult of the people would be appeased but most strange that jesus who could drive his thousands out of the temple before him and draw as many after him into the wilderness did not by force or persuasion make the people to retreat but that such needless trouble and pains must be taken for the miraculous cure of this poor man let us think of these things against the time that out of the fathers i prove this story to be a parable  i will also take into consideration the miracle of jesuss curing the john cap ix blind man for whom eye salve was made of clay and spittle which eye salve whether it was balsamic or not does equally affect the credit of the miracle if it was naturally medicinal there is an end of the miracle and if it was not at all medicinal it was foolishly and impertinently applied and can be no otherwise accounted for than by considering it with the fathers as a figurative act in jesus  i will also take into consideration the several stories of jesuss raising of the dead and without questioning his actual bringing of the dead to life again will prove from the circumstances of those storys that they are parabotical and are not literally to be applied to the proof of jesus s divine authority and messiahship or for instance jesus when he raised jariuss mark cap v daughter from the dead would never have turned the people out of the house who should have been his best and properest witnesses  i will also consider the miracle of jesus s matt cap xxi mark cap xi cursing the fig tree for its not bearing fruit out of season which upon the bare mention of it appears to be a foolish absurd and ridiculous act if not figurative  i will also consider the matt cap ii journey of the wisemen out of the east with their literally senseless and ridiculous presents of frankincence and myrrh to a newborn babe if with their gold which could be but little they had brought their dozens of sugar soap and candles which would have been of use to the child and his poor mother in the straw they had acted like wise as well as good men but what i pray was the meaning and reason of a star like a will a whisp for their guide to the place where the holy infant lay could not god by divine impulse in a vision or in a dream as he ordered their return home have sent them on this important errand but that a star must be taken or made out of course to this purpose i wonder what communication passed between these wise men and the star or how they came to know one anothers use and intention but the fathers shall speak hereafter farther to the senselesness of this story literally and make out the mystery and true meaning of it  i will also by the leave of our divines take again into consideration the miraculous conception of the virgin mary and the resurrection of jesus from the dead i do believe if it may so please our divines that jesus was born of a pure virgin and that he arose from the dead but speaking too briefly in the moderator to these two miracles they took offense i will therefore give them a review and speak home to them particularly to christs resurrection the evangelical story of which literally is such a complication of absurditys incoherences and contradictions that unless the fathers can help us to a better understanding of the evangelists than we have at present we must of necessity give up the belief of it  these and many alia quam plurima his similia in evangeliis inveniet quicunque attentius legerit origin de principiis l iv other of the historical and miraculous parts of jesuss life will i take into examination and show that none of them literally do prove his divine authority so far from it that they are full of absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities but that his whole life in the flesh is but quae enarratio erit evangelii sensibilis nisi accommodetur ad intelligibile and spirituale nulla sane origin in praefat ad johan evang type figure and parable of his mysterious and spiritual life and operations in mankind  in the end of this head it will be a curious and diverting subject to examine the miracles of jesus as they are literally understood by the notions which our divines have advanced about miracles and to show that even their notions compared with christs miracles are destructive of his authority and subversive of christianity this i say would be a most diverting undertaking and it will be strange if some freethinker that loves pleasure of this kind does not take the hint and snatch the work out of my hands if i do it ray self i shall have especial regard to the writers against the grounds without passing by mr chandlers essay on miracles on which the more remarks will be made if it be but to pay my respects to the arch bishops judgment and to show my admiration at those extravagant praises which his grace at lambeth has bestowed on that author among other his notable notions of a miracle and the archbishop says he has see archbishop wakes manuscript letter to mr chandler which is handed about town and country set the notion of a miracle upon a clear and sure foundation one is chandler s vindication etc page    that miracles should be things probable as well us possible that they do not carry along with them the appearance of romance and fable which would unavoidably prejudice men against believing them this is certainly a good and right notion of a divine miracle and i dont doubt but according to it mr chandler and the archbishop think they can justify the litteral story of our saviors miracles against the charge of fable and romance but whether they are able to do it or not i shall go on in some discourses hereafter to be published to prove that our divines by espousing the letter of christs miracles have deceived themselves into the belief of the most arrant quixotism that can be devised and palmd upon the understandings of mankind i say they have deceived themselves for neither the fathers nor the apostles nor even jesus himself meant that his miracles as recorded in the evangelists should be taken in a litteral sense but in dominus noster ea quae faciebat corporaliter etiam spiritualiter volebat intelligi etc august sermon xcviii sect   a mystical figurative and parabolical one and this should bring me to the  iii head of my discourse that is to consider what jesus means when he appeals to his works and miracles as to a witness and testimony of his divine authority and to show that he could not properly and truly refer to those supposed to be wrought by him in the flesh but to those mystical ones he would do in the spirit of which those seemingly wrought by him in the flesh are but types and shadows  but this head cannot be rightly spoken to till i have more amply discussed the former which by gods leave i promise to do and if my courteous readers will be so kind as to trust me till that time i assure them to prove that no ignorance and stupidity can be greater than the imagination that jesus really appealed to his miracles supposed to have been wrought by him in the flesh as to a witness and testimony of his divine authority and messiahship  in the mean time our divines may go on in their own way if they think fit and admire jesus of old and celebrate his power and praises for healing of bodily diseases and doing other notable feats according to the letter of the evangelical story but i am for the spirirual jesus and messiah who cures the worse quos in corporibus morbos sanavit christus hi in animabus existunt and supernam ejus opem requirunt johan nepot hieros hom lxi distempers of the soul and does other mysterious and most miraculous works of which those recorded in the evangelists are but figure and parable this is the primitive and concurrent opinion about the true messiah which the fathers universally adhered to whether our jesus at this day be such a spiritual messiah to his church or whether she does not stand in need of such a one is the question that our divines are to see to but i will add here what i believe and shall have another opportunity to prove that god on purpose suffered or empowered false as well as true prophets bad as well us good men such as apollonius vespasian and many others to cure diseases and to do other mighty works equal to what are literally reported of jesus not only to defeat us of all distinction between true and false miracles which are the object of our bodily senses but to raise and keep up our thoughts to the constant contemplation of jesuss spiritual mysterious and most miraculous works which are the object of our understandings and loudly bespeak the power wisdom and goodness of god and which are to be the absolute demonstration of jesuss divine authority and messiahship to the conversion of jews and infidels  i have no more to do at present but like a moderator to conclude with a short address and exhortation to infidels and apostates the two contending partys in the present controversy and  first to apostates i mean the writers against the grounds and scheme whether you grave sirs who account your selves orthodox divines though there is little but contradiction and inconsistency amongst you do like the name of apostates which is given you i much question but it is the properest i could think of for your desertion of primitive doctrine about prophecy and miracles i could not improperly have given you a worse title but i was willing to compliment you rather than reproach you wish this  but setting aside the title of apostates whether it be in your opinion opprobious or not you may plainly perceive that i am sirs on your side as to the truth of christianity and if you will accept of my assistance for the proof of jesuss messiahship from prophecy upon the terms of the allegorical scheme proposed in my moderator you shall find me your hearty abettor upon the allegorical scheme i dont doubt but we shall soundly drub and maul infidels and beat them out of the field of battle if you being wedded to the litteral scheme will not accept of my assistance you may go on in your own way and see the event of the controversy which in the end will turn to your dishonor  you sirs cannot but be sensible how those two great generals mr grounds and mr scheme with their potent armies of reasons and authorities against your litteral prophecies have greivously distressed and galled you and if you dont make an honorable retreat in time and seek to allegorists for help will gain a complete victory and triumph over you  instead of the help of allegorists you i find under the disappointment of your litteral scheme choose rather to have recourse to jesuss miracles but what little dependence there is upon his miracles in your sense i have in part proved in this discourse and this i have done give me leave repeatedly to declare it not for the service of your unbelieving adversaries but to reduce you to the good old way of interpreting oracles which upon the testimony of the fathers will one day be the conversion of the jews and gentiles  whether you sirs will be pleased with this short discourse on christs miracles i much question but before you put your selves into a rage against it i beg of you to read st theophilus of antioch origin st hilary st augustine st ambrose st jerome st chrysostom st john of jerusalem st theophylact and other occasional ancient pieces on one part or other of the evangelists and you will find how they countenance such a discourse as this on miracles and will abundantly assist me in the prosecution of it  i expect sirs that some of you will be ready to rave against me for this discourse but this is my comfort that if your passion should arise to another prosecution of me you cannot possibly separate any of mine from the opinions of the fathers to ground a prosecution on and what dishonor in the end will redown to protestant and pretendedly learned divines of the church of england to persecute again the fathers for primitive doctrine i desire you to think on  but as i suppose you will have more wit sirs than to prosecute me again for this discourse so i hope you will have more ingenuity than odiously after your wonted manner to represent me to the populace for profaneness blasphemy and infedelity if you dislike the whole or any part of this discourse appear like men and scholars from the press against it use me as roughly in print as you think fit i will not take it ill  veniam petimus dabimusque vicissim i desire nothing more than to be furiously attacked from the press which if i am not much mistaken would give me a longed for opportunity to expose your ignorance to more advantage  be not longer mistaken good sirs the history of jesuss life as recorded in the evangelists is an emblematical representation of his spiritual life in the soul of man and his miracles are figures of his mysterious operations the four gospels are in no part a litteral story but a system of mystical philosophy or theology  if you are resolved not to come into this opinion i beg of you again before you break forth into a passion to try to viudicate the litteral story of the three miracles spoken to in this discourse viz those of jesuss driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple of his exorcising the devil out of the madman and of his transfiguration on the mount which if you are able to defend against the fathers and my objections i will give up the cause to you and own my self what i am sarr enough from being an impious insidel and blasphemer and deserving of the worst punishment in the mean time i make bold again to assert that the litteral story of christ life and miracles is an absurd and incredible romance full of contradictions and inconsistencys and that modern paraphrases are not only a consequential reflection on the intellects of the evangelists and their divine gifts of the spirit as if they could not write an intelligible and coherent piece of biography without your help at this distance of time but have are like an highmettald blind horse that were they not ridden by the civil authority with a strait rein would be oppressing and trampling upon all that stood in the way of their interests to the disturbance of civil society  profaneness to does the bishop charge me with but why so because i ridicule the nonsense and absurditys of jesuss miracles according to the letter which he venerates very fine indeed the bishop would worship the head of an ass and a wiser man than himself without the charge of profaneness must not laugh at his foolish superstition  and blasphemy lastly does the bishop accuse me of and this is a sad bugbear word that has frighted abundance of people into dreadful apprehensions of my guilt even to the abhorrence of me but the bishop should first have defined what is meant by blasphemy and have proved one guilty of it before he made his exclamations or the turks may say that a jest upon their alcoran in which there are no contradictions is as much a blasphemy as any ludicrousness upon the gospels which are full of inconsistencies that there is such a sin or error called blasphemy according to the scriptures is certain but our divines are undetermined about the nature of it i intend to take my opportunity to treat on the sin of blasphemy and to prove ministers of the letter are the only persons that can be guilty of it ministers of the letter upon the authority of the fathers are the worshippers of the apocalyptical beast and antiallegorical expositions are that blasphemy st john writes of which the beast and his worshippers will open their mouths in against the most high this shall be proved as clear as the light but when i do it i would not have any think it is with an intention to bring the bishops of london litchfield and st davids or any other divines under prosecution for that heinous sin no my god is omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent and knows how and when to reckon with such blasphemers without calling upon the civil magistrate to do it for him should i importune the civil authority to execute vengeance upon them i should make a foolish calf or a senseless idol of my god that was unable or knew not how nor when to vindicate his own cause surely the bisho of london upon his prosecution of  for blasphemy must think his god  asleep or gone a journey from home  he would not be for taking gods  work out of his hands and committing it to the care of the civil magistrate  the bishop moreover should consider that the words profane and blasphemous are of no use and significaiton among philosophers who in disputation never cast them at each other however they may differ in opinion philosophers are all supposed to be such profound venerators of the deity as they would not be guilty of profaneness and blasphemy for the whole world if any of our school of freethinkers should say of his opponent that he is profane and blasphemous he would be reprimanded for want of wit temper and good manners and be told that he is like a billing sgate scold who had recourse to impertinent bad language when her reason fails her for better rhetoric  but it may be for ought i know the bishop has some design in his accusations against me for profaneness and blasphemy but i hope it is a better than to prejudice the civil magistrate or to incense the populace  according to the fathers i am so far from being a blasphemer that they say christ upon the litteral interpretation of his miracles is metamorphosed into the falsechrist called antichrist whether there is any truth in this their opinion i cannot be positive till the experiment is fully made but if our clergy will keep their temper and grant me a clear stage of battle i will try it out and see whether i i cannot by the club of reason and primitive authority give their antichrist a fatal blow who knows but i may give peace to the church and reconcile all partys by it  however this may be i am sure no man can wish for a greater advantage over his enemy than i have over the bishop in this controversy but he shall find me a generous adversary who will make no worse use of my advantage over him than now and then to put him in mind of his pastoral letter and of the prosecution unless i should be tempted ere long to publish my moderatorial letter like his pastoral one to the people of london and westminster with ten wholesome rules in it not only to caution them against false prophets and false teachers without forgetting the bishop of the diocese but to direct them to the ecclesiastical fountain of the growing sins errors and infidelity of the age which the clergy know i am of ability to lay open  when i began the publication of these discourses i own i laid a trap for some considerable clergyman but little imagined the great bishop of london would be caught in it but now i have taken hold of him i will not release him out of the controversy till he has sorely repented of his ignorance or malice in calling me a writer in favor of infidelity  so much at present for the bishop of london i have been the quicker of late in the printing of this because i am given to understand the bishop of st davids stays for it intending to make but one work of it and answer all six discourses together i hope my rabbis letter here will be thought by him a good payment for his patience and now i shall be in expectation of his mountainous production and where i shall hide myself from the terrible strokes of his pen i have not as yet considered  i am not a little pleased to see a couple of dissenting preachers viz dr harris and mr atkinson listed into the controversy against me if they had kept their necks out of the collar they might have dissembled and pretended that upon the conclusion of the battle when it would have appeared i am a real contender for primitive christianity they had a better understanding of the fathers and a clearer view of my design than to suspect me of blasphemy and infidelity but now they are engaged with equal spite ignorance and defamations against me they must take their share of the fate and shame with the clergy upon the conclusion of the controversy  there is no body can think it worth my while to bestow a sixpenny pamphlet upon either of these gentlemen but for all that they shall not be altogether slighted and neglected by me i have made a collection of their rhetorical flowers which occasionally shall be presented to the public to the admiration of their wit reason learning and eloquence and at present only take notice that they are both for the persecution of me but not so much for my opinions as the indecency irreverence and immorality of my style forfooth which is such a distinction as may be easily stretched to the justification of the persecution of all authors whom the priesthood in power shall not like mr atkinsons argument for the presecution of me is much the same with that which john calvin used for the persecution of that great philosopher servetus the injustice and cruelty of whose death and sufferings is a greater reproach to the name of calvin than the martyrdom of any protestant can be to the memory of any popish prelate  to conclude what i have written in these six discourses is with a view to the glory of god the advancement of truth the happiness of mankind the demolition of babylon the edification of jerusalem and the demonstration of the messiahship of our
