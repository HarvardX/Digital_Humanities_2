for the time being  00 poems ludicrous satirical and moral to a gentleman who censured the author for scribbling verses written in the year mdcclxv you ask me why i spend my time in fruitless ribaldry and rhyme on critics poets players the ministers of state you say would gladly take me into pay and none so good as theirs i thank ye  but i have had to do with ministers as well as you and know they are wondrous civil they will promise places for your pains but care not when they have sucked your brains if you were at the devil did war or rude rebellion shake the court and make the city quake i then my pen might draw not in these piping times of peace when wealth with taxes must increase and freedoms fixed by law i once indeed did such a thing to serve my country and my king and of my own accord a king who had the grace and spirit to know his friends and loyal merit could liberally reward but since for truth may dare be just false policy has given disgust while natures powerful charms wooed me those hidden paths texplore which lock and newton trod before and won me to her arms not but relaxing now and then philosophy lays down the pen when pictures poems plays even musicks prostituted art engage the eye the ear the heart amusing various ways meanwhile an hour i would rather sit to look at pritchard from the pit than kiss the papal toe nay rather than a monarchs hand for garrick there would even stand till i could hardly go while thus amused and thus employed life wears away not unenjoyd though free from ill intention good providence but give me health i envy no mans wit or wealth nor pine for place or pension let others write to please the rabble in hopes some ministerial squabble may pluck the fools a feather believe me i am no such fool like  to be made the tool of knaves and fools together fine sights or the countess of c  y in elysium written in the year mdcclx on the banks of the styx as a beautiful ghost in resemblance the shade of the goddess of love was revolving the days when a countess and toast she flaunted about in the regions above news arrived which soon made all elysium to ring that the fates a great monarch had summoned to rest in calling old englands late father and king to a crown of reward in the realms of the blessed my lady was vexed to be robbed of the occasion by dying before him so malapropos of seeing his royal young heirs coronation and making a party herself in the show she therefore in haste skipt away to the ferry  here charon youre empty come take over me i am resolved to go back to the world in your wherry the only fine sight i ever missed of to see old charon most civilly bowed to my lady stepped out of his wherry and handed her in but finding she wanted a pass was as ready her ladyship roughly to turn out again then skudding away to the court in a hurry direct for a passport to pluto she ran and put madam proserpine into a flurry who thought she was come to seduce her good man gloomy dis grimly smiled at the ladys request but more at her whimsical motive and reason and having malignly a mind for a jest represented her suit as a thing out of season i cannot said he lady fair with a frown indulge every ghost in it is wanton desire but if for their sakes wife or husband come down i then might restore the fond souls they require since orpheus however in risk of his life long ago made us stare with his music and passion not a soul has come down or for husband or wife so that journies of this kind are quite out of fashion yet as youre a beauty the favor i grant ye but wherefore again should you covet on earth to mix with a crowd that perhaps only want ye to make you the theme of impertinent mirth besides pretty lady youre greatly mistaken if pleasure you promise yourself in the sight for unseen by your friends by admirers forsaken there is none will regard an impalpable spright nay nay quoth the countess if that be the case take your passport again i will have no more chagrin a fig for fine sights if unseen ones fine face what signifies seeing if one is not seen an epistle to mr garrick on the report of his having left the stage written in the year mdcclxv so mr garrick is it true as folks report the stage and you took a french leave at parting we hoped the italian air and diet had quite restored your health and quiet and made you keen for starting in vain we listened to the tales brought over by the foreign mails that you were home returning to see your name in capitals stuck up on tavernposts and walls with fond impatience burning your wished arrival vain to boast if never entered at the post you shun the race of glory as well you might have traveled on from pope to turk to prester john the world was all before ye for to be plain sir enter nous twas not about your wife or you we all were so solicitous you might as well be there as here if as king richard bays or lear you mean no more to visit us your friends if friends they are indeed your spirit or your spleen may plead from acting to excuse ye but spite of what your friends declare we your admirers cannot bear to get you thus to lose ye it is true they make a mighty stir about you as a manager intent on reformation busy instructing in their parts in claptrap attitudes and starts the rising generation but ah in vain removed from sight the candles to improve the light though pleased the pit immensely if all your pupils need the rod as much as fiddlefaddle  or blustering bouncing  to those who never have garrick seen such acting may not give the spleen to me it is the devil to sit three hours my noddle bare to see your  rant and tear and hear that  snivel i often as i come to town in order to spare you a crown dine gratis with my printer but damn it if i am doomed to see such mummers play instead of thee i will come no more this winter on the investigation of truth an epistle to lorenzo too long have childish bards too long their hours employed in idle song busied the lineaments to trace of withered fictions painted face where not a native beauty blows but cankers eat the budding rose yet captive to her smiles and wit pleased with their chains her slaves have writ and all the labored pomp of verse employed her fables to rehearse while thou o sacred truth remain the theme of every humbler strain and yet believe what each pretends and numerous are her rhyming friends while such her fond admirers prove and tune their rival songs to love but fools in fondness as in awe the truth it is plain they never saw and but themselves her lovers boast because her name the public toast still playing a fictitious part no real passion at the heart for say what lovers passions true for beauty that he never knew so eastern monarchs love their wives though barren strangers all their lives so loved la manchas famous knight the fair for whom he swore to fight fired by the enthusiastic rage with men and monsters to engage yet asked for whom this martial strife he never saw her in her life nor was he positive god wot whether indeed she lived or not thus bards too often in truths defense break through the rules of common sense and over his rival each to aspire strives which shall prove the greatest liar strange to the liberty of thought vile slaves but seeking to be bought to lying faction early trained a purchase by the truth disdained meantime as insolent as vain they freedoms sacred name profane and boasting hug the chains that bind that worst of slaves the servile mind such dryden thou immortal bard whose genius claims supreme regard how honored might not truth accuse thy venal prostituted muse say thou it is strange the world should rest content by falsehood thus depressed alas thou little know mankind who seeing imitate the blind in spite of truth and open day in darkness choose to grope their way suspecting plainness of disguise the obvious sense of terms despise from sound or derivation gleaning some farfetched dark and doubtful meaning while each impostors word prevails in mystic parables and tales neglected even the word divine if with it sense and reason join look back through each successive age how honored the mysterious page what millions have been the tools of knaves whose natural prey is fools how strangely tricked deluded crowds who truth expecting from the clouds and therefore gaping into the air on error stumbled unaware thus an astrologer of old in learned history we are told contemplating the milky way neglected that before him lay and led by wandering planets fell unluckily into a well yet ever with slander branding those who seek the naked truth to expose shortsighted mortals in their pride thus strive their ignorance to hide by holding all beyond their view beyond investigation too lorenzo our misfortune here the effect of idleness and fear the sluggard shuns inquirys task because too great the pains to ask stifling the emotions of his breast to indulge his lazy brains in rest a paradox yet such the fact more fear to think than fear to act in thought though danger we surmize in act while real danger lies in truth my friend it is sad to find hence rise the zeal of half mankind religion but the compound vice of indolence and cowardice even pious christians much i fear are practically atheists here how deaf and blind to calls of grace when nature wears a smiling face but when she frowns in wild amaze look how the affrighted cowards gaze when clouds drop fatness on the plains in mildlysoft descending rains in their due season harvests smile and plenty crowns the peasants toil as nothing rare as nothing new we take the blessing as our due for o prosperitys a lot at ease enjoyed with ease forgot in junes warm sun and aprils shower we trace not an almighty power ingrates so light of heaven we make nor think the hand that gives may take but ah when threatening storms arise when thunders rattle through the skies when the tall mountain bows its head and earthquakes vomit up the dead behold whole nations prostrate fall before the mighty god of all to appease his anger now their care lo all is fasting sighs and prayer till the dread storm blown happily over they rise and revel as before forget or ridicule the rod and laugh to scorn the fear of god nor only moved when dangers nigh our fears awake the general cry imaginary scenes alike the dastard soul with terror strike while to the cowards optics seem light straws as each a giants beam in honor thus of god above so weakly draw the cords of love while natures groans or fancys fears drive headlong down the vale of tears lorenzo would thou freely trace whence grows a cowardice so base at the early dawn of moral sense the infatuation did commence and propagated since by art we all have more or less a part ere hermit bald or pilgrim gray had worn the solitary way ere yet the monk had told his beads ere yet credulity or creeds to school with sober reason sent young genius to experience went the latter though as yet it is true no wiser than the former two in charge the tender pupils took and with them read in natures book so pedagogues unlettered use no class of blockheads to refuse but gravely undertake to explain the arts themselves must first attain sufficient if the master goes before his blundering pupils nose careful his vacant hours to employ now reason proved a hopeful boy but genius insolent and wild by nature an assuming child a treacherous memory his lot the little that he learned forgot nor gave himself a moments pain to con his lessons over again but trusting to his forward parts debauched with wit the sisterarts who yet unsettled young and frail enamored listened to his tale and since the cause of dire disputes turned out abandoned prostitutes by priest and prophet once enjoyed to basest purposes employed for ages past their only use to vitiate reason or traduce for this tradition foremost came instruction was her maiden name now grown a smoothtongud slippery jade an arrant mistress of her trade she told the stories over and over that genius told the arts before repeating lies as liars do till in the end they think them true and when detected in her lie  mystery  the biters arch reply by this fine dame our mothers taught their scheme of education wrought so trained us early to deceit to look on reason as a cheat to lies first tuned the opening ear awoke our earliest sense to fear with monsters and chimeras vain filled the soft head and turned the brain till the fond fools to top their part fixed the rank coward at the heart nor with our growing years released the nurse but moulds us for the priest who lest his ward grown sly or stout should find the knavish secret out the bugbear from his reach removes and all the old womans tale improves passions more riotous to quell changed the dark hole for darker hell the truant damned for naughty play blackmonday now is the judgmentday in promise hopes for toys are given and endless holidays in heaven the groundless fear and vain desire which hence mankind in youth acquire how deeply rooted do we find how fixed the impressions on the mind the weakness of those childish fears too often increasing with our years while every infant joy and strife improved is carried into life for see the idiot and the wise each from his own fond shadow flies like curs that run till nature fails a bladder fastened to their tails with idle fears the world to abuse assistant here the inventive muse the tale of wonder early taught when playful young and void of thought by stroling fancy led astray the vagrant trould the jovial lay alas of mirth and pleasure cured to horrors brownest shade inured by love of wonder since betrayed to lend fantastic spleen her aid for whom her numbers sad and slow in dismal melancholy flow condemned to murmur all the day to sigh and groan the midnight lay the skull the spade the shroud the hearse the doleful implements of verse or doomed prepostrous tales to tell by brainsick fiction brought from hell for know the unwary muse was caught while fiction yet her friend was thought a hag by ignorance badly nursed with craving appetite accursed to spleens embrace while yet a maid the dire chlorosis had betrayed since when the wretch has roamd abroad her sullen tyrants willing bawd a vile procuress to supply the love of wonder with a lie hence bards that reason less than rail affect to tell the woeful tale or vent their moralizing rage as bugbears of a fearful age to truth pretending to be led by megrims in the sick mans head as if with zeal prophetic burned the wretch whose blisterd head was turned the fittest those the truth to teach by fevers halfdeprivd of speech whose faultring tongues most loud complain when death or doctors shake the brain nor seldom

lies a deity forsook the skies and rambling curious up and down entered at length an afric town where lived a tribe of mortals black with each a hump upon his back a burden common to the nation through each such successive generation the comely god wellshapd and fair marched forward with a graceful air while gathering round the gaping throng wondered and hooted him along this gave a kick and that a thump all crying where is the fellows hump the females too among the rest their detestation loud expressed while luscious jokes were cut and cracked to see a man so slender backed eager each flirt to have a fling at such a pale faced ugly thing nay heaven knows where their taunts had ended if fate the god had not befriended but so it chanced a sober sage advanced revered for sense and age made wise by time and observation his knowledge gleaned from every nation he whites had seen as well as blacks no mountains bearing on their backs and knew from reasons consequential color and form were not essential yet still too wise to call in doubt the wisdom of the rabble rout he thus the stranger to protect addressed the mob with due respect o give my friends your insults of nor vex this hapless creature more what though before our eyes we see a lump of fair deformity not even a molehill on his shoulder to captivate one black beholder but like an unshapd log he stands unfinished left by natures hands yet mock him not in cruel pride for wanting what the gods denied it is affectation makes the fool no object this of ridicule it might have been your fate or mine to want the human hump divine and each of us an ugly sight might have flatshoulderd been and white if therefore heaven to us so kind gives the protuberance behind thanks to the gods with fervor pay but send this wretch unhurt away the mob on every word intent with some few murmurings gave consent when now the sage the god addressed and thus dismissed the injured guest on earth a welcome would thou find go hence and learn to know mankind in other lands thy form and face may challenge comeliness and grace but here to beauty are we blind if wanting of a hump behind thus every nation every tribe peculiar sentiments imbibe and beauty virtue sense lay claim to little more than empty name varied in every clime and nation as suits the general situation hence judging each by different rules they think each other knaves or fools while no defect or vice is known unless it differ from their own to turn the shafts of scorn aside then take this maxim for your guide go where you will be sure to wear the general

wolfdogs from the door how stand you with his grace how comes it such quick parts as yours get not some pretty sinecures a pension or some place why faith good sir to tell you true i wish i were as rich as you but prodigal in grain at school my little weekly cash went all in whips and tops and trash improvident of gain nor growing up did ever i choose for lords to fetch and carry news like spaniels for a crust with bread by labor earned i would rather keep soul and body just together till dust return to dust contented i can sit me down snug in the midst of this vile town as in a village

against the pen or churchill scorning to give out should prove less merciful than stout to an apt tale an equal friend to both requests you to attend three sisters daughters of the town a family of some renown together lived though single lives jangling as husbands and their wives the first like tristram named in haste was christened by misnomer taste a splenetic and formal prude averse to all that is low or rude fainting at every odious jest and starch as any quaker dressed so nice so sinical so quaint no sinner sure so much a saint for this was all a fair outside her vice and vanity to hide the second a fantastic dame as modish in her dress as name a battered strumpet fashion hight the bane of many a living wight a gray coquet whose magic power though wasting with the present hour her charms deciduous but decay to sprout again some future day while thus alternate youth and age by turns her votaries engage and still with constancy maintain her most inconstant tyrant reign the third a female full of zeal still flaming for the commonweal tho as her sister fashion guides alternate taking different sides now a rank tory talking big and now a grumbling steadfast whig or when no business of the nation sets her warm blood in fermentation as keen she flies at lower game a poets or a painters fame alike she raves alike she bounces about pink furbelows and flounces in every cause sincere and hearty her name as well as nature party now ancient maids and barren wives who lead unprofitable lives full often keep the devil rout em a pack of animals about em dogs cats or monkies substitutes for children often less natural brutes thus did our jarring sisters three keep a wellstockd menagerie whither each quadruped and biped by gentle treatment was invited or bird or beast or fair or frightful for the more strange the more delightful accordingly in numbers came domestic foreign wild and tame from stade and norway noble rats from italy fine warbling cats taught by marcel himself to dance a troop of apes skippd over from france from turkey tutored in the east an irish renegado beast that like a bornean ape could swing and trot upon an iron string next from st omers learned college there came a prodigy of knowledge a chien scavant or dog of parts at least a bachelor of arts that knew the greek and latin better than all the academy belleslettres but more than all a dancing bear and favorite pug engaged their care the latter as a dog of merit was cherished for his former spirit for he though now much past his prime had been an odd dog in his time would fetch and carry leap over sticks and play a thousand comic tricks him had our ladies long preferred to be their doughty bodyguard hence in the parlour was he placed and with a silver collar graced on a soft velvet cushion seated and by all three most kindly treated whence growing insolent and proud he growld so fierce and barked so loud that not another dog or cat about the house dared smell a rat or set a foot into the parlour for fear of this eternal snarler who like a greedy envious elf loved no one creature but himself rough bruin but as yet a cub unlickd and yet unweand from bub was boarded with a neighboring vicar and nurtured with his favorite liquor hence growing sturdy and mischievous he often committed outrage grievous made a cats paw of toms the mouser and plagued to death poor harmless touzer drowned old grimalkin and in ire threw playful kittens in the fire for out of wantonness or spite in mischief lay his sole delight though some excuse him and will say that what he did was but in play the maggots of a dancing bear to make the people hoot and stare as if dame nature formed one half the world to make the other laugh at length however most unruly he fell upon his keeper truly and when corrected threw him down and trampled on the parsons gown made even a kennel of the church and left his feeders in the lurch meanwhile as strolling up and down the sport and terror of the town his brother brutes he chanced to see that lodged in the menagerie here the first scene that caught his eye was a broad stage erected high on which a set of mimic apes played monkeytricks in various shapes grinnd chatterd laughed and made such faces that bruin piqud at their grimaces scrambled aloft resolved to rout em and with his bears paws laid about him hugging each monkeydog and bitch as loving satan hugged the witch while the poor devils screamd aloud the jest and pity of the crowd next in a neighboring charnel vault he smokd a pack of hounds at fault by some spayd bitchs nose misled to snuffie there among the dead in search of fannys knocking ghost of whom the scent in earth was lost but bruin never wanted scent after whatever game he went but smelt her out and to be doing fell foul upon a brother bruin pomposo famed as rude a bear as ever was shown in southwark fair illfavored clumsy and uncouth the veriest monster of the booth his waters bruin closely watched when hurt pomposo overmatchd and fairly worsted in the fray growld and turned tail and slunk away flushed with success and fond of fame now bruin ran at higher game nay some though these we dont rely on pretend he dared to attack the lion but brutes as well as men it is known pay a due deference to the throne certain it is he made fine sport of the oergrown jackals of the court and caused the rest to quake for fear around the country far and near these triumphs envious pug had seen and halfdevourd with spite and spleen another quadruped to see more feared and mischievous than he resolved tassail this mighty beast or give himself such airs at least that folks might think he did not fear him so growld whenever he came near him his mistress party hence mistaken till much too late to save his bacon unequal match her favrites ruin slipped poor presumptuous pug at bruin unknowing that though bark he might his toothless gums no more could bite but roughlygentle bruin seized and softly first old puggy squeezed who thinking all the mischief done his foe could do kept barking on when now enraged at hapless pug he gave him such a cursed hug that well nigh all his bones he broke so devilish serious was the joke then threw the limping snarler down to howl and piss about the town such ever is the fate of those who wantonly make folks their foes or quarrelsome provoke the fight with bravoes of superior might and thus even bruins self may catch a tartar who may prove his match and to some future tiger bow as low as pug to him does now on happiness and the incapacity of mankind for its attainment an epistle to lorenzo do wits this maxim still profess that man was born for happiness tho towers of hope he fondly raise their structure lasting all his days in expectation even possessing the better half of every blessing his bliss for ever in his view whenever he pleases to pursue my friend with care such maxims weigh nor run with giddy wits astray genius in search of truth may roam but bliss if found is found at home to region clime nor soil confined this boasted seed of heavenly kind ah vainly boasted if below the plant celestial cannot grow say sophists neither more nor less than happiness is happiness yet will they boast this state unknown this bliss indefinite their own  the difference plain twixt bliss and woe whatever we feel we surely know what state can then be ever thine which sense nor science can define that man by others is it confessed never is but still is to be blessed yet would they teach in moral strain how all may happiness attain as well who never was blessed with light may boast the happiness of sight the splendor of the solar ray or teach his comrades blind their way as such to thee make ever known a state of being never their own do thou to prove my judgment wrong in answer quote thy favorite song true bliss thy pope if we believe all hands can reach all heads conceive see popes essay on man  the happiness of each confined in truth to that of all our kind but terms so general naught define the bliss of all not yours nor mine for yet distinctlys understood the public from the private good nor does it prove this maxim right to say that both in one unite unless their union be so plain that seeking one we both obtain since the individual for himself applies to riot fame or pelf in spite of all the wise can say we seek our bliss a separate way just as the present maggots bite take our own measures for the right or having no peculiar whim along the tide of custom swim meanwhile tho all of bliss dispute none leave their darling substitute how short of happiness is gold the miser cries yet keeps his hold in women sighs the battered rake what solid comfort can we take ah what in wine silenus asks yet cart the whore go stave the casks  how shall the sons of comus live if wine nor women life will give thus public happiness our care but for our own peculiar share while sons their fathers hopes traduce and here even patriotisms abuse however then the specious face of wit may countenance the case bliss inconsistently we call the happiness of one and all nor is it yet precisely meant by good ease pleasure or content good might we variously explain ease is deliverance but from pain pleasure is actual joy confessed and mere content but patient rest a neutral state at best and worst but negatively blessed or cursed that which our happiness we call tho that nor this the sum of all the words plain meanings plainly this some constant state of actual bliss no matter whether in degree alike bestowed on you or me enough if void of fear or pain no motive lead us to complain enough whatever the mode of joy if such that it can never cloy look round the world and tell me true where is such happiness in view from monarchs fled as sings the bard his patrons virtue to reward tell me in truth was st john blessed or did the bitter bard but jest dipping his pen in worse than gall an outed statesman blessed to call with equal truth the muse might paint my lord of bolingbroke a saint run riot over his dubious fame and dub him with a patriots name so worthy of his countrys praise so meek so holy all his ways nor tho to him to him alone a state of perfect bliss unknown of each complexion age degree mankind as far removed as he go ask my friend from door to door the high the low the rich the poor in court or cot if here or there resides the mortal free from care you ask in vain for joy and strife diversify all states of life to wield the scythe with sweaty brow with wearied arm to guide the plough to sow in hope to reap in joy thine labor is the sweet employ a life of rest with pain to endure to seek in health diseases cure to eat the grape unprund the vine laborious idleness is thine yet idleness of care complains and labor quarrels with its pains nor only found or made distress because externals fail to bless lodged in ourselves the taste and will that make externals good or ill no earthly blessing hence we find an equal good to all mankind belmore the soberst thing on earth dreads the broad laugh and roar of mirth while clerrio with a length of chin protracted by perpetual grin though socrates himself pass by must laugh in ridicule or die how elegant how high refined the palate of cardellas mind how low how vulgar cottas soul that feels no rapture in a vole see thousands as in love with strife pursue it fretting all their life and darken with the clouds of spleen the sky of providence serene wretched to find another eased and most unhappy when they are pleased how strange while some with patient toil raise comfort on a barren soil or pleasure strike by native dint from cruel fortunes hardest flint the patriarch like whose rod we are told earths stubborn fetters burst of old when gushed the stream from horebs rock to water israels thirsty flock hence not on earth a blessing sent gives universally content for while so varied is our taste manna itself were showrd to waste with reason therefore we profess god meant not here our happiness else in the various blessings given sure various minds might find their heaven but know as different we find each individuals turn of mind as little with ourselves we see ourselves at various times agree so often our views our tempers change as through lifes varied scenes we range at times so different from himself the prodigal will hoard his pelf spend greedily the night at play to throw next morn his gains away at times even misers rob their store and give their sixpence to the poor at times even trembling cowards fight and desperate put the bold to flight while sick of fighting and of fame the brave as belgic lions tame how often my friend in private life we love the maid we hate a wife how often the scene that gives delight at morn offends the eye at night it is not the want of that or this possession is the bane of bliss and hence of happiness we see on earth the impossibility yet with an interested view does still lorenzo truth pursue do thou suppose the enlightened mind in truths researches bliss may find that science fancy may restrain and fix that weathercock the brain alas deceive thy self no more but give thy vain pretensions over for as a world of fruitless cost in vain inquiries has been lost a world of labor spent to attain that knowledge man may never gain so millions all their lives have spent searching for bliss in discontent for bliss which but a little thought had told them never could be taught yet still they ask yet still they run a race that never can be won thus sought of yore projecting fools the summum bonum of the schools and wiser heads than those of old the stone converting all to gold or vain adepts much wiser still to wrest from natures band at will promethean theft celestial fire to animate their wood and wire madmen that not monro could cure of circles and their quadrature of thinking drunken nature reels like a slung coach on springs and wheels do thou instructed in thy youth to place consummate bliss in truth conceive it somewhere hidden lies among the learned and the wise that hence our bliss or misery flow the truth to know or not to know in vain the learned in science deep in search of bliss their vigils keep in vain the universe explore swift as their search it flies before through every clime on every wind and leaves the panting wish behind o tell me what connection ties so close the happy and the wise did ever the sage in wisdom find the artless infants peace of mind proud knowledge ever or boastful art restore to joy the broken heart ah what avails the truth to know when truths the frequent source of woe while gilded fictions dazzling rays with sunshine beautify our days or mildly shed its silver beams reflected light our nightly dreams while pleasure and its laughing train dance by the moonshine of the brain for what is knowledge but to know how ignorant our state below the more we learn the more to find beyond our learning still behind our fruitless wishes to increase whenever our mental prospects cease so far from happiness my friend is science in its means and end say thou that bliss the world affect the smile of god on his elect confined to abrams faithful seed and made dependent on our creed go ask the saints to whom are given the best assurances of heaven the few distinguished here on earth as children of a spiritual birth how gloomy often a state of grace how often hid their makers face how often by satan and by sin sore buffeted the man within these all confess beyond the sky their blissful heritage does lie say is reposed this heavenly trust within the bosom of the just while virtue in itself you call the happiness of one and all pretending still though yours and mine no partial mode of bliss define yet that our different tastes unite in meaning well and thinking right an universal moral this conducting all mankind to bliss alas what sophistry to tell of thinking right and meaning well pope  unless this rectitude of thought with perspicuity be taught this honest meaning plainly shown so often admired so little known at virtue if we are left to guess what is it to say it is happiness the way to virtue as to bliss if dubious that as doubtful this how fruitless therefore but to know virtue is happiness below say thou mankind are all agreed that happiness is virtues meed the service of the work inquire and by the labor rate the hire now virtue some to fact confine while others place it in design some blessed but for the good they do others for all they have in view but if by virtues understood the mere intent of doing good those fully virtuous may be held who never one lawless passion quelled whom never temptation led astray beyond the tenor of their way a sober path by stoics trod nor friends to man nor foes to god consistent with a state of rest if virtues centred in the breast as happy those may surely live who nothing give nor have to give as those who taste in every sense the exertions of benevolence some seeming difference yet we find what pangs affect the tender mind what exquisite sensations rise to hear the orphans piteous cries to feel the widows piercing woe when no relief we can bestow does virtue here rejoice the heart as when the generous ease impart when purest transports warm the breast that glows to succour the distressed and yet my friend twere wondrous hard if bliss the virtuous rich reward in poverty that virtues zeal should double all the pangs we feel each generous sigh each social tear but render want the more severe to virtue therefore if the deed our best designs must yet succeed granting that happy every mind in such proportion as its kind here in externals do we place the happiness of human race enabled to relieve distress as wealth or power ourselves possess for bliss capacitated more as blessed with fortunes worldly store fixed by this scheme the blissful state exclusive to the rich and great the virtuous poor but innocent claiming at the utmost bare content besides if individuals blessed as sharers only with the rest true happiness with thee to call not merely that of one but all what is inactive virtues use can it to social good conduce can it thus fruitless and confined be called a blessing to mankind if then we judge so much amiss of virtue and of virtuous bliss if faith tho crowned with alms and prayers has all its pangs has all its cares while even from knowledge prospects rise that makes us miserably wise his perfect happiness to reach no morals mortal man can teach still heavens bst votries must confess no blessings here completely bless a compound strange of bliss and woe mans variable state below some absent something ours to crave even from the cradle to the grave how idly then employed the mind in search of that we cannot find for human bliss stands never still our good inseprable from ill whilst all of pain and pleasure share their hour of joy their hour of care adapted to each several state fixed and determinate as fate the world my friend an ample field of such examples store does yield how throbs the infants little breast beneath a load of care oppressed the care that issues with a sigh the tear yet standing in the eye or caught in laughters dimple sleek dried up in stealing down the cheek see next among the sacheld crowd bold as a hero and as proud the little tyrant of his class how happy till condemned to parse or sob beneath the weightier curse of scanning lillys crabbed verse in youth how glows the vital fire tween expectation and desire our sanguine hopes our awkward fears all suiting unexperienced years still riper joys do manhood bless when fullblown fortune we possess we riot on the joyous store till health and strength can charm no more when disappointment and chagrin retaliate all our joys with spleen proportioned next to wasted age insipid joys and peevish rage tho dim the exhausted passions burn take to our latest gasp their turn thus relative my friend we find the pains and pleasures of mankind adapted all in due degree to human sensibility for see no more alive to smart than dead to joy the hardofheart

raptures of desire lo disappointment joins the curse and turns this worst affliction worse correct ideas let us gain our sense of joy we owe to pain so strange a paradox is this and misery to our sense of bliss while such our varying state below even joy degenrates into woe and pains in sufferance by degrees on their own pangs engender ease their antidote like poison bring texpel the poison of their sting the tension of thextended nerve with physiologists may serve the means of pleasure and of pain the seeming paradox texplain as strung the harp with trembling wire so braced with nerves the human lyre while such in tune these sages say the smiling hours in concert play but if in change too lax or tense health strikes no more the keys of sense but tremblingly alive all over the tortured strings in discord roar while sickness with her harpy claws stranger to each harmonious pause labors benumbed the jarring strain that stuns our ear with deafning pain nor yet can health too often repeat its music howsoever sweet while by degrees lo every string deprived of its elastic spring in general lassitude full soon the whole machine grows out of tune should also passion sense or art wind up too high the nervous part with noise the notes tumultuous tire or breaking strings unman the lyre of pain or pleasure on our frame the effects hence frequently the same thus full of gladness or of grief in tears we find the same relief alike the feeble nerve destroy exquisite pain extatic joy the bandit stretched upon the wheel the extreme of torture never can feel but cruelty disarming lies or dead to sense or really dies so rapture never meant to bless even joy grows pain when in excess indulged to print the burning kiss on chloes lips how fierce the bliss how keen the torture of her charms caressed to pant within her arms melting in fullness of desire stretched on the rack of bliss texpire thus constitutional below is all our bliss is all our woe each holding intimately joined alternate empire over the mind like persian monarchs hardly known ere tumbled headlong from the throne precarious and as short its sway deposed and sceptred in a day pleasure begins its fickle reign and tyrannizes into pain when as to cruel pain we bow its rod grows light we know not how ah cruel blow to human pride is pain and pleasure thus allied that all the sweets of life grow sour within the transitory hour complains lorenzo darts behind no ray of comfort on his mind if thus with varied joy and strife diversified allstates of life if human being cannot know a constant state of bliss and woe worn by sharp misery to the bones while grief with intermission groans and meagre want half fed the while grins forth her grateful ghastly smile tho vain our hopes of bliss as vain our fears of unremitting pain absurd the mischiefmaking care that leads us blindly to despair simkin a fairy tale written at school  crinem irroravit aquis  et neque jam color est misto candore rubori ovid in days of yore when elves were seen by moonlight dancing on the green leading in mystic steps their train over marshy mead or flowery plain a maiden with her milking pail tripd morn and eve across the vale patty the sweetest tempered lass that ever beat dewdrop from the grass but nature half unkind had shed illnatured influence on her head for oh the cause of many a care deeptinted red the virgins hair for sister nymphs she lived a jest and never was kissed among the rest now so it chanced that by the mead where pattys cows were used to feed there stood a mount on verdant ground with daisies strewn and violets crowned round which had many a timorous swain seen fairies sporting on the plain for under as the storys told they dwelt in palaces of gold safe in the bosom of the hill where they conveyed themselves at will or when they pleased from thence could rise invisible to mortal eyes by these the nymph was often seen with clearstarchd coif so neat and clean devoid of all that negligence that give the fairies just offense who trace the house with critic eye nor pass an unwashd trencher by but pinch severe the careless maid for room unswept or spoon mislaid they view in pity pattys hair and take the virgin to their care now as at dusky eve the maid sat milking mully in the shade simkin a sprite of neither sex that used old peevish maids to vex in flowing azure loosely dressed a thin transparent gauze its vest like that which now to us conveyed the modern females term a shade astride a vapor dancing came a will of the wisp its mortal name the same which boys so often ken from distant lake or foggy fen a cloud of light that leads astray travllers benighted on their way thus over hill and dale the maid the welldesigning simkin led till twelve a clock a solemn sound rung from a neighboring village round what time the nimble fairies tread the maiden daisies of the mead which scarcely bend beneath their weight so lightly trip their nimble feet how blessed the plain thrice fertile soil on which the fairies deign to smile no barren spot can here be found no weed nor thistle curse the ground nor here is heard the screechowls note nor omen from the ravens throat but thrush and blackbird sweetly sing and the glad cuckoo hails the spring here too the scented sweetbriar grows the woodbine wild and wild the rose the kingcup smiles with brighter bloom and violets breathe more sweet perfume to such a spot enchanted mead the sprightly elve does patty lead now from his bounding steed alights and mixes among his fellow sprights his bounding steed no more his care directly vanished into air now gentle patty in surprise around her turns her wandering eyes here some she saw with mighty care new moulding fancies for the fair here rose a head and there was seen improvements on a capuchin for all the milliner imparts is the result of fairy arts here stood a crowd in warm dispute about to form a birthday suit and there in consultation sat as many modelling a hat fast by inspired by female love the spreading petticoat to improve they met and in debate were high or is  or is it not  a fly others to greater deeds inclined were drawing morals for the mind and lo to this important end the fairy histories are penned the sprites to all invention new their slender fingers dip in dew and fill with deeds unknown before their tomes the leaves of sycamore hence are the loved of fairies taught and blessed with every brilliant thought who here peruse at early dawn the impressions on the dewy lawn ere yet an inauspicious wind leaves not a single tome behind or the refulgent sun exhales on one bright beam a thousand tales from hence each intellectual vapor they scrawl on mortal ink and paper so wretches vulgar things their care for mushrooms at the morn repair ere yet the expanding warmth of day dries their contracted sweets away a number more at different toil patty with terror viewed awhile when now a train approached the maid with sprightly simkin at their head who smiling tript before the rest and thus the trembling fair addressed fear not sweetest maid but see what the gift we bring to thee this the queen of fairies sent in a phial nicely pent drops by mooneyd elves distilled from the wild buds of the field mixed with liquids nicely caught which in acorn cups are brought filled before the peep of morn from the prickly

nymph with this bedew thine head no more shall glow thy locks with red of lovely brown shall be thy hair and thou the brightest of the sair this said the ken of rising day summoned each spright in

natures tournaments began inflamed with enmity and power gods human likeness to devour no  it is impossible a cause should counteract creations laws the hand of providence arrest or heavens determined power contest as one or other must prevail and one or both together fail but nature knows no real strife however jarring human life from evil and from error free these only relative to thee in icy

to help it forward at a stand impious like marlis does it take the pains to mend it did to make requiring endless cost and care to hold in tenable repair ah no however to us it seem creation is a perfect scheme lorenzo let not words deceive all imperfections relative since from conceived amendments came the patchwork we perfection name a term for something understood productive still of mortals good but of perfection absolute all nature is beyond dispute for all from god is here derived and all is perfect god contrived mans surely perfect then you cry as man most perfect i reply the creature of his makers will formed his good pleasure to fulfill destined in the universal plan to fill his place and act as man what tho on earth the human mind involved in ignorance we find impassioned fickle given to pride nor resting ever selfsatisfied does power comparative to improve perfection positive remove as well imperfect might we say the rising sun at early day since with superior heat and light it blazes in meridian height formed with progressive powers to rise from out the dust to tread the skies perfect as such humanity however lowly in degree how ignorant and weak are those who natures author then suppose in providence remains a spy to guard his work with watchful eye from fallen angels base intent the direful outrage to prevent to rescue or preserve his plan from that prodigious creature man like the young steed that scours the plain is nature wild and needs a rein or halts she like a foundered jade lame by her frequent stumbling made perhaps lorenzo some mistake concerning provideace we make the powers of nature to divide from its imaginary guide for if creation has in fact been long ago a finished act what end does laboring time pursue or what has providence in view for sure thou will not take the side of those whose ignorance and pride maintain the universe designed merely to gratify mankind a stage as on a strollers cart where drolls itinrant play their part in grinning mirth or brawling strife the tragicomedy of life was then heavens wondrous power displayed this system in perfection made only to wear itself away stupendous frame for mere decay its worlds to wander through the void destroying till themselves destroyed or in some future fabled days to take imaginary blaze at flames that all to ruin turn annihilating as they burn riskd then the censure of my wit i hold the world unfinished yet time building what heavens wisdom planned creations work even yet in hand through natures scenes in order range see all things in continual change all to some point progressive run to do or else to be undone existing for so short a space thousands we know but by their place which changed by changing form we say the things themselves are passed away no proofs of being objects bring whose essence ever on the wing flown from their forms ere yet defined leaves no identity behind but waving this yet find we here no abstract cause of ill to fear since on the feelings of mankind depends the every ill we find whence tho our sufferings ill we call they have no abstracted cause at all for stripped creation of mankind no evil would be left behind to this will cavillers reply we ask not where those causes lie if in externals be the oiffence or in the pravity of sense that real ill exists is plain while man is sensible of pain in answer my lorenzo here no vaunting stoicism fear nor think thy friend so madly wise to affeft his misries to despise i never presume that point to reach nor against the voice of nature preach none feel more tenderly than i mine the soft heart and watery eye the sanguine hopes the groundless fears still unsubdud by sense or years ah too susceptible of pain when vice or folly bat complain yet even while tears of anguish flow i hold no abstract ill we know it is true my friend no man alive could in his senses gravely strive the wretch in torture to persuade of evil not to be afraid the murderer mangled on the wheel to smile at harmless rope and steel or that the blows that loitering kill cannot be physically ill asurd the argument and vain since all we know of ill is pain and yet as neither grieved nor pained of evil man had never complained if relative our bliss and woe reciprocally ebb and flow it is palpable that joy and strife are but the modes of human life which varied with consummate skill may on the whole be good nor ill say thou the learned are agreed the ills of life the good exceed lorenzo peevish sick or vain how natural is it to complain but fure experience here denies this threadbare maxim of the wise behold the weak the blind the lame the sons of poverty and shame the wretch expiring by degrees by amputations or disease such whose vile lot the world their foe contempt and beggary below should thou to this or that propose in death a cure for all their woes tell em oppressed with human strife wide stand the numerous doorsof life with open arms the wretch to save rest welcomes misery to the grave how few your recipe will try tho dying piecemeal loath to die nor merely from the fear of worse tenacious of a present curse for say annihilation here the all poor mortals have to fear how few would yet their ills incline their sense of being to resign to part on terms like these from pain with pleasure never to meet again even nature shudders at the thought to sink inconscious into naught in mere existence sure mankind must then intrinsic pleasure find some good equivalent must feel to such supposed excess of ill since thus in death so loath to part the aching head and bleeding heart may not indeed all human woe be balanced by our joys below do them lorenzo doubt of this how do thou measure earthly bliss it is not by ecstasy alone thy actual share of joy is known duration adds to the degree as much as its intensity joy for a moments space how small pain instantaneous none at all through life continued little less even bare content than happiness the joyous ecstasy of bliss dilating rarefied to this be it on individuals tried each needs but to be satisfied the longing wish the sigh is over when once content we ask no more thus equal joy we often taste in shortlived pleasures snatched in haste as others or when raptured less for years even we ourselves possess hence often asserted in dispute that time ideas constitute sense of duration so confined to that which passes in the mind the expectant lover thinks in rage his stellas absent hour an age while short and sweet the moments fly when love and she sit smiling by nor given their epithets in vain to fleeting joy and lingering pain in minutes flown each joyful day each sad one whild in hours away nay tho of life tenacious all longevity no bliss we call in different animals at least the less the greaters constant feast it is probable their joys and strife are suited to their term of life whence equal pleasure equal pain may longlived elephants sustain with young ephemerons whose flight at noon beginning ends at night during which momentary space they rise love battle and embrace fluttering around till out of breath they drop into the arms of death from felfexperience do thou rate the real hardship of thy fate art thou with every friend at strife see thou no gentle joy in life do thou no favorite scheme possess that yields contemplative success have thou no hope no good do choose a good thou would not die to lose thy day thus clouded at the dawn will brighter shine its clouds withdrawn or is thy morn of sunshine past with clouds thy evnings overcast would of its brightness know the amount bring morn and evening to account stands nature then so long abused of abstract evil thus excused as little truth is understood by those who hold all nature good whatever is is right  it may but therefore good we cannot say unless some general bliss we see arise from partial misery in spite of truth in reasons spite when vexed or pained we all denyt never till the pain be over confessing that was which never is a blessing the terms then here misunderstood rights not equivocal to good goodness adapted and confined to the appetites of humankind the right unknown to you or me tho sure what is is fit to be let plato then or leibnitz prate of goodnsess influencing fate or idle sophists still contest their boasted principle the best by disputants or either side the partial term is misapplied that god is good they know full well but what his goodness none can tell unless to man his kindness shown his goods dependent on our own lorenzo merely to mankind thus evil physical confined of moral next a puzzling task an explanation do thou ask say thou heavens care no more extends to physical than moral ends the same the providential power that rains the soft refreshing shower that in the womb of teeming earth its atoms quickens into birth does in the moral scene connect the cause and consequent effect on virtue peace of heart bestows softens the good mans casual woes abandons vice to fell despair or plagues with heartcorroding care concluding hence that moral ill opposing natures righteous will aloud for heavens dread vengeance calls the curse that on the guilty falls so far lorenzo i with thee in part most readily agree that vice will leave a sting behind and virtue its reward shall find yet all with good st paul confess without a law we cannot transgress now natures law is heavens command whose will no mortal can withstand how lives earths animated clod to contravene the will of god as well adventurous of his neck the laws of gravity to break presumptuous man might seek to fly a creeping earthworm to the sky or don the bishops winged shoon to trip it yarely to the moon what curse soever then vice provoke creations laws can never be broke but know by physical alone is moral good or evil known for had not vice the power to vex its evil never would perplex each moral thus a partial ill permitted by the eternal will to mortals relative the offense and punishments of providence lorenzo state the matter clear be pain and pleasure strangers here strangers to pleasures and to pain what motives had we to complain suppose we then in natures plan to exist the antomaton of man rising from senseless matters arms which perfect rest nor grieves nor charms should heaven a consciousness bestow subject to good or ill below not real pain or pleasure give but only make the form to live as yet from all reflection clear unnervd by hope unawed by fear suppose to action thus consigned this naked unaffected mind lorenzo with precision hence let us infer the consequence ere yet existed moral ill the first sole agent was the will reason without the power to act to censure or advise a fact as from experience naught it knew of good or bad or false or true for reason its conclusion draws from similar effect and cause no instinct faculty or sense securing actual innocence that bids us virtues steps pursue or points to bliss it never knew else giving reason bounteous heaven had also actual pleasure given this not supposed  hence reasons use some known effect must introduce now as innate if we maintain a love of bliss and hate of pain directed as the passions fired the will to pleasure first aspired the moral agent bound to choose from natures most immediate views but prone to censure and complain suppose our first sensation pain let pain or pleasure be attained of both an equal sense was gained as the first tree of knowledge bore of good and evil equal store for when the mind one pleasure knew its neutral state of rest withdrew pleasure and pain by contrast known criteria of each other grown hence felt the initiated mind the sting which pleasure left behind and reason did to act commence on the information of the sense still as the passions ebb and flow now swollen with bliss now sunk in woe tracing the bounds the extremes between of innocence that golden mean but ah the fluctuating tide of passion does this mean deride consistent only it is confessed with nature in a state of rest here then from moral actions came the necessary ill we blame running selflove in full career reason her guide not always near her satisfaction often pursuing tho at her own and others ruin the indulgence of the human will we hence presume is moral ill whenever from such indulgence flows more pain than pleasure it bestows in guilt original involved here see the wondrous mystery solved to the first man no more confined than passions found in every mind is the plain cause of moral woe sin human frailty here below lorenzo evil understood the dies reverse is moral good whatever more pleasure yields than pain not indeed solely to the agent but to mankind or the moral world in general  the name of goodness does obtain unsatisfied lorenzo yet do thou lost happiness regret does from our plan of morals seem still providence no perfect scheme because perplexed with fear or pain even virtue covets bliss in vain do thou against the cause object it is disproportioned to the effect thus in the intemprance of the will to place the source of moral ill our passions but a natural cause obedient to creations laws here palpably too innocent the cause of misery to be meant must i repeat it over again from pleasure flows our sense of pain dependent these as light and shade through life each others contrast made whence tho to moderation joined contents serenity of mind while vice but sports with higher glee to sink as low in misery proportioned to the guilty joy the pangs intemperance annoy yet on the whole no abstract ill does here confront the eternal will of evil all the effected strife but relative to human life say thou indeed if man confined to fill the place by heaven assigned but partially to rise or fall why feels he misery at all another question answers this what title have mankind to bliss during thy life if man and boy thy share of both thou may enjoy if perfect rest the certain mean our pleasures and our pains between null the momentum of our pain who shall of providence complain see thou incumbering the ground the barren fig trees branching round while virtue stands the brunt of vice and knaves possess fools paradise it is here indeed our error lies our virtues we too highly prize and adequate rewards to find create them fondly to our mind not satisfied on heaven to trust or think its dispensations just unless his conduct god submit to our investigating wit here toiling as an humble drudge for man his critic lord and judge what merit in thy makers eye that thou vain man art six feet high to heaven must all with shame agree unprofitable servants we unworthy of celestial dress the rags of human righteousness the all that virtue has to boast claiming the worlds regard at most as virtue here so vice depends ourselves our guilt the most offends for know proud man no act of thine renders defective gods design no power to human frailty given to injure unpreventing heaven presume not at so high a price to rate the iniquity of vice nor let the vainlyvirtuous fool projecting heaven by line and rule sore lashed and wasting to the bone the crimes of health and ease to atone conceive by want of rest or meat the eternal purpose to defeat presume not at so cheap a rate to hold the omnipotence of fate yet who shall say that guilt is free or promise vice impunity since it is so plain the sting of woe to joy inordinate does grow while none from virtues paths would stray if pleasure did not lead the way can virtue also hence despair since virtues providences care compensing pleasure due to pain nor this nor that bestowed in vain let fools when hard their present lot think distant heaven has earth forgot in discontent aloud complain that all our trust in heaven is vain pretending god the world protects and yet its several parts neglects do thou lorenzo better taught never indulge so wild a thought conceiving the individual man no charge on natures general plan what tho impossible that we at once the whole and parts should see to single objects here confined the attention of the human mind yet shall we blasphemously join heavens intellects with yours and mine know thou the worlds great architect its smallest part shall not neglect as needful in the stately pile as golden roofs the abutments vile nor in their kind more perfect they the parian stones than potters clay how sadly blundering in the dark here st john missed his boasted mark when heavens omnipotence tenhance he almost gave the world to chance supposing god too great to mind the peccadillos of mankind too insignificant our claim to deitys immediate aim or rather from his reasons given he thought the task too great for heaven too puzzling for the eternal wit to hold its state and thus submit wherefore like the idiot at a loss to count heaven takes us in the gross lorenzo probable the scheme however strange the doctrine seem whatever the next world give in this that virtue has its share of bliss while all accounts tween vice and woe are settled and discharged below no balance to receive or pay left shuffling for a future day go make an estimate of life compare the sums of joy and strife each in its separate degree duration and intensity perhaps upon the whole you will find that nothings due to human kind nor loss nor profit in the trade of transient pains and pleasures made meantime how difficult to guess at real objects of distress how difficult in fact to trace where real pleasure has a place see shuddering at

wretch for whom we sigh in cruel tortures doomed to die to pain superior fear or shame exulting smiles amidst the flame makes his proud judge with malice swell and triumphs over death and hell proportioned to the weight of care gives nature thus the power to bear but partial judges we it is plain of others joy or others pain so vice and virtue could we trace neither is stamped upon the face

not atheism in the eye of those who atheism most decry who made the world with equal skill can surely guide it if he will who then appearances shall trust to think that heavens on earth unjust when vice and virtue may relate solely to mans sublunar state and here for ought we truly know be paid their dues of joy and woe yet think not thou i here deny that virtuous souls ascend the sky or that

and be forgot or if it prove our future fate to know an intellectual state in death to perish or to rise immortal to our native skies allured by wit to neither side be reason our impartial guide let us lorenzo fairly weigh what argument has here to say have thou poor dromios sophisms got who bids us vegetate and rot man but a rank and useless weed prove them alike and it is agreed but the analogy of parts is all that is proved by skeptic arts say that of vegetable race we spread the root from place to place the lovely flower of beauty blows twin sister to the province rose allures at morn the gazing eye that ere the evening sees it die say years disrobe the mantled brow as winter strips the autumnal bough the rough rude blast to both unkind both perish by an eastern wind or by the ax untimely blow are laid their spreading honors low admit lorenzo this be true go on  the parallel pursue say the tall elms you stately row sweet transports of sensation know when zephyrs kiss the lilys breast the lilys rapture be confessed say the broad oak when thunders roar fears till the thunderstorm be over conscious of doubt and dread by turns stands trembling as the forest burns alive awake to natures laws from natures scenes experience draws throbbing its trunk with hopes and fears grown old in wisdom as in years is this absurd absurd indeed lorenzo how unlike a weed to moral arguments do run here shall we end as we begun say thou the virtuous when they die in their own right ascend the sky the wicked here unpunished go to torment in the world below heavens justice else we should arraign and prove the virtuous good in vain you take my friend for granted here what none by reason make appear that vice at god almightys hands eternal punishment demands while endless bliss beyond the skies justice bestows as virtues prize justice lorenzo what my friend by justice do thou here intend her sword she holds but say what ails the equilibrium of her scales how low the one tho empty lies to kick the beam while to other flies alas i see by what compelled in different mediums are they held one in material fluids buoyed the other in a perfect void weighed in eternity and time the punishment against the crime dare the selfrighteous tribe to say that heavens no more than virtues pay while vice demerits endless woe needs god a friend fears god a foe holding vindictive rage in store for his own sake on man to pour o no  unhurt the almighty cause or kept or broken human laws cease then presumption to contend that mortals heaven can so offend as at an infinite expense to answer a finite offense to pay the fine immortal made which else they never could have paid the dying wretch tho tyrants cure but tortures longer to endure with nature cruelly at strife when criminals are quit with life can god whose tender mercies flow over all his varied works below whose loving kindness all confess whose name the distant nations bless say can this god of boundless love vengeful as earthly tyrants prove o shame lorenzo shame to all who cruelty can justice call such argument beside is vain unless the premises were plain unless we first could make it clear that vice can never be punished here that virtue must be ever blessed for following but its interest or that we truly could define that justice mortals call divine by metaphysics do thou strive to keep the man in death alive would thou set moral pleas aside the body from the soul divide material that and born to die while this a native of the sky objects that none can hear and see hence claiming immortality but say is thy corporeal claim laid to the matter or the frame is it the substance of the heart or make that is the mortal part does change of form bring death alone form we must immaterial own if to the essence of the clay again mortality we lay doomed the loathed carcass to the worm the substance changes but its form through modes of being given to range immortal in perpetual change matter by all the skeptic crowd essentially the same allowed in death in life our shame our pride in various forms but modified say then the matter or the frame or both in body have a claim nor mortal nor immortal we from our materiality lorenzo does thy bosom beat to claim in heaven the immortal seat so fond of thy existence here do thou annihilation fear to fall as undistinguished clay to dumb forgetfulness a prey the joys of paradise in view say thou thy claim must needs be true else wherefore does thy fond desire to immortality aspire whatever in hope be heavens intent this is my friend no argument i too perhaps so pleased to live my very means of life might give all i am worth from death to save if hope were buried in the grave but let lorenzo never trust to wish or hope however just nor let a passionate desire to reasons sober task aspire would thou false principles defend because they serve a pleasing end who loves the truth will sure despise her cause to rest on specious lies what merit does it add to worth that knaves its virtues babble forth what added weight or consequence in suffrage gives the fool to sense again is it said so closely joined in life the body and the mind reciprocally formed to bear each others weight of pain and care sharing alike the mutual joy which either wholly may destroy since thus together both concur we know not either to prefer if both be purposely combined in use of body or of mind are there who weakly hence suppose the soul no separate being knows but as the body does decay so wears the mortal mind away yet wherefore might not at our birth lodged in this tenement of earth locked up for life the immortal mind its temporary prison find till paid our vital debt should be and death should set the captive free meanwhile in hope in fear in doubt concerning friends and foes without prone through its prison grates to pry it sees times scattered ruins lie in darkness and confusion hurled the embryo of another world why may not thus on earth be joined the body and the tenant mind thinhabitant with cost and care keeping his mansion in repair used to the dungeon where he lies and prone his present home to prize unknowing whither doomed to roam if once bereft of house and home what wonder then for help he calls when danger threats his tottering walls nor strange if heedlessof their fate they tumble on his wareless pate each others mutual strength and ward the mansion and the mansions lord what tho we hold the soul to be attached to sensibility concludes lorenzo rashly hence the souls as mortal as the sense alleging that in life we find perception to the organs joined poor mortals of sensation void as these are damaged or destroyed therefore the soul on sense depends and with the failing organ ends lorenzo through a darkened glass see thou but faintly objects pass more darkened yet do thou confess thy certainty of vision less with its transparency thy sight decreasing till obstructed quite suppose it broke or let it fall do think thou could not see at all ridiculous when objects lie all open to the naked eye thus may the soul to body joined be deaf irrational or blind but take the obstructing organs hence at liberty its native sense by fits no more it hears and sees as now by piecemeal and degrees in partial modes adapted here to organs of the eye and ear but intellect all ear all eye it reads the wonders of the sky at once what nature can disclose of scientific secrets knows now sense and science both combined in each perception of the mind but here lorenzo for a while lay by the metaphysic foil with this behind our darkened glass too apt to make a blundring pass by much more anxious on the whole to guard the body than the soul too nice the anatomizing art to take them dexterously apart let us on

prate of nature and a natural state the arts of social life despise and think that brutes are only wise pretending better had it been if kings and priests we never had seen if lawless ignorant and wild man had been left while yet a child with brutes to share a common fate more blessed than in his present state go thou and act a social part mans natural states a state of art twas nature when the world was young made loose our first great grandsires tongue taught his wild sons the force of speech and gave the human power to teach to social converse tuned the ear gave mutual love and mutual fear inspired the hero warmed the friend and bade the strong the weak defend twas nature gave religions rule and bade the wise conduct the fool in justice gave the law to save the weak and honest from

maker god adore all this you artificial call i heed not empty terms at all call it by whatsoever name it is human natures special claim say from mere phrases to depart how differs nature here from art within the solitary wood rears the old brock her helpless brood for safety scouring to her den at sight or sound of dogs and men it is nature warns her not to expose herself or offspring to her foes but sends her to the safe retreat where both enjoy their rest and meat why rears not man in forest wild or acorn grove his favorite child but lodged in towns and nursed with care protects and feeds his fondled heir experter sure were human race if trained in forests for the chase the chase that might our food provide and what need animals beside lorenzo here we plainly find the characters that mark our kind twas nature knowledge did impart which time has ripened into art but call it art or what you will it is nature human nature still as natural for us my friend to bid the cloudcapt towers ascend to bid the floating castles ride on moving mountains of the tide as for the bird and beast their food to seek in thicket plain or wood to build the nest or dig the den far distant from the haunts of men science disprove it those who can is therefore natural to man to other animals denied this best and worst excuse for pride there are it is true who gravely hold grimalkins no essential

the brute a power of reason spite of pride no more to him than man denied so much admitting do thou say i fairly throw my cause away unless to brutes heaven also give in immortality to live lorenzo no

nature all enjoy the powers heaven meant them to employ passion nor instinct ever bestowed on man or beast a useless load but serving animals in kind to the end for which they were designed this once

on earth get j  n  n a reprieve ralph moulseys description of richmond playhouse where hodge ye great oaf have you been that you have not yet been to the play the playhouse at richmond i mean which in faith is most gallant and gay we shewfolk have seen before now enact kings and queens in a barn but this is a palace i vow and a costly one too as i learn i stard as you will think all about to see such a wonderful thing but i found when the secret came out twas designed to be fit for the king god blessn had he but been there and the queen i would have gin half a crown for they come not to wake nor to fair and it is miles up to london fine town tho else there were smart folks enough no wonder enticed by such skill for they played so  i cannot tell how but i dote on that maid in the mill so sweetly she sings without doubt i could like and i am sure so could you  could a body but bring it about but pize on it the maids married too yet acting apart there is the scenes all fresh as the barleymow sign shifting backwards and forwards like skreens and painted most desperate fine then simple tho i as a sheep the man of the show was so kind as to let me just have a bopeep at the fine actorpeople behind there i thought to have found out a flam for of tinsel and stuff i have been told but their dresses ecod were no sham but velvet and silver and gold in the greenroom which i took for blue gay ladies i saw richly dressed and some of them handsome ones too but their manners were none of the best for a lass with one leg in the air the other kneehigh to be seen with her head leaning back on her chair looked like a carved ivory queen her red pouting nib lay so fair for a kiss had i feared no denial but her eyes sparkled  do if you date so ralph was afraid to stand trial on the stage did you see her but dance and skip here and there like a vapor she would fling you soon into a trance to see what you would see every caper for whisking and frisking about as nimble and light as a feather her petticoat makes such a rout that ones heart and her heels go together so hodge if so be youre inclined to the play we will go lad together next week if i hold in the mind and god sends the farmers good weather on human certitude and the universality of science an epistle to lorenzo not to the fount of hippocrene nor groves of laurel ever green nor where the sportive graces stray with flowers is strown the muses way lorenzo no i more rejoice at reasons bold and manly voice than at the softest sprightliest air mirth ever sung to lighten care truths sober tale more pleased to hear than all that tickle fancys ear tho such to babbling echo sweet aloud the public voice repeat her numbers then let truth excuse tho rudely sing the unpolished muse careless of ornament and proud to differ from the singsong crowd so boastful of the poor pretense to swell with sound the starveling sense truth hopes not for poetic praise to fiction sacred are the bays do thou demand ingenuous youth what is and who does teach the truth i answer  would thou learn of me it is that wherein mankind agree at least no safer truths we know than what the world will grant us so the truth indeed as sages tell of yore lay buried in a well so deep that hid for want of light from every peering mortals sight the more suspicious than the rest conceived its being was a jest and as no soul could find it out that fact itself was all a doubt philosophizing train of thought since by improving moderns caught who tell us nature tricked mankind when giving eyes she left us blind heaven making fools and thinking fit to play upon their want of wit but sure we boldly may receive as truth what all mankind believe such universal faith a guide in skepticism itself implied yet say thou till the world unite to fix on some one rule of right enquiry still is at a pause still vague investigations laws lorenzo all with you and me in points demonstrable agree conviction right or wrong the test of truth in every human breast for what is demonstratively so believers even profess to know on science hence our search must rest an universal rule confessed laid then those subtilties aside where human certitudes denied inquiry safely may proceed to form its scientific creed let priors solomon profess his science all uncertain guess the egregious sophist but affirms a contradiction even in terms for who his ignorance can suppose of what he is conscious that he knows do thou my pupil still delay in search of truth afraid to stray if placed belief in points alone that are demonstratively known these much too few and too confined to serve the purpose of mankind lorenzo see to commonsense how just how general the pretense to nation climate age or sect unlimited without respect hence howsoever wide we stray when church or system lead the way all of necessity agree in what alike they hear and see for not a son of adams race innate conviction can efface the highland loon the lowland lout wild irish fierce and cambrian stout the boor that rhynlands polder drains tho reason slumber in his brains all the same premises in view the same conclusions ever drew for know that like our mother earth its human offspring at its birth where fertile clay and barren sand compose the variegated land the unequal strata of the soil unequally demand our toil the rich that toil with gain repay thrown on the poor our pains away in mans uncultivated mind so varied is the soil in kind the flowers of science fresh and fair on some expand without our care on others scarce by culture grow the buds that wither as they blow yet here essentially allied howevr else diversified the fertile marl the steril sand alike the seed or plant demand denied alike spontaneous grain to bergens rocks and baiaes plain so not a truth innate our own the seeds of knowledge must be sown experience slow must swell the root and tend the fibers as they shoot or speedier aid instruction grant and slips of foreign growth implant the mental and material claim here too essentially the same grow seed or plant wherever it will in kind it is propagated still no soil nor climate can produce from tares the barleys potent juice to thorns no culture can assign the purple honors of the vine thus when by simple natures aid put forth sensations tender blade if to perfection hearer brought it bloom and ripen into thought wherever situate the root the same its intellectual fruit its taste its form perhaps we blame but still its genus is the same in this no poverty of soil no dullness ever mocked our toil if vainly then in lettered pride the scholar deep is dignified so false so empty the pretense of wits to more than commonsense if plain to the idiot as to you the immediate object of his view while even the blockhead truly knows far as his little science goes consistent sures our confidence in search of truth on commonsense that general index to mankind to taste and genius unconfined pointing in all one common way by dullness shortened but its ray of wit and knowledge all the end in length that radius to extend in stubborn age or pliant youth its bearing in the line of truth a needle constant to the pole whence beams true faith upon the soul do thou object if commonsense so plausible an evidence and all mankind of this possessed that any differ from the rest know thou when honest minds dissent misunderstoods their argument different the premises appear else were the fixed deduction clear hence half our numerous quarrels rise we see not with each others eyes so that precisely all alike nor terms nor things conception strike for every individual draws his plan by mere perspective laws fixed to one station time and place in power no full survey to trace the false mistaking often for true observed at different points of view so when to cheat the partial sight and prove in mirth that black is white with lights disposed the shades between in folds is spread the artful scene opposed the colors strike the eye and he affirms what you deny here spotless all appears and fair perceived a total blackness there the demonstration of his sight who doubts who knows not black from white thus evidence supports dispute nor one the other can refute and yet is commonsense to blame the premises were not the same were these alike tho say you err both would infallibly concur for take each others point of sight and set at once the matter right conceive not then because we find one source of truth in every mind we ever shall individuals see at every time and place agree as soon amidst yon grove of trees while plays a constant eastern breeze we every single spray shall find in one direction west reclined for tho to truth alike our claim our taste nor sentiments the same for dusky green the jaundicd eye mistakes the clearblue summer sky the distant scene however bright is darkness to the shortofsight to loaded ears as whispers still the clack and thunder of the mill thus lost as colors on the blind on dullness qualities refined than music to the deaf no more to ignorance the abstracted lore hence often objection calls us out to satisfy the blockheads doubt who not one proof whereon depends his sought solution comprehends the tritest arguments of yore in vain repeated over and over proving how fruitless were the toil the jarring world to reconcile and yet as but from time and place our several modes of thought we trace alas how blindly do we run each others heresy to shun our own our glory and our pride while curses all the rest betide by pious children doomed their ire by fires their children to hellfire heirs to salvations brighter sphere so strangely damned and damning here thus calvin ignorantly raves at souls which therefore luther saves to both denied lord peters keys who shuts out heretics like these and yet even those who boast to feel their bosoms burn with christian zeal who dooming dervizes to hell with pride uncharitable swell in nazreth bred or bethlem born had laughed our saviors birth to scorn mere turks denounced for you and me the bitter fruit of zacons tree to eat with fiends below the doom of antimahomet and rome yet blind as sampson when despair had sunk his life below his care the numbers wanton gaza lost destroyed but at his proper cost halfwitted zeal of all the test itself condemns among the rest for if required by gracious heaven our service but as knowledge given should i in pope or mufti trust for proving to their tenets just your rule to censure me or mine holds the like condemnation thine yet still more wicked weak and blind this reprobating zeal we find when void of truth absurd and vain the tenets zealots thus maintain for sure ridiculous and odd that zeal precipitate for god so short of knowledge that indeed it understands not even its creed for know whatever the world pretend but few believe what they defend in modes of faith tho falsehood taught nonsense is equally their fault thousands by forms of speech deceived never yet by mortal man believed creeds penned as said at heavens command in terms no soul can understand or such tho thundered from on high that plainly give themselves the lie but sure if words no sense convey faith in their uttrance dies away nor can a single son of eve apparent falsehood ever believe belief no vague declaimers rant no bigots creed no sophists cant it is not the scripture text to quote to get our catechism by rote over homilies to spend the day at midnight half asleep to pray to chatter matins at the dawn or gabble with the man of lawn true faith that consciousness of soul that times nor accidents control save those adapted and combined to root conviction from the mind for know that neither threat nor blows sincere belief can ever impose the monks hot zeal the jesuits skill lead not conviction as they will go turn inquisitor and burn the heretics all round in turn the turk refusing to resign his sensual paradise for thine the indian that in death pretends to visit but his former friends unless his faith what you may tell of joys in heaven and pains in hell not one of all the suffering tribe thy sentiments perforce imbibe however induced by hope or fear the mind is no free agent here to change their faith beyond the power of martyrs at their dying hour how idly then enthusiasts rave of systems that will damn or save or think true proselytes to gain by torture gallows whip or chain since ever constant to its cause true faith depends on natures laws by nonsense nor caprice misled the honest heart and sober head how idly wild fanatics preach while ignorant of what they teach the spirit never affects the mind unless with the understanding joined nor has the word if void of sense to gospel power the least pretense some certain meaning hence and plain a saving faith must needs contain if fixed its object sure no less the sense of terms our creed express a parrot else if none deceive her a sound and orthodox believer convinced as much as ever yet the athanasian paroquet let not fanaticism deceive none can a mystery believe tho plunged by zeal in error deep while commonsense lies fast asleep their faith rash bigots strangely boast the strongest his who is cheated most who least for truth presumes to search but headlong runs into the church for laid thy hand upon thy heart the formule of thy creed impart do thou its substance comprehend lo all its mysterys at an end in spite of their misguiding zeal here to their hearts let all appeal enough if just be their pretense to honesty and commonsense here rests that umpire of mankind conscience the god within the mind at eastern temples as of yore without the threshold of the door in reverence did the zealot use to doff and leave his dirty shoes like him the modern faithful taught that reason is a thing of naught lest they should soil the church with doubt their understandings leave without for ask who thus in mystery trust if euclids demonstrations just if truth the geometric art or subtle algebra impart unknowing what precisely meant they honestly refuse assent confess they first must comprehend before they credit or contend o self condemned o dead to shame have these a conscience void of blame who take no worldly points on trust but scruple till they know them just yet their supreme concerns will rest on tenets half the world contest conviction openly defy and with their tongues their hearts belie these the true faithful shall we call these have alas no faith at all for howsoeer with art they strive to keep absurdity alive clothed in equivocal disguise or garb of truth their specious lies still commonsense unrooted out will find a flaw to fix a doubt and where one doubt is left behind no firm belief informs the mind yet is there whose officious zeal pretends a consciousness to feel a fixed internal evidence of axioms hid from commonsense a stronger testimony given by inspiration breathed from heaven lorenzo neither you nor i what god reveals can ever deny but here how needful to be wise to know where revelation lies art them thyself ihspird by heaven tell me what certain proof is given do thou intuitively view what reason tells thee must be true no revelation here required how proves such truth that you are ihspird for why inspired if but to tell what reason might have told as well as truth beholds thy mental eye what seems to all the world a lie thy proof imagination strong here also may thou still be wrong if heaven has ever fired conceit brandy has also done the feat nay often the infatuateofbrain of heavens presumed injunctions vain have madly broke its dread commands and dipped in blood their murdering hands if god or devil then inspire of reason still we must inquire and reason doubtless would reply heaven never yet revealed a lie on others gifts confiding more do give thine own pretensions over do from the inspired thy faith receive and pin it on thy neighbors sleeve reason or heaven must tell thee too if such be more inspired than you where then the proof i frankly own to me yet uninspird unknown such guides to me by madness fired as madmen with the turks inspired in spite of middleton and hume do thou on miracles presume to revelation these thy guide thy faith by wonders verified go thou and easy of belief my comrade ask if i am a thief if inspirations false and true sure miracles suspicious too and hence thy conduct most absurd to take for one the others word our souls how long to damn and save has subtle priestcraft played the knave its pupils trained from early youth to equivocate and hide the truth to practice the deception nice of tricking hand or quaint device to cheat the palate nose and eye and gild that dirty pill a lie yet do thou miracles maintain be here thy definition plain the muse disdaining to reply to such as shock the naked eye events as miracles do own whose cause immediate is unknown or is thy faith established more on actions never performed before alas my muchbelieving friend the times of yore might these defend when heretic freethinkers rose that dared the holy church oppose for infidelity renowned asserting that the globe was round vile heresy whence doomed to hell upsals good bishop martyr fell wretches so impious as to hold the earth about its axis rolled and as the years their courses run still took its journeys round the sun vile heresy for which it is said old galileo too had bled had not the sage more loath to die recanting damned it for a lie ego galileo cord sincero et fide non ficta abjuro maledico et detestor supradictos errores et haereses  in days of ignorance like these when legends had the power to please while love of wonder salvd deceit and gudgeons swallowed whole the cheat how little strange that monks and friars should prove miraculously liars or converts to divines so sad turn out miraculously mad but now a century worn away time working wonders every day the vast discovries years have made have spoilt the wondermongers trader would thou since facts so strange of yore are now miraculous no more thy genuine miracles define as real acts of power divine the effects of some immediate cause in fact transgressing natures laws how  did the omnipotent on high let those his laws at random fly or was his providence so blind to what omnisciency designed that still his sovereign will attends to strike his foes or skreen his friends that power beyond the almightys art to natures system to impart needful heavens arbitrary fire to blast a fig tree or a liar lorenzo be not thou so vain to think thus brittle natures chain from which whatever link we strike tenth or ten thousandth broke alike connecting systems all destroyed unballancd worlds would strew the void to atoms burst restored again old chaos to his ancient reign unless in time the god attend the works of his own hand to mend alas how blasphemous to say that heaven can save no other way or that for trifles or in joke creations sacred orders broke for do we not in fact confess if god may natures laws transgress the wise creator wanted skill his vast intentions to fulfill or that the intention tho his own was in the extent to him unknown or still more impiously imply that heaven can give itself the lie say then that miracles there be they are but miraculous to thee so many links concealed remain which form the complicated chain true causes and effects between in natures providential scene what tho without an obvious cause we see inverted customs laws must we immediately infer that nature from itself can err commanded by the word divine say water changed itself to wine graves opened wide their ponderous jaws a breath the sole apparent cause ah who shall boast that god revere creations laws were broken here might not ten thousand springs unite causes too fine for mortal sight such varied wonders to produce to providential ends of use formed when by heaven its power displayed the earths foundation first was laid or when that logos was designed by miracles to save mankind think not lorenzo nature strays whenever the world is in amaze extend thy view from pole to pole see one great miracle the whole where all events their cause succeed as once the great firstcause decreed where order still from order flows and never interruption knows capricious but to mortal sense the harmony of providence how

like old wives in winter nights hear see and feel and chat with sprights their prudent caution therefore just who waking dreamers seldom trust to whom light visions fact may seem and fact itself an

but innocent in actual virtue true indeed i see no hopes we should succeed if once by reason grown so tame that naught our passions could inflame for say desires may not extrude a sense of moral rectitude this only points to what is right but never to virtue can excite reason indiffrent to the event merely bestows its cold assent as far as truths concerned in part speaks to the head but not the heart reason bestowed an humble friend not to keep faultless but to mend with hopes to cheer or fears to bind selflove a glutton deaf and blind to give our scene of action light to check the sensual appetite to show us what is good ahd fair and passions blunders to repair to virtue sense of right and wrong must of necessity belong but from this knowledge who infer the conscious party cannot err nay founded on such sense our claim to bear of vice the moral blame the fool the mad do what they will standing excused of moral ill say then the virtuous must be wise in wisdom say thou virtue lies by other motives must the mind to virtuous actions be inclined what other motive do thou ask lorenzo difficult the task to unravel here the human mind its moral principles to find say thou we all true virtue love and virtue that which all approve supposing this yet is it with you that very approbation too is this lorenzo what is meant by virtue sprung from sentiment see hume on the general principles of morals  by that ambiguous term of art the native goodness of the heart pride not yourselves ye pharisees that acts of kindness give you ease nor think ye publicans from heaven an evil inclinations given know that from different passions vice and virtue take not separate rise for tho deducing moral ill but from the indulgence of the will no passion not the love of pelf is really vicious in itself the noblest in the human breast motives to action but confessed however admired however approved from actual virtue far removed for a good heart as put to use or vice or virtue may produce a fertile soil where taking root plants good and bad bear equal fruit narcissa boasted once a mind the purest sure of human kind till growing passions taught her breast to feel for all that seemed distressed to melt in tenderness of grief and sigh to give unasked relief ah since by cruel arts betrayed how low is fallen the hapless maid too innocent to feel distrust or know how different love and lust now by her tempter even accused see her abandoned and abused her open heart her generous mind to prostitution how resigned of vices glorying in the shame her former self had

plainly hence of virtue is benevolence to mere good nature while you live no more that pompous title give the milk of kindness in a trice yielding the luscious cream of vice the milk of human kindness a florid term in common use for benevolence  the dryest eye the hardest heart may act as virtuous a part tho turned as adders deaf the ear to all that others feel or fear while vicious sloth a whining

or advice reply with looks as cold as ice with all the insolence of ease friend you know best do what you please may this not teach the hand profuse virtuous discretions sovereign use and thus a coldness of the heart a good to too much warmth impart how often less vicious is the mind that never beneficent or kind for others broke one moments rest nor cheered with comfort the distressed than his whose open hand and heart espouse the poor and needys part plunging in unforeseen distress hundreds in striving one to bless too short of sight benevolence proves often a breach of innocence to virtue therefore it is first required the man be strictly just passions the springs of joy and strife are but the elements of life and as rich streams from mountains flow smooth winding some through vales below while others raging as they come tear up their mothermountains womb or pouring down the hills amain deluge at once the humble plain so flow some passions gently mild while others furious bold and wild foaming over reasons rockbuilt mounds disdain the check of moral bounds but see in pastures streams of use when art corrects the floods abuse when their due channels taught to keep in shallow brook or river deep smiling through dappled meads they go and paint the flowers they cause to grow corrected thus by reasons art the bursts or meltings of the heart in virtues channels see them glide her flowers the blooming margins pride is the small spring thy favorite theme that trickles forth a shallow stream in murmurs soft a purling rill what will thou do to drive the mill how will thou make to ride at large thy timber or thy loaded barge as much as purling rills admired the navigable streams required the stream whose turbulence abides the roaring of the swelling tides alike whose raging bosom swells and back the threatening tide repels the hero thus the soldier brave it should seem that mr pope supposed heroism incompatible with virtue from the following lines in his essay on man  heroes are much the same the points agreed from macedonias madman to the swede the whole strange purpose of their lives to find or make an enemy of all mankind i will grant that many heroic actions have been achieved which have given just room for those who have no tincture of heroism in themselves to suppose the hero to be without either head or heart but however reprehensible the conduct of heroes may have been in general history may inform us that many of the distinguishing blessings mankind enjoy have been effected by those whom narrowminded moralists have stigmatized as knaves or madmen    how needful half the world to save like prussias king through seas of blood wading for threatened europes good virtuously useful to mankind the strongest as the weakest mind thus ones no better than the other the warmest heart the cold ones brother and neither this nor that in fact are virtuous till as such they act yet here appearances believed in virtuous actions often deceived how plain in the hypocritic face we read the characters of grace and falsely to youths giddy tribe designing villainy ascribe while time and circumstance and place our biased judgments here disgrace is there a man whose tender heart takes in anothers pains a part who clothes the naked feeds the poor and bribes the orphan to his door so kind he cannot bear to see another less at ease than he godlike benevolence you cry and praise his virtue to the sky but were this virtuous mortal poor obliged to beg from door to door could he not eat the bread at rest torn by the law from the distressed should his weak mind compunction feel in honest ways of trade to steal could not the softness of his heart torture the horse that draws the cart mangle the lamb before it die or draw its hearts blood through its eye who would not cry too proud to serve work idle wretch or work or starve to bridewells lash the knave consigned for vicious tenderness of mind is there who worn with vice begins to hide his multitude of sins leave of the wicked world does take and hermit turns for virtues sake or anxious for the souls of men flies to the pulpit or the pen behold another paul we cry a new apostle from on high are there whom cares nor want exclude at little cost from doing good in pious practices that spend their fortune and their latter end the sick who physic in distress and make the travlers burden less to these what virtue will refuse the praiseful elegiac muse but say does tenderness of heart teach the divines or doctors art too often unlettered preachers rave and damn the souls they meant to save too often alas the pious pill of charity like wards does kill while lightened more the pedlars pack to clothe our own than save his back whence then is virtue do thou cry in truth and nature i reply reason and passion both combined to form true virtue in the mind nor rests it there in mere design to go where these may chance to incline it is not sufficient to set out tho meaning well thy way in doubt here known experience should thou use that passion reason may not abuse cautious in virtues rout to go no farther than our path we know lest when through ignorance lost our way passion to vice should lead astray it is not enough to mean aright unless the meant effects in sight too apt to wander from the mark when blundring forward in the dark it is no excuse to have it said the heart had put it in the head when mischief done instead of good for want of being understood to virtue pitiful our claim when at a venture taking aim more by good luck than sense or wit the mark of moral good we hit what virtues in the madmans dream or fools impracticable scheme whose should they even succeed at best chancemedley virtue is confessed knowledge my friend goes hence it is plain foremost in virtues splendid train while reason and the passions joined walk closely hand in hand behind is it said one mere goodnatured deed all worth in science does exceed one moral or a mere wellnaturd deed can all desert in sciences exceed duke of buckingham  on this weak maxim do object we virtuous merit here neglect thus honest ignorance to contemn and inability condemn say thou as no foreknowledge given events are in the hands of heaven and therefore virtuous those confessed from what they know who act the best lorenzo no  unless it is shown that such no better might have known it is true as individuals here are placed in natures proper sphere their knowledge more or less complete as genius and instruction meet man by no seraphs rapture fired virtues as knowledge given required but think not thou that bounteous heaven has barren understanding given has talents lent which unapplied it is virtuous in the earth to hide no  with the power of reason blessed improvements claimed as interest is there who turns away his ear instructions voice averse to hear most obstinately bent to plod along the road his father trod old custom never to forsake nor use of eye or ear to make tho right the wilful wretch we find is his a virtuous turn of mind with god above or man below how is it deserving not to know of virtues merit folly hush nor put true wisdom to the blush remember virtue still depends both on our motives and our ends what merit is it we gladly do that which our hearts incline us to or what that reason does submit to own the truth is right and fit for say that by the heart or head solely to virtue men were led if by the heart and that alone what man ever called his heart his own right often by impulse forced to go whether his reason lead or no apparently against the will as often conducting him to ill how meritorious then the best that love or pity warms the breast for this nor that from vice can save or if they could  it is god that gave is it from caution practiced long you seek the right and shun the wrong by just experience understood your worldly interests to be good what merits here the clod of earth that nature smiled upon its birth and gave it reasons fostring aid to teach it virtue as its trade say thou when head and heart we prais does this not virtues merit raise the man of vicious acts ashamed  may yet for spiritual pride be blamed the elegantly just  too nice perhaps for vulgar scenes of vice the lowlyminded kind and meek  mean pitiful perhaps and weak the patriot in his countrys cause  a gudgeon greedy of applause the pious who their god revere  only perhaps of hell in fear or not by fears sufficient driven pushed forward by the hopes of heaven so little do we truly know the cause to which we virtue owe to what bad principle or good even we ourselves have vice withstood nor can the best of mortals say from what has yet directed may or in a state he never knew tell what his head and heart might do who then their moral worth shall prize shall even the best the worst despise thin the partitions that divide even vice itself from virtues pride the virtuous boaster weak and proud like the tall idiot in the crowd who stalking with exalted tread above his fellows rears his head while from his more distinguished height the harm upon his pate does light the pride of virtue hence depressed o learn to pity not detest even looking with a brothers eye on wretches doomed by law to die to heaven that has the difference made tween thee and them the honor paid the object more of pity sure the vicious mind no leach can cure than such whose mere corporeal part diseased admits the doctors art nay if by virtue understood the act producing moral good and moral good and evil known by sense of physical

on a time how long ago perhaps chronologists may know on a wide lake far north and cold a race of beavers kept their hold their island cabbins duly stored and feasted at a plenteous board to industry and labor bred meanwhile they toiled as well as fed nor waited their decreasing store to fail ere provident of more continual plenty hence by stealth grew up to luxury and wealth when now alas in evil hour to wealth succeeds the thirst of power no longer satisfied to reign sole masters of the watery main to see the trembling otter fly hereditary enemy condemned tho starving on the shore to trespass on the lake no more contented not that nature gave the spoils and triumphs of the wave but vainly fond to show their might or turn out champions for the right they interfere in all disputes between the continental brutes and parties in their feuds to make their island tenements forsake transporting madly brutes and stores blind war to wage on foreign shores and save from otters bears and cats landbeavers vile or worthless rats meanwhile at home is various ways their wealths consumed their strength decays recruits and payment of allies demand exorbitant supplies while even by battles fought and gained their little state is only drained sagacious creatures shall we call the brutes that squander thus their all or shall we not their wit deride who thus expose their weakest side but time and circumstance you say may change the face of things  they may yet neither sure can change the nature of brutal more than human creature and yet as if some revolution had happened in his constitution thus often the beaver leaves his home on mountain wilds for wars to roam unnatural wars to him at least amphibious moistureloving beast in which a generous jack with pride he always takes the weakest side and hires the poor at his expense to stand up in their own defense while ten to one he trusts the gods to him are even trifling odds as if to win his surest way was still to choose the losing play or loggerheads he took delight in and fought but for the sake of fighting yet beavers are accounted wise and need no burdensome allies their hold in liquid walls immured from danger and assaults secured alas dame nature surely meant each creature for its element if birds will dive and fishes fly what wonder if they droop and die now so it happd as poets sing a landrat was the beavers king by all beloved without dispute a just humane and honest brute who yet throughout his gracious reign too highly prized his old domain too poor too weak without allies to stand amidst its enemies and therefore at their own expense the beavers purchased its defense or when by chance of war twas lost redeemed it always at their cost bribing the tigers bears and cats with subsidies to spare the rats and keeping in their constant pay the bandogs not to prowl that way now on a day it so fell out the landed brutes began their rout a cat of catamountain race spit in the lordly tygers face and aided by a wild shebear in pieces vowed his limbs to tear the tiger bravely bid defiance and claimed the beaverkings alliance meanwhile the otters joined the cats and wreakd their vengeance on the rats a vengeance they were urged to take for what they suffered on the lake where now their fishing haunts were gone and holds all ruined one by one and not an otter dared to dive or daring reached the shore alive so powerful were the beavers grown while conquest made the lake their own vain conquest if constrained at last to sully all their glory past by giving back each dearbought prize to save their poor or weak allies who now by numerous foes enthralled aloud for their assistance called the beavers readily consenting to do what done they are sure repenting and yet alas twas all in vain the patriots ventured to complain twas all in vain to represent the stores immense they yearly spent how much they owed and to their sorrow how much they still were forced to borrow in vain they showed the end they sought when against the otters first they fought by almost every battle gained at length completely was obtained and therefore having got their end they need no longer to contend but standing on their own defense might now contract the wars expense and would the foe accept of peace exact a general release or sparing thus their blood and treasure might leave him to make peace at leisure remonstrance just but twas in vain success had turned each beavers brain the tygers martial fame and fire did all their heated breasts inspire and every honest plodding beaver seized with a military fever careless of what was done or doing ran fightingmad the road to ruin nay even the chief who once more loud than any of the patriot crowd roared out his insolent reflections on the great rat and his connections a ministerial beaver grown now bowed obedient to the throne and worse than either of the brothers adopted measures damned in others measures himself condemned so late as big with ruin to the state yet now he swallowed all the objections he made before to land connections the tygers call the rats distress demanded instantly redress and generous brutes should sacrifice themselves their all for their allies how much unlike this specious cant to all his former noisy rant to that fine florid declamation by which he used to gull the nation but as the mob had been so loud to praise this idol of the crowd his friends were now ashamed to own their honest chief had changed his tone and let him lead them by the snout as tho he never had turned about meanwhile with grief the patriot few who best the beavers interest knew saw him on every flight pretense abuse the public confidence and enter into every measure contrived to squander blood and treasure beheld the waste of both increase to purchase war instead of peace while more their toil and less their gain how just a reason to complain the fruits of all their labor thrown away in quarrels not their own

an exclusive right to bring their mental progeny to light this rights invaded by the party peachd who vi et armis has the old bard oerreachd by counterfeiting of his hand do you see feloniously to set these vagrants free with base design tadopt them for his own though shakespeares property and his alone such is the fact  a critic were an ass no doubt to let such imposition pass nor could a cheat so palpable succeed but that the captain of the guard could not read  not he for laughing though to have saved his soul the scene and circumstances were so droll pistol with yellow nightcap patched with

mrs h enters reading a card the muse of shakespeares compliments  a card texcuse this evenings enterprizing bard great his presumption to confess the truth but as he pleads the passion of his youth together with the magic of her charms attracting him resistless to her arms though somewhat by surprise she owns she suffered yet as no actual violence was offered she is willing if the audience should agree for this one time to set the offender free we women soon forgive if not forget the crimes our beauties make the men commit especially when once we are past our prime and shakespeares muse like me s the worse for time for though she charm with fancy ever young tho heavenly music dwell upon her tongue lost many an artless smile and dimple sleek which sat alluring on her virgin cheek beauties that faded on the gazers eye and no coldcream of comment can supply as for what mercry in the prologue told ye pray let not that from clemency withold ye that hermes was of old a lying blade and practiced in imposture as his trade the patron he or classic lore deceives of cheats forestallers higglers hucksters thieves besides  to tell you a stagetrick of ours  but you will not spread the secret out of doors  the man was no more mercury than i am queen hecuba the wife of trojan priam a messenger from phoebus he a god i can assure you all twas mr dodd his dropping from the clouds was all a sham and his pretended errand but a flam we have heathen gods of pasteboard made to fly on hempen cords across the painted sky those canvass clouds that dangle there above inveloping the throne itself of jove his tale fictitious too though told so glib for take it on my word twas all a fib old falstaff in elysium  to my thinking so great his natural tendency to sinking that to the shades if he had once descended to bring him back not atlas had pretended dramatic sprites at least they tell me so dwell not with saints above nor devils below but formed the imagination to engage during their shortlived passage over the stage as mere ideal characters exist and stand as ciphers marked on natures list to genius given a delegated power to form these transient beings of an hour which from this mimic world whenever they go are free to range in fancys pimlico a limbo large and broad which in the schools is called by some the paradise of fools ferae naturae there their preservation is purchased by no game association the poaching plagiary alone denied a privilege granted to each bard beside who though a cottager to try his skill may shoot or course or hunt them down at will in his own paddock may the strays receive and scorn to ask a lordly owners leave not but that here the author of the play by me begs leave submissively to say none more than he reveres great shakespeares name or glows with zeal to vindicate his fame an epistle dedicatory to the first minister of state for the time being prefixed to the second edition of epistles to lorenzo hail mighty pam if song without offense thus hail the first courtcard in eminence thou in whom kings find often the sovereign sway for kings at loo the leading knave obey or if content to play an humbler game plain jack we style thee more familiar name thou whose sly blows the lower party feels while bent the high to catch thy tripping heels great in thyself whatever thou art called nations by thee enfranchised or inthralld hollad to day to palaceyard along flattered at once in metzotint and song or piqud perhaps while chimes the present line ere yet turned out as usual to resign branded by the honest satire of the times with all a ministers mysterious crimes to thee i pay my  till in disgrace and then as humbly to the next in place for know what private worth soever thy boast thy person i address not but thy post is there a time when statesmen good or great look down with pity on the toils of state superior to the boast of boasted things the pomp of titles and the smile of kings when in the private hour of social ease ambition sleeps and truth itself may please at such an hour when even politeness deigns to taste the rudeness of familiar strains presuming thou in honor to the muse indulgent once her labors may peruse to thee those honest labors she commends at court while honest doubtless finding friends but through thy levee if forbid to press in freedoms plain and anticourtiers dress light of her rhimes as of petitions made should they be lost forgotten or mislaid if not so vain to think thou should commend in either case permit me to defend too well i know imputed as a crime the gift of reason to the man of rhyme to childish fiction jingling numbers tied as bells that dangle by an infants side to useless whims poetic worth confined to please the sense but not improve the mind should on my daring verse then censure fall from priest or prelate wakened in the stall or should the learned jurors take in hand to burn the books they may not understand scorned the loud torrent of the mobs abuse with thee i leave my error and excuse know then my patron once upon a time while yet a boy i caught the itch of rhyme but born with hatred to the singsong train whose numbers charm like senseless notes in vain while strange to themes temploy the muse about the peccant humor broke but little out till late in waking dreams that trouble youth on one side prudence urged on the other truth prudence a worldlyminded dame and sly who fixed on earth still kept her cautious eye while truth whose open breast did mine inflame looked up to heaven to heaven from whence she came when now my eager heart her power confessed and thus her willing captive she addressed art thou my friend that enterprizing youth who make pretensions to the song of truth by reason taught to leave in early life the wanton mistress for the faithful wife among the sciences thy partner choose philosophys the sister of the muse prudence who heard made various hems and haws and after due deliberating pause shaking her head beware rash youth she cried let prudence here your early footsteps guide art thou so ignorant as not to know truth leads us often to poverty and woe let me advise  would thou succeed in rhyme mark at the proper season well thy time taking this maxim as a general rule the knave is honest till he plays the fool for times there are of such malignant face that sharpers only rise to power and place times when the mere huzza for public good breaks down all ranks of honor and of blood when sacred characters like bawds are used and princes with impunity abused the throne of majesty a vulgar thing while george the cobbler damns great george the king in times like these behold on every side what pains we take offensive truth to hide ashamed to show her bashful face at court see her simplicity but made its sport her lovers stigmatized by general hate as bold disturbers of the church and state would thou to this abandoned tribe belong what bard ever heeded yet the truth of song again it is certain there may come a time when impudence finds no excuse in rhyme when even prudence may herself be just her interest more to keep than break her trust when crowns are honored and in proper season s  dread patriot may be hanged for treason a time perhaps years work the strangest things when the brave scots may love their best of kings when slighted science may approach the throne and britons make true policy their own what tho their patriot hearts are known to fail when dearth of barley threatens want of ale what tho religion armed by commonsense breaks but its weapons in its own defense even yet may piety be kept alive and halfexpiring patriotism revive at such a season should the muse inspire if touched with caution thou may strike the lyre perhaps uncensurd but to look for praise know these young bard are no poetic days but should the age as probably it may turn its loose politics another way while in religious mood far pushed the schemes of true born britons always in extremes the times may yet return when frantic zeal shall give its wooden sword an edge of steel when convocation shall in judgment sit to canvass the infidelity of wit on wicked knowledge britains guilt to lay and drive the destined victim far away if thus blind ignorance should rule in turn bards loose their ears and martyr theists burn ready reforming constables at hand of scientific vice to cleanse the land have thou with truth nor morals ought to do things are not always fit that may be true here prudence ended  her advice was good but truth has charms that cannot be withstood hers then the muse  how far success will show in times like ours her song be apropos so much indeed of prudence did i learn my fingers never in politics to burn silent i sat amidst the party rout when late the ministry turned in and out when raged the furious goosequills of the times to shame their country with their shameless rhimes careless what turtleeating son of whites might set the blunders of the state to rights if pollio gallus tully or his grace should all keep out or who get into place i cared not i tho these or none of these the king the house or mightier mob might please blamed i the peer whom adverse winds had blown round the wide world to prop a monarchs throne taught in the hurricanes of southern seas the statesmans wisdom and the courtiers case by plundered spaniards the consummate skill to steer a kingdom like a bark at will tho made too plain the leeway of the realm did i presume to bid him mind the helm nay when the guardian genii of the land to save our desperate fortunes took in hand i sung them not tho crowned by half the nation with civic wreaths from town and corporation i never officious cracked my brains tamend errors the great alone might comprehend plagued with no songs of praise our lord the king nor gave one faggot to the blaze of byng but free from panegyric as abuse put all my little wit to private use thus far of tempral politics i am clear nor has the spiritual had more to fear since gospel witnesses in form were tried their valid evidence i never denied never intermeddled with the jurys quest nor contradicted littleton or west when church and state learned warburton would join tho sad the affair i made it none of mine nor did i ever against lelands pen presume to vindicate lord bolingbroke or hume made no pretense to freedom of debate nor riskd like harmless annet woolstons fate and tho for once in this a trick of youth prudential views are sacrificed to truth could i shake off those vices rhyme and sense my first might likely prove my last offense or in thy cause enlisted once my pen i never more might trouble truth again but to thy purpose turn my ready hand true to the law and gospel of the land the end
