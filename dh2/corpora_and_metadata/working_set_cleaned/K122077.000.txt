enough to be suspicious of every body   san and yet methinks sir you should leave me out   car it may be so i cannot tell but i am not at ease if they dont make a knave at least they will make a fool of thee   san i dont believe a word on it but good faith master your love makes somewhat of you i dont know what it is but methinks when you suspect me you dont seem  man of half those parts i used to take you for look i my face it is round and comely not one hollow line of  villain in it men of my fabric dont use to be suspecte for knaves and when you take us for fools we never tak you for wise men for my part in this present case i tak myself to be mighty deep a standerby sir sees more than a gamester you are pleased to be jealous of your poo mistress without a cause she uses you but too well in my humble opinion she sees you and talks with you till i am quite tired on it sometimes and your rival that you are so scared about forces a visit upon her about once in a fortnight   car alas thou art ignorant in these affairs he that is the civillst received is often the least cared for women appear warm to one to hide a flame for another lorenzo in short appears too composed of late to be a rejected lover and the indifference he shows upon the favors i seem to receive from her poisons the pleasure i else should taste in them and keeps me upon a perpetual rack no  i would fain see some of his jealous transports have him fire at the sight of me contradict me whenever i speak affront me wherever he meets me challenge me fight me    san  run you through the guts   car but he is too calm his hearts too much at ease to leave me mine at rest   san for my part master i am not so great a philosopher as you be nor thank my stars so bitter a lover but what i see  that i generally believe and when jacinta tells me she loves me dearly i have good thoughts enough of my person never to doubt the truth on it see here the baggage comes   enter jacinta with a letter hist jacinta my dear   jacin who is that blunderbuss where is your master   san hard by   showing him jacin o sir i am glad i have found you at last i believe i have traveled five miles after you and could neither find you at home nor in the walks nor at church nor at the opera nor    san nor any where else where he was not to be found if you had looked for him where he was twas ten to one but you had met with him   jacin i had jackadandy   car but prithee what is the matter who sent you after me   jac one who is never well but when she sees you i think twas my lady   car dear jacinta i fain would flatter myself but am not able the blessings too great to be my lot yet it is not well to trifle with me how short soever i am in other merit the tenderness i have for leonora claims something from her generosity i should not be deluded   jacin and why do you think you are methinks she is pretty well above board with you what must be done more to satisfy you   san why lorenzo must hang himself and then we are content   jacin how lorenzo   san if less will do he will tell you   jacin why you are not mad sir are you jealous of him pray which way may this have got into your head i took you for a man of sense before  is this your doings log   to sancho san no forsooth pert i am not much given to suspicion as you can tell mrs forward  if i were i might find more cause i guess than your mistress has given our master here but i have so many pretty thoughts of my own person housewife more than i have of yours that i stand in dread of no man   jacin that is the way to prosper however so far i will confess the truth to thee at least if that dont do nothing else will men are mighty simple in lovematters sir when you suspect a womans falling off you fall a plaguing her to bring her on again attack her with reason and a sour face udslife sir attack her with a fiddle double your good humor  give her a ball  powder your periwig at her  let her cheat you at cards a little and i will warrant all is right again   car say no more i have been to blame but there shall be no more on it   jacin i should punish you but justly however for what is past if i carried back what i have brought you but i am good natured so here it is open it and see how wrong you timed your jealousy   car reads if you love me with that tenderness you have made me long believe you do this letter will be welcome it is to tell you you have leave to plead a daughters weakness to a fathers indulgence and if you prevail with him to lay his commands upon me you shall be as happy as my obedience to them can make you  leonora   then i shall be what man was never yet kissing the letter ten thousand blessings on thee for thy news i could adore thee as a deity   embracing jacinta san true flesh and blood every inch of her for all that   car reads again and if you prevail with him to lay his commands upon me you shall be as happy as my obedience to them can make you o haypy happy carlos but what shall i say to thee for this welcome message  to jacinta alas i want words  but let this speak for me and this and this and    giving her his ring watch and purse san hold sir pray leave a little something for our boardwages you cannot carry them all i believe  to jacinta shall i ease thee of this   offering to take the purse jacin no but you may carry  that sirrah   giving him a box of the ear san the jades grown purseproud already   car well dear jacinta say something to your charming mistress that i am not able to say myself but above all excuse my late unpardonable folly and offer her my life to expiate my crime   jacin the best plea for pardon will be never to repeat the fault   car if that will do it is sealed for ever   jacin enough but i must be gone success attend you with the old gentleman goodby to ye sir   exit jacin car eternal blessings follow thee   san i think she has taken them all with her the jade has got her apron full   car is not that lorenzos man coming this way

housewife so master and i are going to match ourselves elsewhere   lop but is it possible sir your honor should be in earnest i am afraid youre pleased to be merry with your poor humble servant   car i am not at present much disposed to mirth my indifference in this matter is not so thoroughly foemd but my reason has so far mastered my passion to show me it is in vain to pursue a woman whose heart is already anothers it is what i have so plainly seen of late i have roused my resolution to my aid and broke my chains for ever   lop well sir to be plain with you this is the joyfullest news i have heard this long time for i always knew you to be a mighty honest gentleman and good faith it often went to the heart of me to see you so abused dear dear have i often said to myself when they have had a private meeting just after you have been gone    car ha   san hold master dont kill him yet   to car aside lop i say i have said to myself what wicked things are women and what pity it is they should be suffered in a christian country what a shame they should be allowed to play willinthewisp with men of honor and lead them through thorns and briars and rocks and rugged ways till their hearts are torn in pieces like an old coat in a foxchace i say i have said to myself    car thou have said enough to thyself but say a little more to me where were these secret meetings thou talk of   lop in sundry places and by diverse ways sometimes in the cellar sometimes in the garret sometimes in the court sometimes in the gutter but the place where the kiss of kisses was given was    car in

lopez i am to blame to speak thus harshly to thee let this obtain thy pardon gives him money thou see i am disturbed   lop yes sir i see i have been led into a snare i have said too much   car and yet thou must say more nothing can lessen my torment but a farther knowledge of what causes my misery speak then have i any thing to hope   lop nothing but that you may be a happier bachelor than my master may probably be a married man   car married say thou   lop i did sir and i believe he will say so too in a twelvemonth   car o torment  but give me more on it when now to who where   lop

base news master   car now my insulting rivals smile speaks out o cursed cursed women   enter jacinta jacin i am come in haste to tell you sir that as soon as the moons up my lady will give you a meeting in the closewalk by the backdoor of the garden she thinks she has something to propose to you will certainly get her fathers consent to marry you   car past sufferance this aggravation is not to be borne go thank her  with my curses fly  and let them blast her while their venoms strong   exit car jacin  will not thou explain what is this storm for   san and dare thou ask me questions smoothfaced iniquity crocodile of nile siren of the rocks go carry back the too gentle answer thou have received only let me add with the poet  we are no fools trollop my master nor me and thy mistress may go  to the devil with thee  exit sancho jacinta sola am i awake  i fancy not a very idle dream this well i will go talk in my sleep to my lady about it and when i awake well try what interpretation we can make on it   act ii enter leonora and jacinta jancin you see me as much enraged at it as you are yourself yet my brain is roving after the cause for something there must be never letter was received by man with more passion and transport i was almost as charming a goddess as yourself only for bringing it yet when in a moment after i come with a message worth a dozen on it never was witch so handled something must have passed between one and the other that is sure   leo nothing could pass worth my enquiring after since nothing could happen that can excuse his usage of me he had a letter under my hand which owned him master of my heart and till i contradicted it with my mouth he ought not to doubt the truth on it   jacin nay i confess madam i hant a word to say for him i am afraid he is but a rogue at bottom as well as my shameless that attends him we are bit by my troth and happily well enough served for listening to the glib tongues of the rascals   leo well let him laugh let him glory in what he has done he shall see i have a spirit can use him as i ought   jacin and let one thing be your comfort by the way madam that in spite of all your dear affections to him you have had the grace to keep him at arms end you have not thanked me for it but good faith twas well i did not stir out of the chamber that fond night for there are times the stoutest of us are in danger the rascals wheedle so   leo in short my very soul is sird with this treatment and if ever that perfidious monster should relent though he should crawl like a poor worm beneath my feet nay plunge a dagger in his heart to bleed for pardon i charge thee strictly charge thee on thy life thou do not urge a look to melt me toward him but strongly buy me up in brave resentment and if thou see which heavens avert a glance of weakness in me rouse to my memory the vile wrongs i have born and blazon them with skill in all their glaring colors   jacin madam never doubt me i am charged to the mouth with fury and if ever i meet that traitor of mine such a volly will i pour about his ears  now heaven prevent all hasty vows but in the humor i am methinks i would carry my maidenhead to my cold grave with me before i would let it simper at the rascal but come come madam well be revenged on them never fear   exeunt enter don carlos and sancho car repulsed again this is not to be borne what though this villains story be a falsehood was i to blame to hearken to it this usage cannot be supported how was it she treated thee   san never was ambassado worse received madam my master asks ten thousand pardons and humbly begs one moments interview  be gone you rascal you madam what answer shall i give my master  tell him he is a villain indeed fair lady i think this is hasty treatment  here my footmen toss me this fellow out at the window and away she went to her devotions   car did you see jacinta   san yes she saluted me with halfascore rogues and rascals too i think our destinies are much alike sir and of my conscience a couple of scurvy jades we are hampered with   car ungrateful women to receive with such contempt so quick a return of a heart so justly alarmed   san ha ha ha   car what no allowance to be made to the first transports of a lovers fury when roused by so dreadful an appearance as just as my suspicions were have i long suffered them to arraign her   san no   car have i waited for oaths or imprecations to clear her   san no   car nay even now is not the whole world still in suspense about her whilst i alone conclude her innocent   san it is very true   car she might methinks through this profound respect observe a flame another would have cherished she might support me against groundless fears and save me from a rivals tyranny she might release me from these cruel racks and would no doubt if she could love as i do   san ha ha ha   car but since she dont what do i whining here curse on the base humilities of love   san right   car let children kiss the rod that fleas them let dogs lie down and lick the shoe that spurns them   san ay   car i am a man by nature meant for power the scepters given us to wield and we betray our trust whenever we meanly lay it at a womans feet   san true we are men boo  come master let us both be in a passion here is my scepter showing a cudgel subject jacinta look about you sir was you evr in muscovy the women there love the men dearly why because  shaking his stick there is your lovepowder for you ah sir were we but wise and stout what work should we make with them but this humble love making spoils them all a rare way indeed to bring matters about with them we are persuading them all day they are angels and goddesies in order to use them at night like human creatures we are like to succeed truly   car for my part i never yet could bear a slight from any thing nor will i now there is but one way however to resent it from a woman and that is to drive her bravely from your heart and place a worthier in her vacant throne   san now with submission to my betters i have another way sir i will drive my tyrant from my heart and place myself in her throne yes i will be lord of my own tenement and keep my household in order would you would do so too master for look you i have been servitour in a college at salamancha and read philosophy with the doctors where i found that a woman in all times has been observed to be an animal hard to understand and much inclined to mischief now as an animal is always an animal and a captain always a captain so a woman is always a woman whence it is that a certain greek says her head is like a bank of sand or as another a solid rock or according to a third a dark lanthorn pray sir observe for this is close reasoning and so as the head is the head of the body and that the body without a head is like a head without a tail and that where there is neither head nor tail it is a very strange body so i say a woman is by comparison do you see for nothing explains things like comparisons i say by comparison as aristotle has often said before me one may compare her to the raging sea for as the sea when the wind rises knits its brows like an angry bull and that waves mount upon rocks and rocks mount upon waves that porpusses leap like trouts and whales skip about like gudgeons that ships roll like beer barrels and mariners pray like saints just so i say a woman  a woman i say just so when her reason is shipwrecked upon her passion and the hulk of her understanding lies thump thump thumping against the rock of her fury then it is i say that by certain immotions which  um  cause as one may suppose a sort of convulsive  yes  hurricanious  um  like  in short a woman is like the devil but here come the crocodiles to weep us into mercy   enter leonora and jacinta master let us show ourselves men and leave their briny tears to wash their dirty faces   car it is not in the power of charms to move me   san nor me i hope and yet i fear those eyes will ook out sharp to snatch up such a prize   pointing to jacinta jacin he is coming to us madam to beg pardon but sure you will never grant it him   leo if i do may heaven never grant me mine   jacin that is brave   car you look madam upon me as if you thought i came to trouble you with my usual importunities i will ease you of that pain by telling you my business now is calmly to assure you but i assure it you with heaven and hell for seconds for may the joys of one fly from me whilst the pains of the other overtake me if all your charms displayed ever shake my resolution i will never see you more   san bon   leo you are a man of that nice honor sir i know you will keep your word i expected this assurance from you and came this way only to thank you for it   jacin very well   car you did imperious dame you did how base is womans pride how wretched are the ingredients it is formed of if you saw cause for just disdain why did you not at first repulse me why lead a slave in chains that could not grace your triumphs if i am thus to be contemned think on the favors you have done the wretch and hide your face for ever   san well argued   leo i own you have hit the only fault the world can charge me with the favors i have done to you i am indeed ashamed of but since women have their frailties you will allow me mine   car it is well extremely well madam i am happy however you at last speak frankly i thank you for it from my soul i thank you but dont expect me greveling at your feet again dont for if i do    leo you will be treated as you deserve trod upon   car give me patience  but i dont want it i am calm madam farewell be happy if you can by heavens i wish you so but never spread your net for me again for if you do    leo you will be running into it   car rather run headlong into fire and flames rather be torn with pincers bit from bit  but i am wrong this sounds like passion and heaven can tell i am not angry madam i think we have no farther business together your most humble servant   leo farewell to ye sir   car come along   to sancho goes to the scene and returns yet once more before i go lest you should doubt my resolution may i starve perish rot be blasted dead damned or any other thing that men or gods can think on if on any occasion whatever civil or military pleasure or business love or hate or any other accident of life i from this moment change one word or look with you   going off sancho clap him upon the back leo content come away jacinta   carlos returns car yet one word madam if you please i have a little thing here belongs to you a foolish bawble i once was fond of twitching her picture from his breast will you accept a trifle from your servant   leo willingly sir i have a bawble too i think you have some claim to you will wear it for my sake   breaks a bracelet from her arm and gives it him car most thankfully this too i should restore you if once was yours   giving her a table book by your favor madam  there is a line or two in it i think you did me once the honor to write with your own fair hand here it is  reads you love me carlos and would know the secret movements of my heart whether i give you mine or no with yours methinks i would never never part thus you have encouraged me and thus you have deceived me   san very true   leo i have some faithful lines too i think i can produce em   pulls out a table book reads and then gives it him how long soever to sigh in vain my destiny may prove my fate in spite of your disdain will let me glory in your chain and give me leave eternally to love there sir take your poetry again   throwing it at his feet it is not much the worse for my wearing till serve again upon a fresh occasion   jacin well done   car i believe i can return the present madam with  a pocket full of your prose  there    throwing a handful of letters at her feet leo jacinta give me his letters there sir not to be behind hand with you   takes a handful of his letters out of a box and throws them in his face jacin and there and there and there sir   jacinta throws the rest at him san cods my life we want ammunition but for a hift  there and there you saucy slut you   sancho pulls a pack of dirty cards out of his pocket and throws em at her then they close he pulls off her headcloaths and she his wig and then part she running to her mistress he to his master jacin i think madam we have clearly the better on it   leo for a proof i resolve to keep the field   jacin have a care he dont rally and beat you yet though pray walk off   leo fear nothing   san how the armies stand and gaze at one another after the battle what think you sir of showing yourself a great general by making an honorable retreat   car i scorn it   san sir   car i scorn it   san oh   car oh leonora leonora a heart like mine should not be treated thus   leo carlos carlos i have not deserved this usage   car barbarous leonora but it is useless to reproach you she that is capable of what you have done is formed too cruel ever to repent of it go on then tyrant make your bliss complete torment me still for still alas i love enough to be tormented   leo ah carlos little do you know the tender movements of that thing you name the heart where love presides admits no thought against the honor of its ruler   car it is not to call that honor into doubt if conscious of our own unworthiness we interpret every frown to our destruction   leo when jealousy proceeds from such humble apprehensions it shows itself with more respect than yours has done   car and where a heart is guiltless it easily forgives a greater crime   leo forgiveness is not now in our debate if both have been in fault it is fit that both should suffer for it our separation will do justice on us   car but since we are ourselves the judges of our crimes what if we should inflict a gentler punishment   leo twould but encourage us to sin again   car and if it should    leo twould give a fresh occasion for the pleasing exercise of mercy   car right and so we act the part of earth and heaven together of men and gods and taste of both their pleasures   leo the banquets too inviting to refuse it   car then thus let us fall on and feed upon it for ever   carries her off embracring her and kissing her hand jacin ah woman foolish foolish woman   san very foolish indeed   jacin but dont expect i will follow her example   san you would mopsy if i would let you   jacin i would sooner tear my eyes out ah  that she had a little of my spirit in her   san i believe i shall sind thou have a great deal of her flesh my charmer but twont do i am all rock hard rock very marble   jacin a very pumicestone you rascal you if one would try thee but to prevent thy humilities and show thee all submission would be in vain to convince thee thou have nothing but misery and despair before thee here  take back thy paultry thimble and be in my debt for the shirts i have made thee with it   san nay if yre at that port mistress i believe i shall lose nothing by the balance of thy presents there take thy tobaccostopper and stop thy    jacin here  take thy satin pincushion with thy curious half hundred of pins in it thou made such a vapouring about yesterday tell them carefully there is not one wanting   san there is thy ivoryhasted knife again whet it well it is so blunt twill cut nothing but love   jacin and there is thy pretty pocket scissars thou have honored me with they will cut off a leg or an arm heaven bless them   san here is the enchanted handkerchief you were pleased to endear with your precious blood when the violence of your love at dinner the other day made you cut your fingers  there   blows his nose in it and gives it her jacin the rascal so provokes me i will not even keep his paultry garters from him do you see these you pitiful beggarly scoundrel you  there take em there   she takes her garters off and flaps them about his face san i have but one thing more of thine showing his cudgel i own it is the top of all thy presents and might be useful to me but that thou may have nothing to upbraid me with even take it again with the rest of them   lifting it up to strike her she leaps about his neck jacin ah cruel sancho  now beat me sancho do   san rather like indian beggars beat my precious self rather let infants blood about the streets rather let all the wine about the cellar rather let  oh jacinta  thou have overcome throws away his stick and embraces her how foolish are the great resolves of man resolves which we neither would keep nor can when those bright eyes in kindness please to shine their goodness i must needs return with mine bless my jacinta in her sanchos arms   jacin and i my sancho with jacintas charms   exeunt finis
