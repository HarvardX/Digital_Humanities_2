the beauties of stern including all his pathetic tales and most distinguished observations on life selected for the heart of sensibility  dear sensibility source inexhausted of all that is precious in our joys or costly in our sorrows thou chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of straw  and it is thou who lifts him up to heaven  eternal fountain of our feelings it is here i trace thee sen journey p     a new edition  london printed for t davies russel street covent garden j ridley st jamessstreet w flexney holborn j sewel cornhill and g kearsley fleet street        to his imperial majesty joseph the second emperor of germany sir when i compiled this little volume from the writings of one of the first ornaments of britain and of human genius i did not look out long for a protector for the inestimable treasure to whom said all the powers of feeling kindling within me  to whom should these pages that breathe the spirit of humanity in such a supereminent degree be addressed but to that illustrious monarch whose benignity and unparalelled philanthropy has given a charm to every enlightened quarter of the universe  when your majesty retires from the busy scenes of royalty to commune with nature and her eminent works of which study your distinguished actions speak you an admirable proficient this volume will prove itself an entertaining and excellent companion  i rejoice in this opportunity of testifying my respect for such transcendent goodness and believe me to be with the most profound zeal  sir your majestys most obedient and most devoted humble servant w h london feb         preface a selection of the beauties of stern is what has been looked for by a number of his admirers for some time well knowing they would form such a volume as perhaps this nor any other language could equal indeed it was highly necessary on a particular score to make this selection the chaste lovers of literature were not only deprived themselves of the pleasure and instruction so conspicuous in this magnificent assemblage of genius but their rising offspring whose minds it would polish to the highest perfection were prevented from tasting the enjoyment likewise the chaste part of the world complained so loudly of the obscenity which taints the writings of stern and indeed with some reason that those readers under their immediate inspection were not suffered to penetrate beyond the title page of his tristram shandy  his sentimental journey in some degree escaped the general censure though that is not entirely free of the fault complained of  to accommodate those who are strangers to the first of these works i have i hope with some degree of judgment extracted the most distinguished passages on which the sun of genius shines so resplendent that all his competitors in his manner of writing are lost in an eclipse of affectation and unnatural rhapsody i intended to have arranged them alphabetically till i found the stories of le fever the monk and maria would be too closely connected for the feeling reader and would wound the bosom of sensibility too deeply i therefore placed them at a proper distance from each other  i need not explain my motive for introducing the sermon on the abuses of conscience with the effusions of humanity throughout it every parent and governor i believe unless a bigoted papist will thank me  i wish i could insuse the pleasure that attended me in compiling this little work into the breast of the reader yet unacquainted with stern  as it is i promise him the hours he may devote to this great master of nature and the passions will be marked with more felicity than any since genius led him to the love of letters  the authors opinion of many parts of the sacred writings may with truth be applied to a great part of his own that there is to be found in them sublime and noble passages which by the rules of sound criticism and reason may be demonstrated to be truly eloquent and beautiful  there is something in them so thoroughly affecting and so noble and sublime withal that one might challenge the writings of the most celebrated orators of antiquity to produce any thing like them  before i conclude i cannot help observing with an excellent writer that there are minds upon which the rays of fancy may be pointed without effect and which no fire of sentiment can agitate or exalt  may such minds never violate the beanties of stern but let them be while the virtues find sanctuary in the hearts of the amiable  their amusement only  w h  contents a the ass page    the dead ass page     humouring immoral appetites

the beauties of stern the preceptor you see it is high time said my father addressing himself equally to my uncle toby and yorick to take this young creature out of these womens hands and put him into those of a private governor  now as i consider the person who is to be about my son as the mirror in which he is to view himself from morning to night and by which he is to adjust his looks his carriage and perhaps the inmost sentiments of his heart  i would have one yorick if possible polished at all points fit for my child to look into  there is continued my father a certain mien and motion of the body and all its parts both in acting and speaking which argues a man well within there are a thousand unnoticed openings continued my father which let a penetrating eye at once into a mans soul and i maintain it added he that a man of sense does not lay down his hat in coming into a room  or take it up in going out of it but something escapes which discovers him  i will have him continued my father cheerful facete jovial at the same time prudent attentive to business vigilant acute argute inventive quick in resolving doubts and speculative questions  he shall be wise and judicious and learned  and why not humble and moderate and gentle tempered and good said yorick  and why not cried my uncle toby free and generous and bountiful and brave  he shall my dear toby replied my father getting up and shaking him by his hand  then brother shandy answered my uncle toby raising himself off the chair and laying down his pipe to take hold of my fathers other hand  i humbly beg i may recommend poor le fevers son to you  a tear of joy of the first water sparkled in my uncle tobys eye  and another the fellow to it in the coporals as the proposition was made  you will see why when you read le fevers story  the story of le fever it was some time in the summer of that year in which dendermond was taken by the allies when my uncle toby was one evening getting his supper with trim sitting behind him at a small sideboard  i say sitting  for in consideration of the corporals lame knee which sometimes gave him exquisite pain  when my uncle toby dined or supped alone he would never suffer the corporal to stand and the poor fellows veneration for his master was such that with a proper artillery my uncle toby could have taken dendermond itself with less trouble than he was able to gain this point over him for many a time when my uncle toby supposed the corporals leg was at rest he would look back and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful respect this bred more little squabbles betwixt them than all other causes for fiveandtwenty years together  but this is neither here nor there  why do i mention it  ask my pen  it governs me  i govern not it  he was one evening sitting thus at his supper when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand to beg a glass or two of sack it is for a poor gentleman  i think of the army said the landlord who has been taken ill at my house four days ago and has never held up his head since or had a desire to taste any thing till just now that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast   i think says he taking his hand from his forehead  it would comfort me    if i could neither beg borrow or buy such a thing  added the landlord  i would almost steal it for the poor gentleman he is so ill  i hope in god he will still mend continued he  we are all of us concerned for him  thou art a goodnatured soul i will answer for thee cried my uncle toby and thou shall drink the poor gentlemans health in a glass of sack thyself  and take a couple of bottles with my service and tell him he is heartily welcome to them and to a dozen more if they will do him good  though i am persuaded said my uncle toby as the landlord shut the door he is a very compassionate fellow  trim  yet i cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too there must be something more than common in him that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of his host  and of his whole family added the corporal for they are all concerned for him  step after him said my uncle toby  do trim  and ask if he knows his name   i have quite forgot it truly said the landlord coming back into the parlour with the corporal  but i can ask his son again  has he a son with him then said my uncle toby  a boy replied the landlord of about eleven or twelve years of age  but the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his father he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day  he has not stirred from the bedside these two days  my uncle toby laid down his knife and fork and thrust his plate from before him as the landlord gave him the account and trim without being ordered took away without saying one word and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco  trim said my uncle toby i have a project in my head as it is a bad night of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure and paying a visit to this poor gentleman  your honors roquelaure replied the corporal has not once been had on since the night before your honor received your wound when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of st nicholas  and besides it is so cold and rainy a night that what with the roquelaure and what with the weather it will be enough to give your honor your death and bring on your honors torment in your groin i fear so replied my uncle toby but i am not at rest in my mind trim since the account the landlord has given me  i wish i had not known so much of this affair  added my uncle toby  or that i had known more of it  how shall we manage it leave it ant please your honor to me quoth the corporal  i will take my hat and stick and go to the house and reconnoitre and act accordingly and i will bring your honor a full account in an hour  thou shall go trim said my uncle toby and here is a shilling sor thee to drink with his servant  i shall get it all out of him said the corporal shutting the door  it was not till my uncle toby had knocked the ashes out of his third pipe that corporal trim returned from the inn and gave him the following account  i despaired at first said the corporal of being able to bring back your honor any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick lieutenant  is he in the army then said my uncle toby  he is said the corporal  and in what regiment said my uncle toby  i will tell your honor replied the corporal every thing straight forwards as i learnt it  then trim i will fill another pipe said my uncle toby and not interrupt thee till thou have done so sit down at thy ease trim in the windowseat and begin thy story again the corporal made his old bow which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it  your honor is good  and having done that he sat down as he was ordered  and began the story to my uncle toby over again in pretty near the same words  i despaired at first said the corporal of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honor about the lieutenant and his son for when i asked where his servant was from whom i made myself sure of knowing every thing which was proper to be asked  that is a right distinction trim said my uncle toby  i was answered an please your honor that he had no servant with him  that he had come to the inn with hired horses which upon finding himself unable to proceed to join i suppose the regiment he had dismissed the morning after he came  if i get better my dear said he as he gave his purse to his son to pay the man  we can hire horses from hence  but alas the poor gentleman will never get from hence said the landlady to me  for i heard the deathwatch all night long  and when he dies the youth his son will certainly die with him for he is brokenhearted already  i was hearing this account continued the corporal when the youth came into the kitchen to order the thin toast the landlord spoke of  but i will do it for my father myself said the youth  pray let me save you the trouble young gentleman said i taking up a fork for the purpose and offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire whilst i did it  i believe sir said he very modestly i can please him best myself  i am sure said i his honor will not like the toast the worse for being toasted by an old soldier  the youth took hold of my hand and instantly burst into tears  poor youth said my uncle toby  he has been bred up from an infant in the army and the name of a soldier trim sounded in his ears like the name of a friend  i wish i had him here   i never in the longest march said the corporal had so great a mind to my dinner as i had to cry with him for company  what could be the matter with me an please your honor nothing in the world trim said my uncle toby blowing his nose  but that thou art a good natured fellow  when i gave him the toast continued the corporal i thought it was proper to tell him i was captain shandys servant and that your honor though a stranger was extremely concerned for his father  and that if there was any thing in your house or cellar  and thou might have added my purse too said my uncle toby  he was heartily welcome to it  he made a very low bow which was meant to your honor but no answer  for his heart was full  so he went up stairs with the toast  i warrant you my dear said i as i opened the kitchendoor your father will be well again  mr yoricks curate was smoking a pipe by the kitchen fire  but said not a word good or bad to comsort the youth  i thought it wrong added the corporal  i think so too said my uncle toby  when the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast he felt himself a little revived and sent down into the kitchen to let me know that in about ten minutes he should be glad if i would step up stairs  i believe said the landlord he is going to say his prayers  for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bedside and as i shut the door i saw his son take up a cushion   i thought said the curate that you gentlemen of the army mr trim never said your prayers at all  i heard the poor gentleman say his prayers last night said the landlady very devoutly and with my own ears or i could not have believed it  are you sure of it replied the curate  a soldier an please your reverence said i prays as often of his own accord as a parson  and when he is fighting for his king and for his own life and for his honor too he has the most reason to pray to god of any one in the whole world  twas well said of thee trim said my uncle toby  but when a soldier said i an please your reverence has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches up to his knees in cold water  or engaged said i for months together in long and dangerous marches harassed perhaps in his rear today  harassing others tomorrow  detached here  countermanded there  resting this night out upon his arms  beat up in his shirt the next  benumbed in his joints  perhaps without straw in his tent to kneel on  must say his prayers how and when he can  i believe said i  for i was piqued quoth the corporal for the reputation of the army i believe an please your reverence said i that when a soldier gets time to pray  he prays as heartily as a parson  though not with all his fuss and hypocrisy  thou should not have said that trim said my uncle toby  for god only knows who is a hypocrite and who is not  at the great and general review of us all corporal at the day of judgment and not till then  it will be seen who has done their duties in this world  and who has not and we shall be advanced trim accordingly  i hope we shall said trim  it is in the scripture said my uncle toby and i will show it thee tomorrow  in the mean time we may depend upon it trim for our comfort said my uncle toby that god almighty is so good and just a governor of the world that if we have but done our duties in it  it will never be enquired into whether we have done them in a red coat or a black one  i hope not said the corporal  but go on trim said my uncle toby with the story  when i went up continued the corporal into the lieutenants room which i did not do till the expiration of the ten minutes  he was lying in his bed with his head raised upon his hand with his elbow upon the pillow and a clean white cambrick handkerchief beside it  the youth was just stooping down to take up the cushion upon which i supposed he had been kneeling  the book was laid upon the bed  and as he rose in taking up the cushion with one hand he reached out his other to take it away at the same time let it remain there my dear said the lieutenant  he did not offer to speak to me till i had walked up close to his bedside  if you are captain shandys servant said he you must present my thanks to your master with my little boys thanks along with them for his courtesy to me  if he was of levenss  said the lieutenant  i told him your honor was  then said he i served three campaigns with him in flanders and remember him  but it is most likely as i had not the honor of any acquaintance with him that he knows nothing of me  you will tell him however that the person his good nature has laid under obligations to him is one le fever a lieutenant in anguss  but he knows me not  said he a second time musing  possibly he may my story  added he  pray tell the captain i was the ensign at breda whose wife was most unfortunately killed with a musket shot as she lay in my arms in my tent  i remember the story an please your honor said i very well  do you so said he wiping his eyes with his handkerchief  then well may i  in saying this he drew a little ring out of his bosom which seemed tied with a black ribband about his neck and kissed it twice  here billy said he  the boy flew across the room to the bedside  and falling down upon his knee took the ring in his hand and kissed it too  then kissed his father and sat down upon the bed and wept  i wish said my uncle toby with a deep sigh  i wish trim i was asleep  your honor replied the corporal is too much concerned  shall i pour your honor out a glass of sack to your pipe  do trim said my uncle toby  i remember said my uncle toby sighing again the story of the ensign and his wife  and particularly well that he as well as she upon some account or other i forget what was universally pitied by the whole regiment  but finish the story thou art upon  it is finished already said the corporal  for i could stay no longer  so wished his honor a good night young le fever rose from off the bed and saw me to the bottom of the stairs and as we went down together told me they had come from ireland and were on their route to join the regiment in flanders  but alas said the corporal  the lieutenants last days march is over  then what is to become of his poor boy cried my uncle toby  it was to my uncle tobys eternal honor that he set aside every other concern and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son   that kind being who is a friend to the friendless shall recompense thee for this  thou have left this matter short said my uncle toby to the corporal as he was putting him to bed  and i will tell thee in what trim  in the first place when thou made an offer of my services to le fever  as sickness and traveling are both expensive and thou know he was but a poor lieutenant with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay  that thou did not make an offer to him of my purse because had he stood in need thou know trim he had been as welcome to it as myself  your honor knows said the corporal i had no orders  true quoth my uncle toby  thou did very right trim as a soldier  but certainly very wrong as a man  in the second place for which indeed thou have the same excuse continued my uncle toby  when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house  thou should have offered him my house too a sick brother officer should have the best quarters trim and if we had him with us  we could tend and look to him  thou art an excellent nurse thyself trim and what with thy care of him and the old womans and his boys and mine together we might recruit him again at once and set him upon his legs    in a fortnight or three weeks added my uncle toby smiling  he might march  he will never march an please your honor in this world said the corporal  he will march said my uncle toby rising up from the side of the bed with one shoe off  an please your honor said the corporal he will never march but to his grave  he shall march cried my uncle toby marching the foot which had a shoe on though without advancing an inch  he shall march to his regiment  he cannot stand it said the corporal  he shall be supported said my uncle toby  he will drop at last said the corporal and what will become of his boy  he shall not drop said my uncle toby firmly  awelloday  do what we can for him said trim maintaining his point  the poor soul will die  he shall not die by g cried my uncle toby   the accusing spirit which flew up to heavens chancery with the oath blushed as he gave it in  and the recording angel as he wrote it down dropped a tear upon the word and blotted it out for ever   my uncle toby went to his bureau  put his purse into his breeches pocket and having ordered the corporal to go early in the morning for a physician  he went to bed and fell asleep  the sun looked bright the morning after to every eye in the village but le fevers and his afflicted sons the hand of death pressed heavy upon his eyelids  and hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its circle  when my uncle toby who had rose up an hour before his wonted time entered the lieutenants room and without preface or apology sat himself down upon the chair by the bedside and independently of all modes and customs opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it and asked him how he did  how he had rested in the night  what was his complaint  where was his pain  and what he could do to help him  and without giving him time to answer any one of the enquiries went on and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with the corporal the night before for him    you shall go home directly le fever said my uncle toby to my house  and well send for a doctor to see what is the matter  and well have an apothecary  and the corporal shall be your nurse  and i will be your servant le fever  there was a frankness in my uncle toby  not the effect of familiarity  but the cause of it  which let you at once into his soul  and showed you the goodness of his nature to this there was something in his looks and voice and manner superadded which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take shelter under him so that before my uncle toby had half finished the kind offers he was making to the father had the son insensibly pressed up close to his knees and had taken hold of the breast of his coat and was pulling it toward him  the blood and spirits of le fever which were waxing cold and slow within him and were retreating to their last citadel the heart  rallied back  the film forsook his eyes for a moment  he looked up wishfully in my uncle tobys face  then cast a look upon his boy  and that ligament fine as it was  was never broken   nature instantly ebbed again  the film returned to its place  the pulse fluttered  stopped  went on  throbbd  stopped again  moved  stopped  shall i go on  no  all that is necessary to be added is as follows   that my uncle toby with young le fever in his hand attended the poor lieutenant as chief mourners to his grave  when my uncle toby had turned every thing into money and settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and le fever and betwixt le fever and all mankind  there remained nothing more in my uncle tobys hands than an old regimental coat and a sword so that my uncle toby found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration the coat my uncle toby gave the corpora  wear it trim said my uncle toby as long as it will hold together for the sake of the poor lieutenant  and this said my uncle toby taking up the sword in his hand and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spoke  and this le fever i will save for thee  it is all the fortune continued my uncle toby hanging it up upon a crook and pointing to it  it is all the fortune my dear le fever which god has lest thee but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world  and thou do it like a man of honor  it is enough for us  as soon as my uncle toby had laid a foundation he sent him to a public school where excepting whitsuntide and christmas at which times the corporal was punctually dispatched for him  he remained to the spring of the year seventeen when the stories of the emperors sending his army into hungary against the turks kindling a spark of fire in his bosom he left his greek and latin without leave and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle toby begged his fathers sword and my uncle tobys leave along with it to go and try his fortune under eugene  twice did my uncle toby forget his wound and cry out le fever i will go with thee and thou shall fight beside me  and twice he laid his hand upon his groin and hung down his head in sorrow and disconsolation   my uncle toby took down the sword from the crook where it had hung untouched ever since the lieutenants death and delivered it to the corporal to brighten up  and having detained le fever a single fortnight to equip him and contract for his passage to leghorn  he put the sword into his hand  if thou art brave le fever said my uncle toby this will not fail thee  but fortune said he musing a little  fortune may  and if she does  added my uncle toby embracing him come back again to me le fever and we will shape thee another course  the greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of le fever more than my uncle tobys paternal kindness  he parted from my uncle toby as the best of sons from the best of fathers  both dropped tears  and as my uncle toby gave him his last kiss he slipped sixty guineas tied up in an old purse of his fathers in which was his mothers ring into his hand  and bid god bless him  le fever got up to the imperial army just time enough to try what metal his sword was made of at the defeat of the turks before belgrade but a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment and trod close upon his heels for four years together after he had withstood these bussetings to the last till sickness overtook him at marseilles from whence he wrote my uncle toby word he had lost his time his services his health and in short every thing but his sword  and was waiting for the first ship to return back to him  le fever was hourly expected and was uppermost in my uncle tobys mind all the time my father was giving him and yorick a description of what kind of a person he would choose for a preceptor to me but as my uncle toby thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments he required he forbore mentioning le fevers name  till the character by yoricks interposition ending unexpectedly in one who should be gentle tempered and generous and good it impressed the image of le fever and his interest upon my uncle toby so forcibly he rose instantly off his chair and laying down his pipe in order to take hold of both my fathers hands  i beg brother shandy said my uncle toby i may recommend poor le fevers son to you  i beseech you do added yorick  he has a good heart said my uncle toby  and a brave one too an please your honor said the corporal   the best hearts trim are ever the bravest replied my uncle toby  t shandy vol iii chap    the pulse paris  hail ye small sweet courtesies of life for smooth do ye make the road of it like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at first sight it is ye who open this door and let the stranger in   pray madame said i have the goodness to tell me which way i must turn to go to the opera comique  most willingly monsieur said she laying aside her work   i had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops as i came along in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interruption till at last this hitting my fancy i had walked in  she was working a pair of ruffles as she sat in a low chair on the far side of the shop facing the door    tres volontiers most willingly said she laying her work down upon a chair next her and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in with so cheerful a movement and so cheerful a look that had i been laying out fifty louis dors with her i should have said  this woman is grateful  you must turn monsieur said she going with me to the door of the shop and pointing the way down the street i was to take  you must turn first to your left hand  mais prenez guard  there are two turns and be so good as to take the second  then go down a little way and you will see a church and when you are past it give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right and that will lead you to the foot of the pont neuf which you must cross  and there any one will do himself the pleasure to show you   she repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good natured patience the third time as the first  and if tones and manners have a meaning which certainly they have unless to hearts which shut them out  she seemed really interested that i should not lose myself  i will not suppose it was the womans beauty notwithstanding she was the handsomest grisset i think i ever saw which had much to do with the sense i had of her courtesy only i remember when i told her how much i was obliged to her that i looked very full in her eyes  and that i repeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions  i had not got ten paces from the door before i found i had forgot every tittle of what she had said  so looking back and seeing her still standing in the door of the shop as if to look whether i went right or not  i returned back to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or left  for that i had absolutely forgot  is it possible said she half laughing  it is very possible replied i when a man is thinking more of a woman than of her good advice  as this was the real truth  she took it as every woman takes a matter of right with a slight courtesy   attendez said she laying her hand upon my arm to detain me whilst she called a lad out of the backshop to get ready a parcel of gloves am just going to send him said she with a packet into that quarter and if you will have the complaisance to step in it will be ready in a moment and he shall attend you to the place  so i walked in with her to the far side of the shop and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair as if i had a mind to sit she sat down herself in her low chair and i instantly sat myself down beside her   he will be ready monsieur said she in a moment  and in that moment replied i most willingly would i say something very civil to you for all these courtesies any one may do a casual act of good nature but a continuation of them shows it is a part of the temperature and certainly added i if it is the same blood which comes from the heart which descends to the extremes touching her wrist i am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the world  feel it said she holding out her arm so laying down my hat i took hold of her fingers in one hand and applied the two sorefingers of my other to the artery    would to heaven my dear eugenius thou had passed by and beheld me sitting in my black coat and in my lackadaysical manner counting the throbs of it one by one with as much true devotion as if i had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her fever  how would thou have laughed and moralized upon my new profession  and thou should have laughed and moralized on  trust me my dear eugenius i should have said there are worse occupations in this world than feeling a womans pulse  but a grissets thou would have said  and in an open shop yorick    so much the better for when my views are direct eugenius i care not if all the world saw me feel it  i had counted twenty pulsations and was going on fast toward the fortieth when her husband coming unexpected from a back parlour into the shop put me a little out of my reckoning  twas nobody but her husband she said  so i began a fresh score  monsieur is so good quoth she as he passed by us as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulse  the husband took off his hat and making a bow said i did him too much honor  and having said that he put on his hat and walked out  good god said i to myself as he went out  and can this man be the husband of this woman  let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation if i explain it to those who do not  in london a shopkeeper and a shopkeepers wife seem to be one bone and one flesh in the several endowments of mind and body sometimes the one sometimes the other has it so as in general to be upon a par and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do  in paris there are scarce two orders of beings more different for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husband he seldom comes there  in some dark and dismal room behind he sits commerceless in his thrum nightcap the same rough son of nature that nature left him  the genius of a people where nothing but the monarchy is salique having ceded this department with sundry others totally to the women  by a continual higgling with customers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a bag by amicable collisions they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles and not only become round and smooth but will receive some of them a polish like a brilliant  monsieur le marli is little better than the stone under your foot    surely  surely man it is not good for thee to sit alone  thou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings and this improvement of our natures from it i appeal to as my evidence   and how does it beat monsieur said she  with all the benignity said i looking quietly in her eyes that i expected  she was going to say something civil in return  but the lad came into the shop with the gloves  a propos said i i want a couple of pair myself  the beautiful grisset rose up when i said this and going behind the counter reached down a parcel and untied it i advanced to the side over against her they were all too large the beautiful grisset measured them one by one across my hand  it would not alter the dimensions  she begged i would try a single pair which seemed to be the least  she held it open  my hand slipped into it at once  it will not do said i shaking my head a little  no said she doing the same thing  there are certain combined looks of simple subtlety  where whim and sense and seriousness and nonsense are so blended that all the languages of babel set loose together could not express them  they are communicated and caught so instantaneously that you can scarce say which party is the infector i leave it to your men of words to swell pages about it  it is enough in the present to say again the gloves would not do so folding our hands within our arms we both lolld upon the counter  it was narrow and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us  the beautiful grisset looked sometimes at the gloves then sideways to the window then at the gloves  and then at me i was not disposed to break silence  i followed her example so i looked at the gloves then to the window then at the gloves and then at her  and so on alternately  i found i lost considerably in every attack  she had a quick black eye and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration that she looked into my very heart and reins  it may seem strange but i could actually feel she did   it is no matter said i taking up a couple of the pairs next me and putting them into my pocket  i was sensible the beautiful grisset had not asked above a single livre above the price  i wished she had asked a livre more and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter about  do you think my dear sir said she mistaking my embarrassment that i could ask a sous too much of a stranger  and of a stranger whose politeness more than his want of gloves has done me the honor to lay himself at my mercy  men croyez capable  faith not i said i and if you were you are welcome  so counting the money into her hand and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a shopkeepers wife i went out and her lad with his parcel followed me  sent journey page    the pieman seeing a man standing with a basket on the other side of a street in versailles as if he had something to sell i bid la fleur go up to him and enquire for the count de bs hotel  la fleur returned a little pale and told me it was a chevalier de st louis selling pates  it is impossible la fleur said i  la fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myself but persisted in his story he had seen the croix set in gold with its red ribband he said tied to his buttonhole  and had looked into his basket and seen the pates which the chevalier was selling so could not be mistaken in that  such a reverse in a mans life awakens a better principle than curiosity i could not help looking for some time at him as i sat in the remise  the more i looked at him his croix and his basket the stronger they wove themselves into my brain  i got out of the remise and went toward him  he was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees and with a sort of a bib which went half way up his breast upon the top of this but a little below the hem hung his croix his basket of little pates was covered over with a white damask napkin another of the same kind was spread at the bottom and there was a look of proprete and neatness throughout that one might have bought his pates of him as much from appetite as sentiment  he made an offer of them to neither but stood still with them at the corner of a hotel for those to buy who chose it without solicitation  he was about fortyeight  of a sedatelook something approaching to gravity i did not wonder  i went up rather to the basket than him and having lifted up the napkin and taken one of his pates into my hand  i begged he would explain the appearance which affected me  he told me in a few words that the best part of his life had passed in the service in which after spending a small patrimony he had obtained a company and the croix with it but that at the conclusion of the last peace his regiment being reformed and the whole corpse with those of some other regiments left without any provision  he found himself in a wide world without friends without a livre  and indeed said he without any thing but this  pointing as he said it to his croix  the poor chevalier won my pity and he finished the scene with winning my esteem too  the king he said was the most generous of princes but his generosity could neither relieve or reward every one and it was only his misfortune to be amongst the number he had a little wise he said whom he loved who did the patisserie and added he felt no dishonor in defending her and himself from want in this way  unless providence had offered him a better  it would be wicked to withhold a pleasure from the good in passing over what happened to this poor chevalier of st louis about nine months after  it seems he usually took his stand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace and as his croix had caught the eyes of numbers numbers had made the same enquiry which i had done  he had told them the same story and always with so much modesty and good sense that it had reached at last the kings ears  who hearing the chevalier had been a gallant officer and respected by the whole regiment as a man of honor and integrity  he broke up his little trade by a pension of fifteen hundred livres a year  sent journey page     as i have told this to please the reader i beg he will allow me to relate another out of its order to please myself  the two stories reflect light upon each other  and it is a pity they should be parted    the sword rennes  when states and empires have their periods of declension and feel in their turns what distress and poverty is  i stop not to tell the causes which gradually brought the house do you in britanny into decay the marquis do you had fought up against his condition with great firmness wishing to preserve and still show to the world some little fragments of what his ancestors had been  their indiscretions had put it out of his power there was enough left for the little exigencies of obscurity  but he had two boys who looked up to him for light  he thought they deserved it he had tried his sword  it could not open the way  the mounting was too expensive  and simple economy was not a match for it  there was no resource but commerce  in any other province in france save britanny this was smiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wished to see reblossom  but in britanny there being a provision for this he availed himself of it and taking an occasion when the states were assembled at rennes the marquis attended with his two sons entered the court and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy which though seldom claimed he said was no less in force he took his sword from his side  here said he take it and be trusty guardians of it till better times put me in condition to reclaim it  the president accepted the marquiss sword  he staid a few minutes to see it deposited in the archives of his house and departed  the marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for martinico and in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to business with some unlooked for bequests from distant branches of his house  returned home to reclaim his nobility and to support it  it was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller but a sentimental one that i should be at rennes at the very time of this solemn requisition i call it solemn  it was so to me  the marquis entered the court with his whole family he supported his lady  his eldest son supported his sister and his youngest was at the other extreme of the line next his mother  he put his handkerchief to his face twice    there was a dead silence when the marquis had approached within six paces of the tribunal he gave the marchioness to his youngest son and advancing three steps before his family  he reclaimed his sword  his sword was given him and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it almost out of the scabbard  it was the shining face of a friend he had once given up  he looked attentively a long it beginning at the hilt as if to see whether it was the same  when observing a little rust which it had contracted near the point he brought it near his eye and bending his head down over it  i think i saw a tear fall upon the place i could not be deceived by what followed  i shall find said he some other way to get it off  when the marquis had said this he returned his sword into its scabbard made a bow to the guardians of it  and with his wife and daughter and his two sons following him walked out  o how i envied him his feelings  s journey page     the ass i was stopped at the gate of lions by a poor ass who had just turned in with a couple of large panniers upon his back to collect eleemosynary turniptops and cabbageleaves and stood dubious with his two forefeet on the inside of the threshold and with his two hinder feet toward the street as not knowing very well whether he was to go in or no  now it is an animal be in what hurry i may i cannot bear to strike  there is a patient endurance of sufferings wrote so unaffectedly in his looks and carriage which pleads so mightily for him that it always disarms me and to that degree that i do not like to speak unkindly to him on the contrary meet him where i will  whether in town or country  in cart or under panniers  whether in liberty or bondage  i have ever something civil to say to him on my part and as one word begets another if he has as little to do as i  i generally fall into conversation with him and surely never is my imagination so busy as in framing his responses from the etchings of his countenance  and where those carry me not deep enough  in flying from my own heart into his and seeing what is natural for an ass to think  as well as a man upon the occasion  in truth it is the only creature of all the classes of beings below me with whom i can do this  for parrots jackdaws etc i never exchange a word with them  nor with the apes etc for pretty near the same reason they act by rote as the others speak by it and equally make me silent nay my dog and my cat though i value them both  and for my dog he would speak if he could  yet some how or other they neither of them possess the talents for conversation  i can make nothing of a discourse with them   but with an ass i can commune for ever come honesty said i  seeing it was impracticable to pass betwixt him and the gate  art thou for coming in or going out  the ass twisted his head round to look up the street   well  replied i  well wait a minute for  driver   he turned his head thoughtful about and looked wishfully the opposite way   i understand thee perfectly answered i  if thou take a wrong step in this affair he will cudgel thee to death  well a minute is but a minute and if it saves a fellow creature a drubbing it shall not be set down as illspent he was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on and in the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger and unsavouriness had dropped it out of his mouth half a dozen times and picked it up again  god help thee jack said i thou have a bitter breakfast on it  and many a bitter days labor  and many a bitter blow i fear for its wages  it is all  all bitterness to thee whatever life is to others  and now thy mouth if one knew the truth of it is as bitter i dare say as soot  for he had cast aside the stem and thou have not a friend perhaps in all this world that will give thee a macaroon  in saying this i pulled out a paper of them which i had just purchased and gave him one  and at this moment that i am telling it my heart smites me that there was more of pleasantry in the conceit of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroon  than of benevolence in giving him one which presided in the act  when the ass had eaten his macaroon i pressed him to come in  the poor beast was heavy loaded  his legs seemed to tremble under him  he hung rather backwards and as i pulled at his halter it broke short in my hand  he looked up pensive in my face  dont thrash me with it  but if you will you may  if i do said i i will be d  d the word was but one half of it pronounced when a person coming in let fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devils crupper which put an end to the ceremony out upon it cried i  tristram shandy vol iv chap    the sermon hebrews xiii     for we trust we have a good conscience  trust  trust we have a good conscience  certainly trim quoth my father interrupting him you give that sentence a very improper accent for you curl up your nose man and read it with such a sneering tone as if the parson was going to abuse the apostle  he is an please your honor replied trim  pugh said my father smiling  sir quoth doctor slop trim is certainly in the right for the writer who i perceive is a protestant by the snappish manner in which he takes up the apostle is certainly going to abuse him if this treatment of him has not done it already but from whence replied my father have you concluded so soon doctor slop that the writer is of our church  for aught i can see yet  he may be of any church  because answered doctor slop if he was of ours  he durst no more take such a license  than a bear by his beard  if in our communion sir a man was to insult an apostle  a saint  or even the paring of a saints nail  he would have his eyes scratched out  what by the saint quoth my uncle toby no replied doctor slop he would have an old house over his head pray is the inquisition an ancient building answered my uncle toby or is it a modern one  i know nothing of architecture replied doctor slop  an please your honors quoth trim the inquisition is the vilest  prithee spare thy description trim i hate the very name of it said my father  no matter for that answered doctor slop  it has its uses for though i am no great advocate for it yet in such a case as this he would soon be taught better manners and i can tell him if he went on at that rate would be flung into the inquisition for his pains god help him then quoth my uncle toby amen added trim for heaven above knows i have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it  i never heard one word of it before said my uncle toby hastily  how came he there trim  o sir the story will make your heart bleed  as it has made mine a thousand times  the short of the story is this  my brother tom went over a servant to lisbon  and married a jews widow who kept a small shop and sold sausages which somehow or other was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed where he was lying with his wife and two small children and carried directly to the inquisition where god help him continued trim fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart  the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour he was as honest a soul added trim pulling out his handkerchief as ever blood warmed    the tears trickled down trims cheeks faster than he could well wipe them away  a dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes  certain proof of pity come trim quoth my father after he saw the poor fellows grief had got a little vent  read on  and put this melancholy story out of thy head  i grieve that i interrupted thee but prithee begin the sermon again  for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse as thou say i have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the apostle has given  corporal trim wiped his face and returned his handkerchief into his pocket and making a bow as he did it  he began again  the sermon hebrews xiii     for we trust we have a good conscience    trust trust we have a good conscience surely if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence it must be this very thing  whether he has a good conscience or no  i am positive i am right quoth dr stop  if a man thinks at all he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this account  he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires  he must remember his past pursuits and know certainly the true springs and motives which in general have governed the actions of his life  i defy him without an assistant quoth dr slop  in other matters we may be deceived by false appearances and as the wise man complains hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth and with labor do we find the things that are before us but here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself  is conscious of the web she has wove  knows its texture and fineness and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has planned before her  the language is good and i declare trim reads very well quoth my father  now  as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within herself of this and the judgment either of approbation or censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives it is plain you will say from the very terms of the proposition  whenever this inward testimony goes against a man and he stands self accused  that he must necessarily be a guilty man  and on the contrary when the report is favorable on his side and his heart condemns him not  that it is not a matter of trust as the apostle intimates but a matter of certainty and fact that the conscience is good and that the man must be good also  then the apostle is altogether in the wrong i suppose quoth dr slop and the protestant divine is in the right sir have patience replied my father for i think it will presently appear that saint paul and the protestant divine are both of an opinion  as nearly so quoth dr slop as east is to west  but this continued he lifting both hands comes from the liberty of the press  it is no more at the worst replied my uncle toby than the liberty of the pulpit for it does not appear that the sermon is printed or ever likely to be  go on trim quoth my father  at first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case and i make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of man  that did no such thing ever happen as that the conscience of a man by long habits of sin might as the scripture assures it may insensibly become hard  and like some tender parts of his body by much stress and continual hard usage lose by degrees that nice sense and perception with which god and nature endowed it  did this never happen  or was it certain that selflove could never hang the least bias upon the judgment  or that the little interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions and encompass them about with clouds and thick darkness  could no such thing as favor and affection enter this sacred court  did wit disdain to take a bribe in it  or was ashamed to show its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment or lastly were we assured that interest stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing  and that passion never got into the judgment seat and pronounced sentence in the stead of reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the case  was this truly so as the objection must suppose  no doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed it  and the guilt or innocence of every mans life could be known in general by no better measure than the degrees of his own approbation and censure  i own in one case whenever a mans conscience does accuse him as it seldom errs on that side that he is guilty and unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases we may safely pronounce upon it that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation  but the converse of the proposition will not hold true  namely that whenever there is guilt the conscience must accuse and if it does not that a man is therefore innocent  this is not fact  so that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to himself  that he thanks god his mind does not misgive him and that consequently he has a good conscience because he has a quiet one  is fallacious  and as current as the inference is and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight yet when you look nearer to it and try the truth of this rule upon plain facts  you see it liable to so much error from a false application  the principal upon which it goes so often perverted  the whole force of it lost and sometimes so vilely cast away that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life which confirm the account  a man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles  exceptionable in his conduct to the world shall live shameless in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretense can justify  a sin by which contrary to all the workings of humanity he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guilt  rob her of her best dowry and not only cover her own head with dishonor  but involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake surely you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life  he can have no rest night or day from its reproaches  alas conscience had something else to do all this time than break in upon him as elijah reproached the god baal  this domestic god was either talking or pursuing or was in a journey or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke perhaps he was gone out into company with honor to fight a duel to pay off some debt at play  or dirty annuity the bargain of his lust perhaps conscience all this time was engaged at home talking aloud against petty larceny and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank of life secured him against all temptation of committing so that he lives as merrily  if he was of our church though quoth dr slop he could not   sleeps as soundly in his bed  and at last meets death as unconcernedly  perhaps much more so than a much better man  all this is impossible with us quoth dr slop turning to my father  the case could not happen in our church  it happens in ours however replied my father but too often  i own quoth dr slop struck a little with my fathers frank acknowledgment  that a man in the romish church may live as badly  but then he cannot easily die so  it is little matter replied my father with an air of indifference  how a rascal dies  i mean answered dr slop he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments  pray how many have you in all said my uncle toby  for i always forget  seven answered dr slop  humph  said my uncle toby though not accented as a note of acquiescence  but as an interjection of that particular species of surprise when a man in looking into a drawer finds more of a thing than he expected  humph replied my uncle toby dr slop who had an ear understood my uncle toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacraments  humph replied dr slop stating my uncle tobys argument over again to him  why sir are there not seven cardinal virtues  seven mortal sins  seven golden candlesticks  seven heavens  it is more than i know replied my uncle toby  are there not seven wonders of the world  seven days of the creation  seven planets  seven plagues  that there are quoth my father with a most affected gravity but prithee continued he go on with the rest of thy characters trim  another is sordid unmerciful here trim waved his right hand a straithearted selfish wretch incapable either of private friendship or public spirit take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer an please your honors cried trim i think this a viler man than the other  shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions  no thank god there is no occasion i pay every man his own  i have no fornication to answer to my conscience  no faithless vows or promises to make up  i have debauched no mans wife or child thank god i am not as other men adulterers unjust or even as this libertine who stands before me a third is crafty and designing in his nature view his whole life  it is nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges basely to defeat the true intent of all laws  plaindealing and the safe enjoyment of our several properties  you will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy man  shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth or the unsuspecting temper of his friend who would have trusted him with his life when old age comes on and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account and state it over again with his conscience  conscience looks into the statutes at large  finds no express law broken by what he has done  perceives no penalty or forseiture of goods and chattels incurred  sees no scourge waving over his head or prison opening his gates upon him  what is there to affright his conscience  conscience has got safely entrenched behind the letter of the law sits there invulnerable fortified with cases and reports so strongly on all sides  that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold  the character of this last man said dr slop interrupting trim is more detestable than all the rest  and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging lawyer amongst you  amongst us a mans conscience could not possibly continue so long blinded  three times in a year at least he must go to confession will that restore it to sight quoth my uncle toby  go on trim quoth my father it is very short replied trim  i wish it was longer quoth my uncle toby for i like it hugely  trim went on  a fourth man shall want even this refuge shall break through all their ceremony of slow chicane  scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose  see the barefaced villain how he cheats lies perjures robs murders  horrid  but indeed much better was not to be expected in the present case  the poor man was in the dark  his priest had got the keeping of his conscience  and all he would let him know of it was that he must believe in the pope  go to mass  cross himself  tell his beads  be a good catholic and that this in all conscience was enough to carry him to heaven what  if he perjures  why  he had a mental reservation in it  but if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent him  if he robs  if he stabs will not conscience on every such act receive a wound itself  aye  but the man has carried it to confession  the wound digests there and will do well enough and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution o popery what have thou to answer for  when not content with the too many natural and fatal ways through which the heart of man is every day thus treacherous to itself above all things  thou have wilfully set open the wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller too apt god knows to go astray of himself and confidently speak peace to himself when there is no peace  of this the common instances which i have drawn out of life are too notorious to require much evidence if any man doubts the reality of them or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himself  i must refer him a moment to his own reflections and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart  let him consider in how different a degree of detestation numbers of wicked actions stand there though equally bad and vicious in their own natures  he will soon find that such of them as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can give them  and that the others to which he feels no propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonor  when david surprised saul sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt of his robe  we read his heart smote him for what he had done  but in the matter of uriah where a faithful and gallant servant whom he ought to have loved and honored fell to make way for his lust  where conscience had so much greater reason to take the alarm his heart smote him not a whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that crime to the time nathan was sent to reprove him and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified during all that time for what he had done  thus conscience this once able monitor  placed on high as a judge within us and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too  by an unhappy train of causes and impediments takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passes  does its office so negligently  sometimes so corruptly  that it is not to be trusted alone and therefore we find there is a necessity an absolute necessity of joining another principle with it to aid if not govern its determinations  so that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled in  namely in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man an useful citizen a faithful subject to your king or a good servant to your god  call in religion and morality  look what is written in the law of god  how read thou  consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth  what say they  let conscience determine the matter upon these reports  and then if thy heart condemns thee not which is the case the apostle supposes  the rule will be infallible  here dr slop fell asleep   thou will have confidence toward god  that is have just grounds to believe the judgment thou have past upon thyself is the judgment of god and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that being to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions   blessed is the man indeed then as the author of the book of ecclesiasticus expresses it who is not pricked with the multitude of his sins blessed is the man whose heart has not condemned him whether he be rich or whether he be poor if he have a good heart a heart thus guided and informed he shall at all times rejoice in a cheerful countenance his mind shall tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above upon a tower on high    in the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists and give the state he lives in a better security for his behavior than all the causes and restrictions put together which lawmakers are forced to multiply  forced as i say as things stand human laws not being a matter of original choice but of pure necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves well intending by the many provisions made  that in all such corrupt and misguided cases where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us upright  to supply their force and by the terrors of gaols and halters oblige us to it  i see plainly said my father that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the temple  or at some assize  i like the reasoning and am sorry that dr slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction  for it is now clear that the parson as i thought at first never insulted st paul in the least  nor has there been brother the least difference between them  a great matter if they had differed replied my uncle toby  the best friends in the world may differ sometimes  true  brother toby quoth my father shaking hands with him  well fill our pipes brother and then trim shall go on   he read on as follows  to have the fear of god before our eyes and in our mutual dealings with each other to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong  the first of these will comprehend the duties of religion  the second those of morality which are so inseperably connected together that you cannot divide these two tables even in imagination though the attempt is often made in practice without breaking and mutually destroying them both  i said the attempt is often made and so it is  there being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none who would take it as the bitterest affront should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character  or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite  when there is some appearance that it is so  though one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty yet were we to look into the grounds of it in the present case i am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honor of his motive  let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject it will be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest his pride his ease or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress  i will illustrate this by an example  i know the banker i deal with or the physician i usually call in   there is no need cried dr slop waking to call in any physician in this case    to be neither of them men of much religion i hear them make a jest of it every day and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn as to put the matter past doubt well  notwithstanding this i put my fortune into the hands of the one  and what is dearer still to me i trust my life to the honest skill of the other  now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence why in the first place i believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power i put into their hands to my disadvantage  i consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life  i know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters  in a word i am persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more  but put it otherwise namely that interestlay for once on the other side that a case should happen wherein the one without stain to his reputation could secret my fortune and leave me naked in the world  or that the other could send me out of it and enjoy an estate by my death without dishonor to himself or his art  in this case what hold have i of either of them  religion the strongest of all motives is out of the question  interest the next most powerful motive in the world is strongly against me  what have i lest to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptation  alas i have nothing  nothing but what is lighter than a bubble  i must lie at the mercy of honor or some such capricious principle strait security for two of the most valuable blessings  my property and myself  as therefore we can have no dependence upon morality without religion  so on the other hand there is nothing better to be expected from religion without morality nevertheless it is no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a religious man  he shall not only be covetous revengeful implacable  but even wanting in points of common honesty yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the age  is zealous for some points of religion  goes twice a day to church  attends the sacraments  and amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religion  shall cheat his conscience into a judgment that for this he is a religious man and has discharged truly his duty to god and you will find that such a man through force of this delusion generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety  though perhaps ten times more real honesty than himself   this likewise is a sore evil under the sun and i believe there is no one mistaken principle which for its time has wrought more serious mischiefs    for a general proof of this  examine the history of the romish church   well what can you make of that cried dr slop  see what scenes of cruelty murder rapine bloodshed  they may thank their own obstinacy cried dr slop  have all been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality  in how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided sainterrant spared neither age or merit or sex or condition  and as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity he showed none mercilessly trampled upon both  heard neither the cries of the unfortunate nor pitied their distresses  i have been in many a battle an please your honor quoth trim sighing but never in so melancholy a one as this  i would not have drawn a tricker in it against these poor souls  to have been made a general officer  why what do you understand of the affair said dr slop looking toward trim with something more of contempt than the corporals honest heart deserved  what do you know friend about this battle you talk of  i know replied trim that i never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for it  but to a woman or a child continued trim before i would level my musket at them i would lose my life a thousand times  here is a crown for thee trim to drink with obadiah tonight quoth my uncle toby  god bless your honor replied trim  i had rather these poor women and children had it  thou art an honest fellow quoth my uncle toby  my father nodded his head  as much as to say  and so he is   but prithee trim said my father make an end  for i see thou have but a leaf or two left  corporal trim read on  if the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient  consider at this instant how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honor to god by actions which are a dishonor and scandal to themselves  to be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons of the inquisition  god help my poor brother tom  behold religion with mercy and justice chained down under her feet  there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal propped up with racks and instruments of torment hark  hark what a piteous groan  here trims face turned as pale as ashes  see the melancholy wretch who uttered it  here the tears began to trickle down  just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock trial and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has been able to invent  d  n them all quoth trim his color returning into his face as red as blood  behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors  his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement  oh it is my brother cried poor trim in a most passionate exclamation dropping the sermon upon the ground and clapping his hands together  i fear it is poor tom my fathers and my uncle tobys heart yearned with sympathy for the poor fellows distress even slop himself acknowledged pity for him  why trim said my father this is not a history  it is a sermon thou art reading prithee begin the sentence again  behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors  his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers  observe the last movement of that horrid engine  i would rather face a cannon quoth trim stamping  see what convulsions it has thrown him into  consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched  what exquisite tortures he endures by it  it is all nature can bear good god see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips i would not read another line of it quoth trim for all this world  i fear an please your honors all this is in portugal where my poor brother tom is i tell thee trim again quoth my father it is not an historical account  it is a description  it is only a description honest man quoth slop there is not a word of truth in it  that is another story replied my father  however as trim reads it with so much concern  it is cruelty to force him to go on with it  give me hold of the sermon trim  i will finish it for thee and thou may go i must stay and hear it too replied trim if your honor will allow me  though i would not read it myself for a colonels pay  poor trim quoth my uncle toby  my father went on   consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched  what exquisite torture he endures by it  it is all nature can bear good god see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips  willing to take its leave  but not suffered to depart  behold the unhappy wretch led back to his cell   then thank god however quoth trim they have not killed him   see him dragged out of it again to meet the flames and the insults in his last agonies which this principle  this principle that there can be religion without mercy has prepared for him the surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is to trace down the consequences such a notion has produced and compare them with the spirit of christianity  it is the short and decisive rule which our savior has left us for these and such like cases and it is worth a thousand arguments  by their fruits ye shall know them  i will add no farther to the length of this sermon than by two or three short and independent rules deducible from it   first whenever a man talks dly against religion always suspect that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the better of his creed a bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbors and where they separate depend upon it it is for no other cause but quietness sake   secondly when a man thus represented tells you in any particular instance  that such a thing goes against his conscience  always believe he means exactly the same thing as when he tells you such a thing goes against his stomach  a present want of appetite being generally the true cause of both  in a word  trust that man in nothing who has not a conscience in every thing  and in your own case remember this plain distinction a mistake in which has ruined thousands  that your conscience is not a law  no god and reason made the law and have placed conscience within you to determine  not like an asiatic cadi according to the ebbs and flows of his own passions  but like a british judge in this land of liberty and good sense who makes no new law but faithfully declares that law which he knows already written  end of the sermon  t shandy v   c  0 remainder of the story of trims brother as toms place an please your honor was easy  and the weather warm  it put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the world and as it fell out about that time that a jew who kept a saugage shop in the same street had the ill luck to die of a strangury and leave his widow in possession of a rousing trade  tom thought as every body in lisbon was doing the best he could divise for himself there could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on so without any introduction to the widow except that of buying a pound of sausages at her shop  tom set out  counting the matter thus within himself as he walked along that let the worst come of it that could he should at least get a pound of sausages for their worth  but if things went well he should be set up inasmuch as he should get not only a pound of sausages  but a wife  and a sausage shop an please your honor into the bargain  every servant in the family from high to low wished tom success and i can fancy an please your honor i see him this moment with his white dimity waistcoat and breeches and hat a little oone side passing jollily along the street swinging his stick with a smile and a cheerful word for every body he met  but alas tom thou smilest no more cried the corporal looking on one side of him upon the ground as if he apostrophised him in his dungeon  poor fellow said my uncle toby feelingly  he was an honest lighthearted lad an please your honor as ever blood warmed   then he resembled thee trim said my uncle toby rapidly  the corporal blushed down to his fingers ends  a tear of sentimental bashfulness  another of gratitude to my uncle toby  and a tear of sorrow for his brothers misfortunes started into his eye and ran sweetly down his cheek together my uncle tobys kindled as one lamp does at another and taking hold of the breast of trims coat which had been that of le fevers as if to ease his lame leg but in reality to gratify a finer feeling  he stood silent for a minute and a half at the end of which he took his hand away and the corporal making a bow went on with his story of his brother and the jews widow  when tom an please your honor got to the shop there was nobody in it but a poor negro girl with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to the end of a long cane flapping away flies  not killing them   it is a pretty picture said my uncle toby  she had suffered persecution trim and had learnt mercy    she was good an please your honor from nature as well as from hardships and there are circumstances in the story of that poor friendless slut that would melt a heart of stone said trim and some dismal winters evening when your honor is in the humor they shall be told you with the rest of toms story for it makes a part of it  then do not forget trim said my uncle toby  a negro has a soul an please your honor said the corporal doubtingly  i am not much versed corporal quoth my uncle toby in things of that kind but i suppose god would not leave him without one any more than thee or me  it would be putting one sadly over the head of another quoth the corporal  it would so said my uncle toby  why then an please your honor is a black wench to be used worse than a white one  i can give no reason said my uncle toby    only cried the corporal shaking his head because she has no one to stand up for her   it is that very thing trim quoth my uncle toby  which recommends her to protection  and her brethren with her it is the fortune of war which has put the whip into our hands now  where it may be hereafter heaven knows  but be it where it will the brave trim will not use it unkindly   god forbid said the corporal  amen responded my uncle toby laying his hand upon his heart  the corporal returned to his story and went on  but with an embarrassment in doing it which here and there a reader in this world will not be able to comprehend for by the many sudden transitions all along from one kind and cordial passion to another in getting thus far on his way he had lost the sportable key of his voice which gave sense and spirit to his tale he attempted twice to resume it but could not please himself so giving a stout hem to rally back the retreating spirits and aiding nature at the same time with his left arm akimbo on one side and with his right a little extended supported her on the other  the corporal got as near the note as he could and in that attitude continued his story  as tom an please your honor had no business at that time with the moorish girl he passed on into the room beyond to talk to the jews widow about love  and being as i have told your honor an open cheary hearted lad with his character wrote in his looks and carriage he took a chair and without much apology but with great civility at the same time placed it close to her at the table and sat down  now a widow an please your honor always chooses a second husband as unlike the first as she can so the affair was settled in her mind before tom mentioned it  she signed the capitulation  and tom sealed it and there was an end of the matter  t shandy v iv c    the beguine so thou wast once in love trim said my uncle toby smiling   souse replied the corporal  over head and ears an please your honor prithee when where  and how came it to pass  i never heard one word of it before quoth my uncle toby  i dare say answered trim that every drummer and serjeants son in the regiment knew of it  it is high time i should  said my uncle toby  your honor remembers with concern said the corporal the total rout and confusion of our camp and the army at the affair of landen every one was left to shift for himself and if it had not been for the regiments of wyndham lumley and galway which covered the retreat over the bridge of neerspeeken the king himself could scarce have gained it  he was pressed hard as your honor knows on every side of him   gallant mortal cried my uncle toby caught up with enthusiasm  this moment now that all is lost i see him galloping across me corporal to the left to bring up the remains of the english horse along with him to support the right and tear the laurel from luxembourgs brows if yet it is possible  i see him with the knot of his scarf just shot off infusing fresh spirits into poor galways regiment  riding along the line  then wheeling about and charging conti at the head of it  brave brave by heaven cried my uncle toby he deserves a crown  as richly as a thief a halter shouted trim  my uncle toby knew the corporals loyalty  otherwise the comparison was not at all to his mind  it did not altogether strike the corporals fancy when he had made it  but it could not be recalled  so he had nothing to do but proceed  as the number of wounded was prodigious and no one had time to think of any thing but his own safety  though talmash said my uncle toby brought off the foot with great prudence  but i was left upon the field said the corporal thou wast so poor fellow replied my uncle toby  so that it was noon the next day continued the corporal before i was exchanged and put into a cart with thirteen or fourteen more in order to be conveyed to our hospital  the anguish of my knee continued the corporal was excessive in itself and the uneasiness of the cart with the roughness of the roads which were terribly cut up  making bad still worse  every step was death to me so that with the loss of blood and the want of care taking of me and a fever i felt coming on besides  poor soul said my uncle toby all together an please your honor was more than i could sustain  i was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasants house where our cart which was the last of the line had halted they had helped me in and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropped it upon some sugar and seeing it had cheered me she had given it me a second and a third time  so i was telling her an please your honor the anguish i was in and was saying it was so intolerable to me that i had much rather lie down upon the bed turning my face toward one which was in the corner of the room  and die than go on  when upon her attempting to lead me to it i fainted away in her arms she was a good soul as your honor said the coporal wiping his eyes will hear  i thought love had been a joyous thing quoth my uncle toby  it is the most serious thing an please your honor sometimes that is in the world  by the persuasion of the young woman continued the corporal the cart with the wounded men set off without me she had assured them i should expire immediately if i was put into the cart so when i came to myself  i found myself in a still quiet cottage with no one but the young woman and the peasant and his wife i was laid across the bed in the corner of the room with my wounded leg upon a chair and the young woman beside me holding the corner of her handkerchief dipped in vinegar to my nose with one hand and rubbing my temples with the other  i took her at first for the daughter of the peasant for it was no inn  so had offered her a little purse with eighteen florins which my poor brother tom here trim wiped his eyes had sent me as a token by a recruit just before he set out for lisbon   the young woman called the old man and his wife into the room to show them the money in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little necessaries i should want till i should be in a condition to be got to the hospital  come then said she tying up the little purse  i will be your banker  but as that office alone will not keep me employed i will be your nurse too  i thought by her manner of speaking this as well as by her dress which i then began to consider more attentively  that the young woman could not be the daughter of the peasant she was in black down to her toes with her hair concealed under a cambrick border laid close to her forehead she was one of those kind of nuns an please your honor of which your honor knows there are a good many in flanders which they let go loose  by thy description trim said my uncle toby i dare say she was a young beguine of which there are none to be found any where but in the spanish netherlands  except at amsterdam  they differ from nuns in this that they can quit their cloister if they choose to marry they visit and take care of the sick by profession  i had rather for my own part they did it out of goodnature  the young beguine continued the corporal had scarce given herself time to tell me she would be my nurse when she hastily turned about to begin the office of one and prepare something for me  and in a short time  though i thought it a long one  she came back with flannels etc etc and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours and made me a thin basin of gruel for my supper  she wished me rest and promised to be with me early in the morning  she wished me an please your honor what was not to be had my fever ran very high that night  her figure made sad disturbance within me  i was every moment cutting the world in two  to give her half of it  and every moment was i crying that i had nothing but a knapsack and eighteen florins to share with her  the whole night long was the fair beguine like an angel close by my bed side holding back my curtain and offering me cordials  and i was only awakened from my dream by her coming there at the hour promised and giving them in reality in truth she was scarce ever from me and so accustomed was i to receive life from her hands that my heart sickened and i lost color when she left the room  love an please your honor is exactly like war in this that a soldier though he has escaped three weeks complete of saturdaynight  may nevertheless be shot through his heart on sunday morning  it happened so here an please your honor with this difference only  that it was on sunday in the afternoon when i fell in love all at once with a sisserara  it burst upon me an please your honor like a bomb  scarce giving me time to say god bless me  i thought trim said my uncle toby a man never fell in love so very suddenly  yes an please your honor if he is in the way of it  replied trim  i prithee quoth my uncle toby inform me how this matter happened   with all pleasure said the corporal making a bow i had escaped continued the corporal all that time from falling in love and had gone on to the end of the chapter had it not been predestined otherwise  there is no resisting our fate it was on a sunday in the afternoon as i told your honor the old man and his wife had walked out  every thing was still and hush as midnight about the house   there was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the yard when the fair beguine came in to see me  my wound was then in a fair way of doing well  the inflammation had been gone off for some time but it was succeeded with an itching both above and below my knee so insufferable that i had not shut my eyes the whole night for it let me see it said she kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee and laying her hand upon the part below it  it only wants rubbing a little said the beguine so covering it with the bed clothes she began with the forefinger of her right hand to rub under my knee guiding her forefinger backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel which kept on the dressing  in five or six minutes i felt slightly the end of her second finger  and presently it was laid flat with the other and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while it then came into my head that i should fall in love  i blushed when i saw how white a hand she had  i shall never an please your honor behold another hand so white whilst i live   the young beguine continued the corporal perceiving it was of great service to me  from rubbing for some time with two fingers  proceeded to rub at length with three  till by little and little she brought down the fourth and then rubbed with her whole hand i will never say another word an please your honor upon hands again  but is was softer than satin   prithee trim commend it as much as thou will said my uncle toby i shall hear thy story with the more delight  the corporal thanked his master most unfeignedly but having nothing to say upon the beguines hand but the same over again  he proceeded to the effects of it  the fair beguine said the corporal continued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee  till i feared her zeal would weary her  i would do a thousand times more said she for the love of christ as she continued rubbing  i felt it spread from under her hand an please your honor to every part of my frame   the more she rubbed and the longer strokes she took  the more the fire kindled in my veins  till at length by two or three strokes longer than the rest  my passion rose to the highest pitch  i seized her hand  and then thou clappedst it to thy lips trim said my uncle toby  and made a speech  whether the corporals amor terminated precisely in the way my uncle toby described it is not material it is enough that it contained in it the essence of all the loveromances which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world  t shandy vol   chap    maria  they were the sweetest notes i ever heard and i instantly let down the foreglass to hear them more distinctly  it is maria said the postillion observing i was listening  poor maria continued he leaning his body on one side to let me see her for he was in a line betwixt us is sitting upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe with her little goat beside her  the young fellow uttered this with an accent and a look so perfectly in tune to a feeling heart that i instantly made a vow i would give him a fourandtwenty sous piece when i got to moulines  and who is poor maria said i  the love and pity of all the villages around us said the postillion  it is but three years ago that the sun did not shine upon so fair so quickwitted and amiable a maid and better fate did maria deserve than to have her banns forbid by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published them   he was going on when maria who had made a short pause put the pipe to her mouth and began the air again  they were the same notes  yet were ten times sweeter it is the evening service to the virgin said the young man  but who has taught her to play it  or how she came by her pipe no one knows we think that heaven has assisted her in both for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind it seems her only consolation  she has never once had the pipe out of her hand but plays that service upon it almost night and day  the postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural eloquence that i could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition and should have sifted out his history had not poor marias taken such full possession of me  we had got up by this time almost to the bank where maria was sitting she was in a thin white jacket with her hair all but two tresses drawn up into a silk net with a few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on one side  she was beautiful and if ever i felt the full force of an honest heartache it was the moment i saw her    god help her poor damsel above a hundred masses said the postillion have been said in the several parish churches and convents around for her  but without effect we have still hopes as she is sensible for short intervals that the virgin at last will restore her to herself but her parents who know her best are hopeless upon that score and think her senses are lost for ever  as the postillion spoke this maria made a cadence so melancholy so tender and querulous that i sprung out of the chaise to help her and found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before i relapsed from my enthusiasm  maria looked wistfully for some time at me and then at her goat  and then at me  and then at her goat again and so on alternately    well maria said i softly  what resemblance do you find  i do entreat the candid reader to believe me that it was from the humblest conviction of what a beast man is  that i asked the question and that i would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of misery to be entitled to all the wit that ever rabelais scattered  and yet i own my heart smote me and that i so smarted at the very idea of it that i swore i would set up for wisdom and utter grave sentences the rest of my days  and never  never attempt again to commit mirth with man woman or child the longest day i had to live  as for writing nonsense to them  i believe there was a reserve  but that i leave to the world  adieu maria  adieu poor hapless damsel some time but not now i may hear thy sorrows from thy own lips  but i was deceived for that moment she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it that i rose up and with broken and irregular steps walked softly to my chaise  t shandy vol iv c    maria moulines  i never felt what the distress of plenty was in any one shape till now  to travel it through the bourbonnois the sweetest part of france  in the heyday of the vintage when nature is pouring her abundance into every ones lap and every eye is lifted up  a journey through each step of which music beats time to labor and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their clusters  to pass through this with my affections flying out and kindling at every group before me  and every one of them was pregnant with adventures  just heaven  it would fill up twenty volumes  and alas i have but a few small pages left of this to crowd it into  and half of these must be taken up with the poor maria my friend mr shandy met with near moulines  the story he had told of that disordered maid affected me not a little in the reading but when i got within the neighborhood where she lived it returned so strong into my mind that i could not resist an impulse which prompted me to go half a league out of the road to the village where her parents dwelt to enquire after her  it is going i own like the knight of the woeful countenance in quest of melancholy adventures  but i know not how it is but i am never so perfectly conscious of the existence of a soul within me as when i am entangled in them  the old mother came to the door her looks told me the story before she opened her mouth  she had lost her husband he had died she said of anguish for the loss of marias senses about a month before  she had feared at first she added that it would have plundered her poor girl of what little understanding was left  but on the contrary it had brought her more to herself  still she could not rest  her poor daughter she said crying was wandering somewhere about the road    why does my pulse beat languid as i write this and what made la fleur whose heart seemed only to be tuned to joy to pass the back of his hand twice across his eyes as the woman stood and told it i beckoned to the postillion to turn back into the road  when we had got within half a league of moulines at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket i discovered poor maria sitting under a poplar  she was sitting with her elbow in her lap and her head leaning on one side within her hand  a small brook ran at the foot of the tree  i bid the postillion go on with the chaise to moulines  and la fleur to bespeak my supper  and that i would walk after him  she was dressed in white and much as my friend described her except that her hair hung loose which before was twisted within a silknet  she had superadded likewise to her jacket a pale green riband which fell across her shoulder to the waist at the end of which hung her pipe  her goat had been as faithless as her lover and she had got a little dog in lieu of him which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle as i looked at her dog she drew him toward her with the string  thou shall not leave me sylvio said she i looked in marias eyes and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat for as she uttered them the tears trickled down her cheeks  i sat down close by her and maria let me wipe them away as they fell with my handkerchief  i then steeped it in my own  and then in hers  and then in mine  and then i wiped hers again  and as i did it i selt such undescribable emotions within me as i am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion  i am positive i have a soul nor can all the books with which materialists have pestered the world ever convince me to the contrary  when maria had come a little to herself i asked her if she remembered a pale thin person of a man who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before she said she was unsettled much at that time but remembered it upon two accounts  that ill as she was she saw the person pitied her and next that her goat had stolen his handkerchief and she had beat him for the theft  she had washed it she said in the brook and kept it ever since in her pocket to restore it to him in case she should ever see him again which she added he had half promised her as she told me this she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves tied round with a tendril  on opening it i saw an s marked in one of the corners  she had since that she told me strayed as far as rome and walked round st peters once  and returned back  that she found her way alone across the apennines  had traveled over all lombardy without money  and through the flinty roads of savoy without shoes  how she had borne it and how she had got supported she could not tell  but god tempers the wind said maria to the shorn lamb  shorn indeed and to the quick said i and wast thou in my own land where i have a cottage i would take thee to it and shelter thee thou should eat of my own bread and drink of my own cup  i would be kind to thy sylvio  in all thy weaknesses and wanderings i would seek after thee and bring thee back  when the sun went down i would say my prayers and when i had done thou should play thy evening song upon thy pipe nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart  nature melted within me as i uttered this and maria observing as i took out my handkerchief that it was steeped too much already to be of use would needs go wash it in the stream  and where will you dry it maria said i  i will dry it in my bosom said she  twill do me good  and is your heart still so warm maria said i  i touched upon the string on which hung all her sorrows  she looked with wistful disorder for sometime in my face and then without saying any thing took her pipe and played her service to the virgin  the string i had touched ceased to vibrate  in a moment or two maria returned to herself  let her pipe fall  and rose up  and where are you going maria said i  she said to moulines  let us go said i together  maria put her arm within mine and lengthening the string to let the dog follow  in that order we entered moulines  though i hate salutations and greetings in the marketplace yet when we got into the middle of this i stopped to take my last look and last farewell of maria  maria though not tall was nevertheless of the first order of fine forms  affliction had touched her looks with something that was scarce earthly  still she was feminine  and so much was there about her of all that the heart wishes or the eye looks for in woman that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain and those of elizas out of mine she should not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup but maria should lie in my bosom and be unto me as a daughter  adieu poor luckless maiden  imbibe the oil and wine which the compassion of a stranger as he journeyeth on his way now pours into thy wounds  the being who has twice bruised thee can only bind them up for ever  sent journey page     sensibility  dear sensibility source inexhausted of all that is precious in our joys or costly in our sorrows thou chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of straw  and it is thou who lifts him up to heaven  eternal fountain of our feelings it is here i trace thee  and this is thy  divinity which stirs within me  not that in some sad and sickening moments  my soul shrinks back upon herself and startles at destruction  mere pomp of words  but that i feel some generous joys and generous cares beyond myself  all comes from thee great  great sensorium of the world which vibrates if a hair of our heads but falls upon the ground in the remotest desert of thy creation  touched with thee eugenius draws my curtain when i languish  hears my tale of symptoms and blames the weather for the disorder of his nerves thou givst a portion of it sometimes to the roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest mountains  he finds the lacerated lamb of anothers flock  this moment i beheld him leaning with his head against his crook with piteous inclination looking down upon it  oh had i come one moment sooner  it bleeds to death  his gentle heart bleeds with it   peace to thee generous swain  i see thou walk off with anguish  but thy joys shall balance it  for happy is thy cottage  and happy is the sharer of it  and happy are the lambs which sport about you  sent journey p     the supper a shoe coming loose from the forefoot of the thillhorse at the beginning of the ascent of mount taurira the postillion dismounted twisted the shoe off and put it in his pocket as the ascent was of five or six miles and that horse our main dependence i made a point of having the shoe fastened on again as well as we could but the postillion had thrown away the nails and the hammer in the chaisebox being of no great use without them i submitted to go on  he had not mounted half a mile higher when coming to a flinty piece of road the poor devil lost a second shoe and from off his other forefoot i then got out of the chaise in good earnest and seeing a house about a quarter of a mile to the left hand with a great deal to do i prevailed upon the postillion to turn up to it the look of the house and of every thing about it as we drew nearer soon reconciled me to the disaster  it was a little farmhouse surrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard about as much corn  and close to the house on one side was a potagerie of an acre and a half full of every thing which could make plenty in a french peasants house  and on the other side was a little wood which furnished wherewithal to dress it it was about eight in the evening when i got to the house  so i left the postillion to manage his point as he could  and for mine i walked directly into the house  the family consisted of an old greyheaded man and his wife with five or six sons and sonsinlaw and their several wives and a joyous genealogy out of them  they were all sitting down together to their lentilsoup a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table and a flaggon of wine at each end of it promised joy through the stages of the repast  twas a feast of love  the old man rose up to meet me and with a respectful cordiality would have me sit down at the table my heart was set down the moment i entered the room so i sat down at once like a son of the family and to invest myself in the character as speedily as i could i instantly borrowed the old mans knife and taking up the loaf cut myself a hearty luncheon and as i did it i saw a testimony in every eye not only of an honest welcome but of a welcome mixed with thanks that i had not seemed to doubt it  was it this or tell me nature what else it was that made this morsel so sweet  and to what magic i owe it that the draught i took of their flaggon was so delicious with it that they remain upon my palate to this hour  if the supper was to my taste  the grace which followed it was much more so  the grace when supper was over the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife to bid them prepare for the dance the moment the signal was given the women and girls ran all together into the back apartment to tie up their hair  and the young men to the door to wash their faces and change their sabots and in three minutes every soul was ready upon a little esplanade before the house to begin  the old man and his wife came out last and placing me betwixt them sat down upon a sopha of turf by the door  the old man had some fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle  and at the age he was then of touched it well enough for the purpose his wife sung nowandthen a little to the tune  then intermitted  and joined her old man again as their children and grandchildren danced before them  it was not till the middle of the second dance when for some pauses in the movement wherein they all seemed to look up i fancied i could distinguish an elevation of spirit different from that which is the cause or the effect of simple jollity  in a word i thought i beheld religion mixing in the dance  but as i had never seen her so engaged i should have looked upon it now as one of the illusions of an imagination which is eternally misleading me had not the old man as soon as the dance ended said that this was their constant way and that all his life long he made it a rule after supper was over to call out his family to dance and rejoice believing he said that a cheerful and contented mind was the best sort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate peasant could pay    or a learned prelate either said i  sent journey p     cottage happiness nature in the midst of thy disorders thou art still friendly to the scantiness

 long  long since had ye numbered out my days had i not trod so great a part of them upon this enchanted ground when my way is too rough for my feet or too steep for my strength i get off it to some smooth velvet path which fancy has scattered over with rosebuds of delights and having taken a few turns in it come back strengthened and refreshed  when evils press sore upon me and there is no retreat from them in this world then i take a new course  i leave it  and as i have a clearer idea of the elysian fields than i have of heaven i force myself like aeneas into them  i see him meet the pensive shade of his forsaken dido  and wish to recognize it  i see the injured spirit wave her head and turn off silent from the author of her miseries and dishonours  i lose the feelings for myself in here is  and in those affections which were wont to make me mourn for her when i was at school  surely this is not walking in a vain shadow  nor does man disquiet himself in vain by it  he oftener does so in trusting the issue of his commotions to reason only  i can safely say for myself i was never able to conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively as by beating up as fast as i could for some kindly and gentle sensation to fight it upon its own ground  sent journey p     le dimanche it was sunday and when la fleur came in the morning with my coffee and roll and butter he had got himself so gallantly arrayed i scarce knew him  i had covenanted at montriul to give him a new hat with a silver button and loop and four louis dors pour sadoniser when we got to paris and the poor fellow to do him justice had done wonders with it  he had bought a bright clean good scarlet coat and a pair of breeches of the same  they were not a crown worse he said for the wearing  i wished him hanged for telling me  they looked so fresh that though i knew the thing could not be done yet i would rather have imposed upon my fancy with thinking i had bought them new for the fellow than that they had come out of the rue de friperie  this is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at paris  he had purchased moreover a handsome blue satin waistcoat fancifully enough embroidered  this was indeed something the worse for the service it had done but t was clean scoured  the gold had been touched up and upon the whole was rather showy than otherwise  and as the blue was not violent it suited with the coat and breeches very well he had squeezed out of the money moreover a new bag and a solitaire and had insisted with the fripier upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches knees  he had purchased muslin ruffles bien brodees with four livres of his own money  and a pair of white silk stockings for five more  and to top all nature had given him a handsome figure without costing him a sous  he entered the room thus set off with his hair dressed in the first style and with a handsome bouquet in his breast  in a word there was that look of festivity in every thing about him which at once put me in mind it was sunday  and by combining both together it instantly struck me that the favor he wished to ask of me the night before was to spend the day as every body in paris spent it besides i had scarce made the conjecture when la fleur with infinite humility but with a look of trust as if i should not refuse him begged i would grant him the day pour fair le galant visavis de sa maitresse  now it was the very thing i intended to do myself visavis madame de r  i had retained the remise on purpose for it and it would not have mortified my vanity to have had a servant so well dressed as la fleur was to have got up behind it i never could have worse spared him  but we must feel not argue in these embarrassments  the sons and daughters of service part with liberty but not with nature in their contracts they are flesh and blood and have their little vanities and wishes in the midst of the house of bondage as well as their task masters  no doubt they have set their selfdenials at a price  and their expectations are so unreasonable that i would often disappoint them but that their condition puts it so much in my power to do it  behold  behold i am thy servant  disarms me at once of the powers of a master    thou shall go la fleur said i   and what mistress la fleur said i can thou have picked up in so little a time at paris la fleur laid his hand upon his breast and said twas a petite demoiselle at monsieur le count de bs  la fleur had a heart made for society and to speak the truth of him let as few occasions slip him as his master  so that some how or other  but how  heaven knows  he had connected himself with the demoiselle upon the landing of the staircase during the time i was taken up with my passport and as there was time enough for me to win the count to my interest la fleur had contrived to make it do to win the maid to his  the family it seems was to be at paris that day and he had made a party with her and two or three

virtues the sport of contingencies  or one man may be generous as another man is puissant  sed non quo ad hanc  or be it as it may  for there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humors they may depend upon the same causes for aught i know which influence the tides themselves  twould often be no discredit to us to suppose it was so i am sure at least for myself that in many a case i should be more highly satisfied to have it said by the world i had had an affair with the moon in which there was neither sin nor shame than have it pass altogether as my own act and deed wherein there was so much of both   but be this as it may the moment i cast my eyes upon him i was predetermined not to give him a single sous and accordingly i put my purse into my pocket  buttoned it up  set myself a little more upon my center and advanced up gravely to him there was something i fear forbidding in my look i have his figure this moment before my eyes and think there was that in it which deserved better  the monk as i judged from the break in his tonsure a few scattered white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of it might be about seventy  but from his eyes and that sort of fire that was in them which seemed more tempered by courtesy than years could be no more than sixty  truth might lie between  he was certainly sixtyfive and the general air of his countenance notwithstanding something seemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time agreed to the account  it was one of those heads which guido has often painted  mild pale  penetrating free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented ignorance looking downwards upon the earth  it looked forwards but looked as if it looked at something beyond this world how one of his order came by it heaven above who let it fall upon a monks shoulders best knows but it would have suited a bramin and had i met it upon the plains of indostan i had reverenced it  the rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes one might put it into the hands of any one to design for twas neither elegant or otherwise but as character and expression made it so it was a thin spare form something above the common size if it lost not the distinction by a bend forward in the figure  but it was the attitude of entreaty and as it now stands present to my imagination it gained more than it lost by it  when he had entered the room three paces he stood still and laying his left hand upon his breast a slender white staff with which he journeyd being in his right  when i had got close up to him he introduced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent and the poverty of his order  and did it with so simple a grace  and such an air of deprecation was there in the whole cast of his look and figure  i was bewitched not to have been struck with it   a better reason was i had predetermined not to give him a single sous   it is very true said i replying to a cast upwards with his eyes with which he had concluded his address  it is very true  and heaven be their resource who have no other but the charity of the world the stock of which i fear is no way sufficient for the many great claims which are hourly made upon it  as i pronounced the words great claims he gave a slight glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve of his tunick  i felt the full force of the appeal  i acknowledge it said i  a coarse habit and that but once in three years with meagre diet  are no great matters and the true point of pity is as they can be earned in the world with so little industry that your order should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the lame the blind the aged and the infirm  the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions languishes also for his share of it and had you been of the order of mercy instead of the order of st francis poor as i am continued i pointing at my portmanteau full cheerfully should it have been opened to you for the ransom of the unfortunate  the monk made me a bow  but of all others resumed i the unfortunate of our own country surely have the first rights and i have left thousands in distress upon our own shore  the monk gave a cordial wave with his head  as much as to say no doubt there is misery enough in every corner of the world as well as within our convent  but we distinguish said i laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunick in return for his appeal  we distinguish my good father betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labor  and those who eat the bread of other peoples and have no other plan in life but to get through it in sloth and ignorance for the love of god  the poor franciscan made no reply a hectic of a moment passed across his cheek but could not tarry  nature seemed to have had done with her resentments in him he showed none  but letting his staff fall within his arm he pressed both his hands with resignation upon his breast and retired  my heart smote me the moment he shut the door  psha said i with an air of carelessness three several times  but it would not do every ungracious syllable i had uttered crowded back into my imagination i reflected i had no right over the poor franciscan but to deny him and that the punishment of that was enough to the dissappointed without the addition of unkind language  i considered his gray hairs  his courteous figure seemed to reenter and gently ask me what injury he had done me  and why i could use him thus  i would have given twenty livres for an advocate  i have behaved very ill said i within myself but i have only just set out upon my travels and shall learn better manners as i get along  sen jour p   the monk the good old monk was within six paces of us as the idea of him crossed my mind and was advancing toward us a little out of the line as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no  he stopped however as soon as he came up to us with a world of frankness and having a horn snuff box in his hand he presented it open to me  you shall taste mine  said i pulling out my box which was a small tortoise one and putting it into his hand  it is most excellent said the monk then do me the favor i replied to accept of the box and all and when you take a pinch out of it sometimes recollect it was the peace offering of a man who once used you unkindly but not from his heart  the poor monk blushed as red as scarlet mon dieu said he pressing his hands together  you never used me unkindly  i should think said the lady he is not likely i blushed in my turn but from what movements i leave to the few who feel to analyze  excuse me madame replied i  i treated him most unkindly and from no provocations it is impossible said the lady  my god cried the monk with a warmth of asseveration which seemed not to belong to him  the fault was in me and in the indiscretion of my zeal  the lady opposed it and i joined with her in maintaining it was impossible that a spirit so regulated as his could give offense to any  i knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as i then felt it  we remained silent without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one anothers faces without saying a word whilst this lasted the monk rubbed his hornbox upon the sleeve of his tunick and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the friction  he made a low bow and said twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contest  but be it as it would  he begged we might exchange boxes  in saying this he presented his to me with one hand as he took mine from me in the other and having kissed it  with a stream of goodnature in his eyes he put it into his bosom  and took his leave  i guard this box as i would the instrumental parts of my religion to help my mind on to something better in truth i seldom go abroad without it and often and many a time have i called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own in the justlings of the world they had found full employment for his as i learnt from his story till about the fortyfifth year of his age when upon some military services ill requited and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest of passions he abandoned the sword and the sex together and took sanctuary not so much in his convent as in himself  i feel a damp upon my spirits as i am going to add that in my last return through calais upon inquiring after father lorenzo i heard he had been dead near three months and was buried not in his convent but according to his desire in a little cemetery belonging to it about two leagues off i had a strong desire to see where they had laid him  when upon pulling out his little horn box as i sat by his grave and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it which had no business to grow there they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections that i burst into a flood of tears  but i am as weak as a woman and i beg the world not to smile but pity me  s journey page    fellowfeeling there is something in our nature which engages us to take part in every accident to which man is subject from what cause soever it may have happened but in such calamities as a man has fallen into through mere misfortune to be charged upon no fault or indiscretion of himself there is something then so truly interesting that at the first sight we generally make them our own not altogether from a reflection that they might have been or may be so but oftener from a certain generosity and tenderness of nature which disposes us for compassion abstracted from all considerations of self so that without any observable act of the will we suffer with the unfortunate and feel a weight upon our spirits we know not why on seeing the most common instances of their distress but where the spectacle is uncommonly tragical and complicated with many circumstances of misery the mind is then taken captive at once and were it inclined to it has no power to make resistance but surrenders itself to all the tender emotions of pity and deep concern so that when one considers this friendly part of our nature without looking farther one would think it impossible for man to look upon misery without finding himself in some measure attached to the interest of him who suffers it  i say one would think it impossible  for there are some tempers  how shall i describe them  formed either of such impenetrable matter or wrought up by habitual selfishness to such an utter insensibility of what becomes of the fortunes of their fellow creatures as if they were not partakers of the same nature or had no lot or connection at all with the species  sermon iii p    the unmerciful man look into the world  how often do you behold a sordid wretch whose strait heart is open to no mans affliction taking shelter behind an appearance of piety and putting on the garb of religion which none but the merciful and compassionate have a title to wear take notice with what sanctity he goes to the end of his days in the same selfish track in which he at first set out  turning neither to the right hand nor to the left  but plods on  pores all his life long upon the ground as if afraid to look up lest peradventure he should see aught which might turn him one moment out of that strait line where interest is carrying him  or if by chance he stumbles upon a hapless object of distress which threatens such a disaster to him  devou passing by on the other side as if unwilling to  himself to the impressions of nature or  the inconveniences which pity might lead him into upon the occasion  sermon iii p    pity in benevolent natures the impulse to pity is so sudden that like instruments of music which obey the touch  the objects which are fitted to excite such impressions work so instantaneous an effect that you would think the will was scarce concerned and that the mind was altogether passive in the sympathy which her own goodness has excited the truth is  the soul is generally in such cases so busily taken up and wholly engrossed by the object of pity that she does not attend to her own operations or take leisure to examine the principles upon which she acts  sermon iii page    compassion in generous spirits compassion is sometimes more than a balance for self preservation god certainly interwove that friendly softness in our nature to be a check upon too great a propensity toward selflove  sermon v page    slander of the many revengeful covetous false and illnatured persons which we complain of in the world though we all join in the cry against them what man amongst us singles out himself as a criminal or ever once takes it into his head that he adds to the number  or where is there a man so bad who would not think it the hardest and most unfair imputation to have any of those particular vices laid to his charge  if he has the symptoms never so strong upon him which he would pronounce infallible in another they are indications of no such malady in himself  he sees what no one else sees some secret and flattering circumstances in his favor which no doubt make a wide difference betwixt his case and the parties which he condemns  what other man speaks so often and vehemently against the vice of pride sets the weakness of it in a more odious light or is more hurt with it in another than the proud man himself it is the same with the passionate the designing the ambitious and some other common characters in life and being a consequence of the nature of such vices and almost inseparable from them the effects of it are generally so gross and absurd that where pity does not forbid it is pleasant to observe and trace the cheat through the several turnings and windings of the heart and detect it through all the shapes and appearances which it puts on  sermon iv p    house of mourning let us go into the house of mourning made so by such afflictions as have been brought in merely by the common cross accidents and disasters to which our condition is exposed  where perhaps the aged parents sit brokenhearted pierced to their souls with the folly and indiscretion of a thankless child  the child of their prayers in whom all their hopes and expectations centered  perhaps a more affecting scene  a virtuous family lying pinched with want where the unfortunate support of it having long struggled with a train of misfortunes and bravely fought up against them  is now piteously borne down at the last  overwhelmed with a cruel blow which no forecast or frugality could have prevented  o god look upon his afflictions  behold him distracted with many sorrows surrounded with the tender pledges of his love and the partner of his cares  without bread to give them unable from the remembrance of better days to dig  to beg ashamed  when we enter into the house of mourning such as this  it is impossible to insult the unfortunate even with an improper look  under whatever levity and dissipation of heart such objects catch our eyes  they catch likewise our attentions collect and call home our scattered thoughts and exercise them with wisdom a transient scene of distress such as is here sketched how soon does it furnish materials to set the mind at work how necessarily does it engage it to the consideration of the miseries and misfortunes the dangers and calamities to which the life of man is subject by holding up such a glass before it it forces the mind to see and reflect upon the vanity  the perishing condition and uncertain tenure of every thing in this world from reflections of this serious cast how insensibly do the thoughts carry us farther  and from considering what we are  what kind of world we live in and what evils befall us in it how naturally do they set us to look forwards at what possibly we shall be  for what kind of world we are intended  what evils may befall us there  and what provision we should make against them here whilst we have time and opportunity if these lessons are so inseparable from the house of mourning here supposed  we shall find it a still more instructive school of wisdom when we take a view of the place in that more affecting light in which the wise man seems to confine it in the text in which by the house of mourning i believe he means that particular scene of sorrow where there is lamentation and mourning for the dead turn in hither i beseech you for a moment behold a dead man ready to be carried out the only son of his mother and she a widow perhaps a more affecting spectacle a kind and indulgent father of a numerous family lies breathless  snatched away in the strength of his age  torn in an evil hour from his children and the bosom of a disconsolate wife behold much people of the city gathered together to mix their tears with settled sorrow in their looks going heavily along to the house of mourning to perform that last melancholy office which when the debt of nature is paid we are called upon to pay to each other if this sad occasion which leads him there has not done it already take notice to what a serious and devout frame of mind every man is reduced the moment he enters this gate of affliction the busy and fluttering spirits which in the house of mirth were wont to transport him from one diverting object to another  see how they are fallen how peaceably they are laid in this gloomy mansion full of shades and uncomfortable damps to sieze the soul  see the light and easy heart which never knew what it was to think before how pensive it is now how soft how susceptible how full of religious impressions how deeply it is smitten with sense and with a love of virtue could we in this crisis whilst this empire of reason and religion lasts and the heart is thus exercised with wisdom and busied with heavenly contemplations  could we see it naked as it is  stripped of its passions unspotted by the world and regardless of its pleasures  we might then safely rest our cause upon this single evidence and appeal to the most sensual whether solomon has not made a just determination here in favor of the house of mourning not for its own sake but as it is fruitful in virtue and becomes the occasion of so much good without this end sorrow i own has no use but to shorten a mans days  nor can gravity with all its studied solemnity of look and carriage serve any end but to make one half of the world merry and impose upon the other  sermon ii p    frailty the best of men appear sometimes to be strange compounds of contradictory qualities and were the accidental oversights and folly of the wisest man  the failings and imperfections of a religious man  the hasty acts and passionate words of a meek man  were they to rise up in judgment against them  and an

ever awed the world have experienced what the turn of the wheel can do  that which has happened to one man may befall another and therefore that excellent rule of our saviors ought to govern us in all

misadventure the man seemed to lament it much and it instantly brought into my mind sanchos lamentation for his but he did it with more true touches of nature  the mourner was sitting upon a stonebench at the door with the asss panel and its bridle on one side which he took up from time to time  then laid them down  looked at them  and shook his head he then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again as if to eat it held it some time in his hand  then laid it upon the bit of his asss bridle  looked wistfully at the little arrangement he had made  and then gave a sigh  the simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him and la fleur amongst the rest whilst the horses were getting ready as i continued sitting in the postchaise i could see and hear over their heads   he said he had come last from spain where he had been from the furthest borders of franconia and had got so far on his return home when his ass died every one seemed desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home  it had pleased heaven he said to bless him with three sons the finest lads in all germany but having in one week lost two of them by the smallpox and the youngest falling ill of the same distemper he was afraid of being berest of them all and made a vow if heaven would not take him from him also he would go in gratitude to st jago in spain  when the mourner got thus far on his story he stopped to pay nature her tribute  and wept bitterly  he said heaven had accepted the conditions and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor creature who had been a patient partner of his journey  that it had eat the same bread with him all the way and was unto him as a friend  every body who stood about heard the poor fellow with concern  la fleur offered him money  the mourner said he did not want it  it was not the value of the ass  but the loss of him  the ass he said he was assured loved him  and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the pyrenean mountains which had separated them from each other three days during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass and that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met  thou have one comfort friend said i at least in the loss of thy poor beast i am sure thou have been a merciful master to him  alas said the mourner i thought so when he was alive  but now he is dead i think otherwise  i fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for him  they have shortened the poor creatures days and i fear i have them to answer for  shame on the world said i to myself  did we love each other as this poor soul but loved his ass  twould be something  sen journey p    humouring immoral appetites the humouring of certain appetites where morality is not concerned seems to be the means by which the author of nature intended to sweeten this journey of life  and bear us up under the many shocks and hard jostlings which we are sure to meet with in our way  and a man might with as much reason musfle up himself against sunshine and fair weather  and at othertimes expose himself naked to the inclemencies of cold and rain as debar himself of the innocent delights of his nature for affected reserve and melancholy  it is true on the other hand our passions are apt to grow upon us by indulgence and become exorbitant if they are not kept under exact discipline that by way of caution and prevention twere better at certain times to affect some degree of needless reserve than hazard any ill consequences from the other extreme  sermon xxxvii p    unity look into private life  behold how good and pleasant a thing it is to live together in unity  it is like the precious

principles and conduct in wishing to continue the war written to his brother i am not insensible brother shandy that when a man whose profession is arms wishes as i have done for war  it has an ill aspect to the world  and that how just and right soever his motives and intentions may be  he stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from private views in doing it  for this cause if a soldier is a prudent man which he may be without being a jot the less brave he will be sure not to utter his wish in the hearing of an enemy for say what he will an enemy will not believe him  he will be cautious of doing it even to a friend  lest he may suffer in his esteem  but if his heart is overcharged and a secret sigh for arms must have its vent he will reserve it for the ear of a brother who knows his character to the bottom and what his true notions dispositions and principles of honor are what i hope i have been in all these brother shandy would be unbecoming in me to say  much worse i know have i been than i ought  and something worse perhaps than i think but such as i am you my dear brother shandy who have sucked the same breasts with me  and with whom i have been brought up from my cradle  and from whose knowledge from the first hours of of our boyish pastimes down to this i have concealed no one action of my life and scarce a thought in it  such as i am brother you must by this time know me with all my vices and with all my weaknesses too whether of my age my temper my passions or my understanding  tell me then my dear brother shandy upon which of them it is that when i condemned the peace of utrecht and grieved the war was not carried on with vigor a little longer you should think your brother did it upon unworthy views or that in wishing for war he should be bad enough to wish more of his fellow creatures slain  more slaves made and more families driven from their peaceful habitations merely for his own pleasure  tell me brother shandy upon what one deed of mine do you ground it  if when i was a schoolboy i could not hear a drum beat but my heart beat with it  was it my fault did i plant the propensity there did i sound the alarm within or nature  when guy earl of warwick and parismus and parismenus and valentine and orson and the seven champions of england were handed around the school  were they not all purchased with my own pocket money was that selfish brother shandy when we read over the siege of troy which lasted ten years and eight months  though with such a train of artillery as we had at namur the town might have been carried in a week  was i not as much concerned for the greeks and trojans as any boy of the whole school had i not three strokes of a ferula given me two on my right hand and one on my left for calling helena a bitch for it did any one of you shed more tears for hector and when king priam came to the camp to beg his body and returned weeping back to troy without it  you know brother i could not eat my dinner   did that bespeak me cruel or because brother shandy my blood flew out into the camp and my heart panted for war  was it a proof it could not ache for the distresses of war too  o brother it is one thing for a soldier to gather laurels  and it is another to scatter cypress   it is one thing brother shandy for a soldier to hazard his own life  to leap first down into the trench where he is sure to be cut in pieces  it is one thing from public spirit and a thirst of glory to enter the breach the first man  to stand in the foremost rank and march bravely on with drums and trumpets and colors flying about his ears  it is one thing i say brother shandy to do this  and it is another thing to reflect on the miseries of war  to view the desolations of whole countries and consider the intolerable fatigues and hardships which the soldier himself the instrument who works them is forced for sixpence a day if he can get it to undergo  need i be told dear yorick as i was by you in le fevers funeral sermon that so soft and gentle a creature born to love to mercy and kindness as man is was not shaped for this but why did you not add yorick  if not by nature  that he is so by necessity  for what is war what is it yorick when fought as ours has been upon principles of liberty and upon principles of honor  what is it but the getting together of quiet and harmless people with their swords in their hands to keep the ambitious and the turbulent within bounds and heaven is my witness brother shandy that the pleasure i have taken in these things  and that infinite delight in particular which has attended my sieges in my bowling green has arose within me and i hope in the corporal too from the consciousness we both had that in carrying them on we were answering the

mixed up so kindly within him my uncle toby had scarce a hear to retaliate upon a fly  go  says he one day at dinner to an overgrown one which had buzzed about his nose and tormented him cruelly all dinnertime  and which after infinite attempts he had caught at last  as it flew by him  i will not hurt thee says my uncle toby rising from his chair and going across the room with the fly in his hand

and not of a man which holds you in it  the evil vanishes and you bear the other half without complaint  i was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy with a voice which i took to be of a child which complained it could not get out  i looked up and down the passage and seeing neither man woman or child i went out without further attention  in my return back through the passage i heard the same words repeated twice over and looking up i saw it was a starling hung in a little cage  i cannot get out  i cannot get out said the starling  i stood looking at the bird and to every person who came through the passage it ran fluttering to the side toward which they approached it with the same lamentations of its captivity  i cannot get out said the starling  god help thee said i but i will let thee out cost what it will so i turned about the cage to get the door it was twisted and double twisted so fast with wire there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to pieces  i took both hands to it  the bird flew to the place where i was attempting his deliverance and thrusting his head through the trellis pressed his breast against it as if impatient  i fear poor creature said i i cannot set thee at liberty  no said the starling  i cannot get out  i cannot get out said the starling  i vow i never had my affections more tenderly awakened nor do i remember an incident in my life where the dissipated spirits to which my reason had been a bubble were so suddenly called home mechanical as the notes were yet so true in tune to nature were they chanted that in one moment they overthrew all my systematic reasonings upon the bastile and i heavily walked up stairs unsaying every word i had said in going down them  disguise thyself as thou will still slavery said i  still thou art a bitter draught and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of thee thou art no less bitter on that account  it is thou thrice sweet and gracious goddess addressing myself to liberty whom all in public or in private worship whose taste grateful and ever will be so till nature herself shall change  no tint of words can spot thy snowy mantle or chymic power turn thy scepter into iron  with thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust the swain is happier than his monarch from whose court thou art exiled  gracious heaven cried i kneeling down upon the last step but one in my ascent  grant me but health thou great bestower of it and give me but this fair goddess as my companion  and shower down thy mitres if it seems good unto thy divine providence upon those heads which are aching for them  sent journey p     the captive the bird in his cage pursued me into my room i sat down close by my table and leaning my head upon my hand i began to figure to myself the miseries of confinement i was in a right frame for it and so i gave full scope to my imagination  i was going to begin with the millions of my fellow creatures born to no inheritance but slavery but finding however affecting the picture was that i could not bring it near me and that the multitude of sad groups in it did but distract me    i took a single captive and having first shut him up in his dungeon i then looked through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture  i beheld his body half wasted away with long expectation and confinement and felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope deferred upon looking nearer i saw him pale and feverish in thirty years the western breeze had not once fanned his blood  he had seen no sun no moon in all that time  nor had the voice of friend or kinsman breathed through his lattice  his children    but here my heart began to bleed  and i was forced to go on with another part of the portrait  he was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw in the furthest corner of his dungeon which was alternately his chair and bed a little calendar of small sticks were laid at the head notchd all over with the dismal days and nights he had passed there  he had one of these little sticks in his hand and with a rusty nail he was etching another day of misery to add to the heap as i darkened the little light he had he lifted up a hopeless eye toward the door then cast it down  shook his head and went on with his work of affliction i heard his chains upon his legs as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle  he gave a deep sigh  i saw the iron enter into his soul  i burst into tears  i could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn  sent journey p     the dwarf i was walking down that which leads from the carousal to the palais royal and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter which ran down the middle of it i took hold of his hand and helped him over upon turning up his face to look at him after i perceived he was about forty  never mind said i some good body will do as much for me when i am ninety  i feel some little principles within me which incline me to be merciful toward this poor blighted part of my species who have neither size or strength to get on in the world  i cannot bear to see one of them trod upon and had scarce got seated beside an old french officer at the opera comique ere the disgust was exercised by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in  at the end of the orchestra and betwixt that and the first sidebox there is a small esplenade left where when the house is full numbers of all ranks take sanctuary though you stand as in the parterre you pay the same price as in the orchestra a poor defenseless being of this order had got thrust somehow or other into this luckless place  the night was hot and he was surrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than himself the dwarf suffered inexpressibly on all sides but the thing which incommoded him most was a tall corpulent german near seven feet high who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of seeing either the stage or the actors the poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards by seeking for some little opening betwixt the germans arm and his body trying first one side then the other but the german stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imagined   the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest drawwell in paris so he civilly reached up his hand to the germans sleeve and told him his distress   the german turned his head back looked down upon him as goliath did upon david  and unfeelingly resumed his posture  i was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monks little horn box  and how would thy meek and courteous spirit my dear monk so tempered to bear and forbear  how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor souls complaint  the old french officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion as i made the apostrophe took the liberty to ask me what was the matter  i told him the story in three words and added how inhuman it was  by this time the dwarf was driven to extremes and in his first transports which are generally unreasonable had told the german he would cut off his long queue with his knife  the german looked back coolly and told him he was welcome if he could reach it  an injury sharpened by an insult be it to who it will makes every man of sentiment a party i could have leaped out of the box to have redressed it  the old french officer did it with much less confusion for leaning a little over and modding to a sentinel and pointing at the same time with his finger to the distress  the sentinel made his way up to it  there was no occasion to tell the grievance  the thing told itself so thrusting back the german instantly with his musket  he took the poor dwarf by the hand and placed him before him  this is noble said i clapping my hands together  and yet you would not permit this said the old officer in england   in england dear sir said i we sit all at our ease  the old french officer would have set me at unity with myself in case i had been at variance  by saying it was a bon mot  and as a bon mot is always worth something at paris he offered me a pinch of snuff  sent journey p     charity when all is ready and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn unless you are a little sourd by the adventure there is always a matter to compound at the door before you can get into your chaise and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty who surround you let no man say let them go to the devil  it is a cruel journey to send a few miserables and they have had sufferings enough without it i always think it better to take a few sous out in my hand and i would counsel every gentle traveller to do so likewise he need not be so exact in setting down his motives for giving them  they will be registered elsewhere  for my own part there is no man gives so little as i do for few that i know have so little to give but as this was the first public act of my charity in france i took the more notice of it  a wellaway said i i have but eight sous in the world showing them in my hand and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for em  a poor tattered soul without a shirt on instantly withdrew his claim by retiring two steps out of the circle and making a disqualifying bow on his part had the whole parterre cried out place aux dames with one voice it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the effect  just heaven for what wise reasons have thou ordered it that beggary and urbanity which are at such variance in other countries should find a way to be at unity in this   i insisted upon presenting him with a single sous merely for his politesse  a poor little dwarfish brisk fellow who stood over against me in the circle putting something first under his arm which had once been a hat took his snuff box out of his pocket and generously offered a pinch on both sides of him it was a gift of consequence and modestly declined  the poor little fellow pressed it upon them with a nod of welcomeness  prenez en  prenez said he looking another way so they each took a pinch  pity thy box should ever want one said i to myself so i put a couple of sous into it  taking a small pinch out of his box to enhance their value as i did it  he felt the weight of the second obligation more than that of the first  twas doing him an honor  the other was only doing him a charity  and he made me a bow down to the ground for it   here said i to an old soldier with one hand who had been compaignd and worn out to death in the service  here is a couple of sous for thee vive le roi said the old soldier  i had then but three sous left so i gave one simply pour lamour de dieu which was the footing on which it was begged  the poor woman had a dislocated hip so it could not be well upon any other motive  mon cher et tres charitable monsieur  there is no opposing this said i  my lord anglois  the very sound was worth the money  so i gave my last sous for it but in the eagerness of giving i had overlooked a pauvre honteux who had no one to ask a sous for him and who i believed would have perished ere he could have asked one for himself he stood by the chaise a little without the circle and wiped a tear from a face which i thought had seen better days  good god said i  and i have not one single sous left to give him  but you have a thousand cried all the powers of nature stirring within me  so i gave him  no matter what  i am ashamed to say how much now  and was ashamed to think how little then so if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition as these two fixed points are given him he may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum  i could afford nothing for the rest but dieu vous benisse  et le bon dieu vous benisse encore  said the old soldier the dwarf etc the pauvre honteux could say nothing  he pulled out a little handkerchief and wiped his face as he turned away  and i thought he thanked me more than them all  sent journey p    reflections on death the corporal    tread lightly on his ashes ye men of genius  for he was your kinsman  weed his grave clean

history of the romish church and her tyrants or rather executioners who seem to have taken pleasure in the pangs and convulsions of their fellow creatures  examine the inquisition hear the melancholy notes sounded in every cell  consider the anguish of mock trials and the exquisite tortures consequent thereupon mercilessly inflicted upon the unfortunate where the racked and weary soul has so often

you last  but why is my pen so perverse i have been to  and my errand was of so peculiar a nature that i must give you an account of it  you will scarce believe me when i tell you it was to outjuggle a juggling attorney to put craft and all its power to defiance and to obtain justice from one  who has a heart foul enough to take advantage of the mistakes of honest simplicity and who has raised a considerable fortune by artifice and injustice however i gained my point  it was a star and garter to me  the matter was as follows   a poor man the father of my vestal having by the sweat of his brow during a course of many laborious years saved a small sum of money applied to this scribe to put it out to use for him this was done and a bond given for the money  the honest man having no place in his cottage which he thought sufficiently secure put it in a hole in the thatch which had served instead of a strong box to keep his money  in this situation the bond remained till the time of receiving his interest drew nigh  but alas  the rain which had done no mischief to his gold had found out his papersecurity and had rotted it to pieces  it would be a difficult matter to paint the distress of the old countryman upon this discovery  le came to me weeping and begged my advice and assistance  it cut me to the heart  frame to yourself the picture of a man upwards of sixty years of age  who having with much penury and more toil with the addition of a small legacy scraped together about fourscore pounds to support him in the infirmities of old age and to be a little portion for his child when he should be dead and gone  lost his little hoard ot once and to aggravate his misfortune by his own neglect and incaution  if i was young sir said he my affliction would have been light  and i might have obtained it again  but i have lost my comfort when i most wanted it  my staff is taken from me when i cannot go alone and i have nothing to expect in future life but the unwilling charity of a parishofficer  never in my whole life did i wish to be rich with so good a grace as at this time  what a luxury would it have been to have said to this afflicted fellow creature  there is thy money  go thy ways  and be at peace  but alas the shandy family were never much encumbered with money and i the poorest of them all could only assist him with good council  but i did not stop here  i went myself with him to  where by persuasion threats and some art which by the bye in such a cause and with such an opponent was very justifiable  i sent my poor client back to his home with his comfort and his bond restored to him  bravo  bravo  if a man has a right to be proud of any thing  it is of a good action done as it ought to be without any base interest lurking at the bottom of it  letter vi to his friends a subject for compassion if there is a case under heaven which calls out aloud for the more immediate exercise of compassion and which may be looked upon as the compendium of all charity surely it is this and i am persuaded there would want nothing more to convince the greatest enemy to these kind of charities that it is so but a bare opportunity of taking a nearer view of some of the more distressful objects of it  let him go into the dwellings of the unfortunate into some mournful cottage where poverty and affliction reign together there let him behold the disconsolate widow  sitting  steeped in tears  thus sorrowing over the infant she knows not how to succor  o my child thou art now left exposed to a wide and a vicious world too full of snares and temptations for thy tender and unpractised age perhaps a parents love may magnify those dangers  but when i consider thou art driven out naked into the midst of them without friends without fortune without instruction my heart bleeds beforehand for the evils which may come upon thee god in whom we trusted is witness so low had his providence placed us that we never indulged one wish to have made thee rich  virtuous we would have made thee  for thy father my husband was a good man and feared the lord  and though all the fruits of his care and industry were little enough for our support yet he honestly had determined to have spared some portion of it scanty as it was to have placed thee safely in the way of knowledge and instruction  but alas he is gone from us never to return more and with him are fled the means of doing it  for behold the creditor is come upon us to take all that we have grief is eloquent and will not easily be imitated  but let the man who is the least friend to distresses of this nature conceive some disconsolate widow uttering her complaint even in this manner and then let him consider if there is any sorrow like this sorrow wherewith the lord has afflicted her or whether there can be any charity like that of taking the child out of the mothers bosom and rescuing her from these apprehensions should a heathen a stranger to our holy religion and the love it teached should he as he journeyed come to the place where she lay when he saw would he not have compassion on her god forbid a christian should this day want it or at any time look upon such a distress and pass by on the other side rather let him do as his savior taught him bind up the wounds and pour comfort into the heart of one whom the hand of god has so bruised let him practice what it is with elijahs transport to say to the afflicted widow  see thy son lives lives by my charity and the bounty of this hour to all the purposes which make life desirable  to be made a good man and a profitable subject on one hand to be trained up to such a sense of his duty as may secure him an interest in the world to come and with regard to this world to be so brought up in it to a love of

life must be performed with more equal vigor and freedom in that man whom a great and good soul perpetually inclines to show mercy to the miserable than they can be in a poor sordid selfish wretch whose little contracted heart melts at no mans affliction but sits brooding so intently over its own plots and concerns as to see and feel nothing and in truth enjoy nothing beyond himself and of whom one may say what that great master of nature has speaking of a natural sense of harmony which i think with more justice may be said of compassion that the man who had it not   was fit for treasons

it is the first and strongest desire of his nature  in every stage of his life he searches for it as for hid treasure  courts it under a thousand different shapes  and though perpetually disappointed  still persists  runs after and enquires for it afresh  asks every passenger who comes in his way who will show him any good who will assist him in the attainment of it or direct him to the discovery of this great end of all his wishes  he is told by one to search for it among the more gay and youthful pleasures of life in scenes of mirth and sprightliness where happiness ever presides and is ever to be known by the joy and laughter which he will see at once painted in her looks a second with a graver aspect points out to the costly dwellings which pride and extravagance have erected  tells the enquirer that the object he is in search of inhabits there  that happiness lives only in company with the great in the midst of much pomp and outward state that he will easily find her out by the coat of many colors she has on and the great luxury and expense of equipage and furniture with which she always sits surrounded  the miser blesses god  wonders how any one would mislead and wilfully put him upon so wrong a scent  convinces him that happiness and extravagance never inhabited under the same roof  that if he would not be disappointed in his search he must look into the plain and thrifty dwelling of the prudent man who knows and understands the worth of money and cautiously lays it up against an evil hour that it is not the prostitution of wealth upon the passions or the parting with it at all that constitutes happiness  but that it is the keeping it together and the having and holding it fast to him and his heirs for ever which are the chief attributes that form this great idol of human worship to which so much incense is offered up every day  the epicure though he easily rectifies so gross a mistake yet at the same time he plunges him if possible into a greater for hearing the object of his pursuit to be happiness and knowing of no other happiness than what is seated immediately in his senses  he sends the enquirer there  tells him it is in vain to search elsewhere for it than where nature herself has placed it  in the indulgence and gratification of the appetites which are given us for that end and in a word  if he will not take his opinion in the matter  he may trust the word of a much wiser man who has assured us  that there is nothing better in this world than that a man should eat and drink and rejoice in his works and make his soul enjoy good in his labor  for that is his portion  to rescue him from this brutal experiment  ambition takes him by the hand and carries him into the world  shows him all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them  points out the many ways of advancing his fortune and raising himself to honor  lays before his eyes all the charms and bewitching temptations of power and asks if there can be any happiness in this world like that of being caressed courted flattered and followed  to close all the philosopher meets him bustling in the full career of this pursuit  stops him  tells him if he is in search of happiness he is far gone out of his way that this deity has long been banished from noise and tumults where there was no rest found for her and was fled into folitude far from all commerce of the world and in a word if he would find her he must leave this busy and intriguing scene and go back to that peaceful scene of retirement and books from which he first set out  in this circle too often does a man run tries all experiments and generally sits down wearied and dissatisfied with them all at last  in utter despair of ever accomplishing what he wants  nor knowing what to trust to after so many disappointments or where to lay the fault whether in the incapacity of his own nature or in the insufficiency of the enjoyments themselves  sermon i p i tribute of affection my heart stops me to

crosses in life many many are the ups and downs of life and fortune must be uncommonly gracious to that mortal who does not experience a great variety of them  though perhaps to these may be owing as much of our pleasures as our pains there are scenes of delight in the vale as well as the mountain and the inequalities of nature may not be less necessary to please the eye  than the varieties of life to improve the heart at best we are but a shortsighted race of beings with just light enough to discern our way  to do that is our duty and should be our care when a man has done this he is safe the rest is of little consequence    cover his head with a turf or a stone  it is all one it is all one letter iv to his friends the contrast things are carried on in this world sometimes so contrary to all our reasonings and the seeming probabilities of success  that even the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong  nay what is stranger still  nor yet bread to the wise who should last stand in want of it  nor yet riches to the men of understanding who you would think best qualified to acquire them  nor yet favor to men of skill whose merit and pretenses bid the fairest for it  but that there are some secret and unseen workings in human affairs which baffle all our endeavors and turn aside the course of things in such a manner  that the most likely causes disappoint and fail of producing for us the effect which we wished and naturally expected from them  you will see a man of whom was you to form a conjecture from the appearances of things in his favor  you would say was setting out in the world with the fairest prospect of making his fortune in it  with all the advantages of birth to recommend him  of personal merit to speak for him  and of friends to push him forwards you will behold him notwithstanding this disappointed in every effect you might naturally have looked for from them every step he takes toward his advancement something invisible shall pull him back some unforeseen obstacle shall rise up perpetually in his way and keep there  in every application he makes  some untoward circumstance shall blast it  he shall rise early  late take rest  and eat the bread of carefulness  yet some happier man shall still rise up and ever step in before him and leave him struggling to the end of his life in the very same place in which he first began it  the history of a second shall in all respects be the contrast to this he shall come into the world with the most unpromising appearance  shall set forwards without fortune without friends  without talents to procure him either the one or the other nevertheless you will see this clouded prospect brighten up insensibly unaccountably before him every thing presented in his way shall turn out beyond his expectations in spite of that chain of unsurmountable difficulties which first threatened him  time and chance shall open him a way  a series of successful occurrences shall lead him by the hand to the summit of honor and fortune and in a word without giving him the pains of thinking or the credit of projecting it shall place him in a safe possession of all that ambition could wish for  sermon viii page     selfishness and meanness that there is selfishness and meanness enough in the souls of one part of the world to hurt the credit of the other part of it is what i shall not dispute against but to judge of the whole from this bad sample and because one man is plotting and artful in his nature  or a second openly makes his pleasure or his profit the whole center of all his designs  or because a third straithearted wretch sits confined within himself  feels no misfortunes but those which touch himself to involve the whole race without mercy under such detested characters is a conclusion as false as it is pernicious and was it in general to gain credit could serve no end but the rooting out of our nature all that is generous and planting in the stead of it such an aversion to each other as must untie the bands of society and rob us of one of the greatest pleasures of it the mutual communications of kind offices and by poisoning the fountain rendering every thing suspected that flows through it  sermon vii page     vice not without use the lives of bad men are not without use  and whenever such a one is drawn not with a corrupt view to be admired  but on purpose to be detested  it must excite such a horror against vice as will strike indirectly the same good impression and though it is painful to the last degree to paint a man in the shades which his vices have cast upon him yet when it serves this end it carries its own excuse with it  sermon ix page     effects of misfortune what by successive misfortunes by failings and cross accidents in trade by miscarriage of projects  what by unsuitable expenses of parents extravagances of children and the many other secret ways whereby riches make themselves wings and fly away so many surprising revolutions do every day happen in families that it may not seem strange to say that the posterity of some of the most liberal contributors here in the changes which one century may produce may possibly find shelter under this very plant which now they so kindly water nay so quickly sometimes has the wheel turned round that many a man has lived to enjoy the benefit of that charity which his own piety projected  sermon v page    yoricks opinion of gravity sometimes in his wild way of talking he would say that gravity was an errant scoundrel and he would add of the most dangerous kind too  because a sly one and that he verily believed more honest wellmeaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelvemonth than by pocketpicking and shoplifting in seven in the naked temper which a merry heart discovered he would say there was no danger  but to itself  whereas the very essence of gravity was design and consequently deceit  twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth and that with all its pretensions  it was no better but often worse than what a french wit had long ago defined it viz  a mysterious

many causes of trouble  when i consider how often we eat the bread of affliction and that we are born to it as to the portion of our inheritance  when one runs over the catalogue of all the cross

by many a peripateric philosopher that nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumscribe the discontent of man she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease and to sustain his sufferings at home it is there only that she has provided him with the most suitable objects to partake of his happiness and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages has ever been too heavy for one pair of shoulders it is true we are endued with an imperfect power of spreading our happiness sometimes beyond her limits but it is so ordered that from the want of languages connections and dependencies and from the difference in education customs and habits we lie under so many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own sphere as often amount to a total impossibility  sen journey p    life what is the life of man is it not to shift from

the most difficult and tortuous passages to the heart  sen jour p   0 perfection man has a certain compass as well as an instrument and the social and other calls have occasion by turns for every key in him so that if you begin a note too high or too low there must be a want either in the upper or under part to fill up the system of harmony  a polished nation makes every one its debtor and besides urbanity itself like the fair sex has so many charms it goes against the heart to say it can do ill and yet i believe there is but a certain line of perfection that man take him altogether is empowered to arrive at  if he gets beyond he rather exchanges qualities than gets them i must not presume to say how far this has affected the french  but should it ever be the case of the english in the progress of their resentments to arrive at the same polish which distinguishes the french if we did not lose the politesse de caeur which inclines men more to humane actions than courteous ones  we should at least lose that distinct variety and originality of character which distinguishes them not only from each other but from all the world besides  sen jour p     forgiveness the brave only know how to forgive  it is the most refined and generous pitch of virtue human nature can arrive at  cowards have done good and kind actions christian hero   cowards have even fought  nay sometimes even conquered but a coward never forgave  it is not in his nature  the power of doing it flows only from a strength and greatness of soul conscious of its own force and security and above the little temptations of resenting every fruitless attempt to interrupt its happiness  sermon xii p     favors in returning favors we act differently from what we do in conferring them in the one case we simply consider what is best  in the other what is most acceptable the reason is that we have a right to act according to our own ideas of what will do the party most good in the case where we bestow a favor  but where we return one we lose this right and act according to his conceptions who has obliged us and endeavor to repay in such a manner as we think it most likely to be accepted in discharge of the obligation  sermon xiii p   0 rustic felicity many are the silent pleasures of the honest peasant who rises cheerfully to his labor  look into his dwelling  where the scene of every mans happiness chiefly lies  he has the same domestic endearments  as much joy and comfort in his children  and as flattering hopes of their doing well  to enliven his hours and glad his heart as you could conceive in the most affluent station  and i make no doubt in general but if the true account of his joys and sufferings were to be balanced with those of his betters  that the upshot would prove to be little more than this  that the rich man had the more meat  but the poor man the better stomach  the one had more luxury  more able physicians to attend and set him to rights  the other more health and soundness in his bones and less occasion for their help  that after these two articles betwixt them were balanced  in all other things they stood upon a level  that the sun shines as warm  the air blows as fresh and the earth breathes as fragrant upon the one as the other and that they have an equal share in all the beauties and real benefits of nature  sermon xliv p   0 difference in men poverty exile loss of fame or friends the death of children the dearest of all pledges of a mans happiness make not equal impressions upon everytemper  you will see one man undergo with scarce the expense of a sigh  what another in the bitterness of his soul would go mourning for all his life long  nay a hasty word or an unkind look to a soft and tender nature will strike deeper than a sword to the hardened and senseless  if these reflections hold true with regard to misfortunes  they are the same with regard to enjoyments  we are formed differently  have different tastes and perceptions of things  by the force of habit education or a particular cast of mind  it happens that neither the use or possession of the same enjoyments and advantages produce the same happiness and contentment  but that it differs in every man almost according to his temper and complexion so that the selfsame happy accidents in life which shall give raptures to the choleric or sanguine man shall be received with indifference by the cold and phlegmatic  and so oddly perplexed are the accounts of both human happiness and misery in this world  that trifles light as air shall be able to make the hearts of some men sing for joy  at the same time that others with real blessings and advantages without the power of using them have their hearts heavy and discontented  alas if the principles of contentment are not within us  the height of station and worldly grandeur will as soon add a cubit to a mans stature as to his happiness  sermon xliv p     against hasty opinion there are numbers of circumstances which attend every action of a mans life which can never come to the knowledge of the world  yet ought to be known and well weighed before sentence with any justice can be passed upon him  a man may have different views and a different sense of things from what his judges have and what he understands and feels and what passes within him may be a secret treasured up deeply there for ever  a man through bodily infirmity or some complectional defect which perhaps is not in his power to correct may be subject to inadvertencies  to starts  and unhappy turns of temper he may lay open to snares he is not always aware of or through ignorance and want of information and proper helps he may labor in the dark  in all which cases he may do many things which are wrong in themselves and yet be innocent  at least an object rather to be pitied than censured with severity and ill will  these are difficulties which stand in every ones way in the forming a judgment of the characters of others

duties to speak what our opinions are  but god forbid that this ever should be done but from its best motive  the sense of what is due to virtue governed by discretion and the utmost fellowfeeling were we to go on otherwise beginning with the great broad cloak of hypocrisy and so down through all its little trimmings and facings tearing away without mercy all that looked seemly  we should leave but a tattered world of it  sermon xvii p  0 defamation does humanity clothe and aducate the unknown orphan  poverty thou have no genealogies  see is he not the father of the child thus do we rob

half of the world who are generally outraged and borne down by the other half of it but in this they have the advantage whatever be the sense of their wrongs that pride stands not so watchful a sentinel over their forgiveness as it does in the breasts of the fierce and froward we should all of us i believe be more forgiving than we are would the world but give us leave but it is apt to interpose its illoffices in remissions especially of this kind the truth is it has its laws to which the heart is not always a party and acts so like an unfeeling engine in all cases without distinction that it requires all the firmness of the most settled humanity to bear up against it  sermon xviii p    religion there are no principles but those of religion to be depended on in cases of real distress and that these are able to encounter the worst emergencies and to bear us up under all the changes and chances to which our life is subject  sermon xv p    eloquence great is the power

retirement etc yet still  it is not good for man to be alone nor can all which the coldhearted pedant stuns our ears with upon the subject ever give one answer of satisfaction to the mind in the midst of the loudest vauntings of philosophy nature will have her yearnings for society and friendship  a good heart wants some object to be kind to  and the best parts of our blood and the purest of our spirits suffer most under the destitution  let the torpid monk seek heaven comfortless and alone  god speed him for my own part i fear i should never so find the way let me be wise and religious  but let me be man wherever thy providence places me or whatever be the road i take to get to thee  give me some companion in my journey be it only to remark to how our shadows lengthen as the sun goes down  to whom i may say how fresh is the face of nature how sweet the flowers of the field how delicious are these fruits  sermon xviii p  0 dissatisfaction i pity the men whose natural pleasures are burdens and who fly from joy as these splenetic and morose souls do as if it was really an evil in itself  sermon xxii p     sorrow and heaviness of heart if there is an evil in this world it is sorrow and heaviness of heart  the loss of goods  of health  of coronets and mitres are only evil as they occasion sorrow  take that out  the rest is fancy and dwells only in the head of man  poor unfortunate creature that he is as if the causes of anguish in the heart were not enough  but he must fill up the measure with those of caprice and not only walk in a vain shadow  but disquiet himself in vain too  we are a restless set of beings and as we are likely to continue so to the end of the world  the best we can do in it is to make the same use of this part of our character which wise men do of other bad propensities  when they find they cannot conquer them  they endeavor at least to divert them into good channels  if therefore we must be a solicitous race of selftormentors  let us drop the common objects which make us so  and for gods sake be solicitous only to live well  sermon xxii p     rooted opinion not easily eradicated how difficult you will find it to convince a miserly heart that any thing is good which is not profitable or a libertine one that any thing is bad which is pleasant  sermon xxiii page     death there are many instances of men who have received the news of death with the greatest ease of mind and even entertained the thoughts of it with smiles upon their countenances  and this either from strength of spirits and the natural cheerfulness of their temper  or that they knew the world and cared not for it  or expected a better  yet thousands of good men with all the helps of philosophy and against all the assurances of a wellspent life that the change must be to their account  upon the approach of death have still leaned toward this world and wanted spirits and resolution to bear the shock of a separation from it for ever  sermon xvii page    sorrow sweet is the look of sorrow for an offense in a heart determined never to commit it more  upon that alter only could i offer up my wrongs  sermon xviii p    simplicity simplicity is the great friend to nature and if i would be proud of any thing in this silly world it should be of this honest alliance  sermon xxiv p     covetousness to know truly what it is we must know what masters it serves  they are many and of various casts and humors  and each one lends it something of its own complexional tint and character  this i suppose may be the cause that there is a greater and more whimsical mystery in the love of money than in the darkest and most nonsensical problem that ever was pored on  even at the best and when the passion seems to seek something more than its own amusement  there is little  very little i fear to be said for its humanity  it may be a sport to the miser  but consider  it must be death and destruction to others  the moment this sordid humor begins to govern  farewell all honest and natural affection farewell all he owes to parents to children to friends  how fast the obligations vanish see  he is now stripped of all feelings whatever  the shrill cry of justice  and the low lamentation of humble distress are notes equally beyond his compass  eternal god see  he passes by one whom thou have just bruised without one pensive reflection  he enters the cabin of the widow whose husband and child thou have taken to thyself  exacts his bond without a sigh  heaven if i am to be be tempted  let it be by glory  by ambition  by some generous and manly vice  if i must fall let it be by some passion which thou have planted in my nature which shall not harden my heart but leave me room at last to retreat and come back to thee  sermon xix page    humility he that is little in his own eyes is little too in his desires and consequently moderate in his pursuit of them like another man he may fail in his attempts and lose the point he aimed at  but that is all  he loses not himself  he loses not his happiness and peace of mind with it  even the contentions of the humble man are mild and placid  blessed character when such a one is thrust back who does not pity him  when he falls who would not stretch out a hand to raise him up  sermon xxv p     patience and contentment patience and contentment  which like the treasure hid in the field for which a man sold all he had to purchase  is of that price that it cannot be had at too great a purchase since without it the best condition in life cannot make us happy  and with it it is impossible we should be miserable even in the worst  sermon xv p    humility contrasted with pride when we reflect upon the character of humility  we are apt to think it stands the most naked and defenseless of all virtues whatever  the least able to support its claims against the insolent antagonist who seems ready to bear him down and all opposition which such a temper can make  now if we consider him as standing alone  no doubt in such a case he will be overpowered and trampled upon by his opposer  but if we consider the meek and lowly man as he is  fenced and guarded by the love the friendship and wishes of all mankind  that the other stands alone hated discountenanced without one true friend or hearty wellwisher on his side  when this is balanced we shall have reason to change our opinion and be convinced that the humble man strengthened with such an alliance is far from being so overmatched as at first sight he may appear  nay i believe one might venture to go further and engage for it that in all such cases where real fortitude and true personal courage were wanted he is much more likely to give proof of it and i would sooner look for it in such a temper than in that of his adversary pride may make a man violent  but humility will make him firm  and which of the two do you think likely to come off with honor  he who acts from the changeable impulse of heated blood and follows the uncertain motions of his pride and fury  or the man who stands cool and collected in himself who governs his resentiments instead of being governed by them and on every occasion acts upon the steady motives of principle and duty  sermon xxv p     with regard to the provocations and offenses which are unavoidably happening to a man in his commerce with the world  take it as a rule  as a mans pride is  so is always his displeasure as the opinion of himself rises  so does the injury  so does his resentment it is this which gives edge and force to the instrument which has struck him  and excites that heat in the wound which renders it incurable  see how different the case is with the humble man one half of these painful conflicts he actually escapes the other part fall lightly on him  he provokes no man by contempt thrusts himself forward as the mark of no mans envy so that he cuts off the first fretful occasions of the greatest part of these evils and for those in which the passions of others would involve him like the humble shrub in the valley gently gives way and scarce feels the injury of those stormy encounters which rend the proud cedar and tear it up by its roots  sermon xxv p   0 pride the proud man  see  he is sore all over touch him  you put him to pain and though of all others he acts as if every mortal was void of all sense and feeling yet is possessed with so nice and exquisite a one himself that the slights the little neglects and instances of disesteem which would be scarce felt by another man are perpetually wounding him and ofttimes piercing him to his very heart  sermon xxiv p     pride is a vice which grows up in society so insensibly  steals in unobserved upon the heart upon so many occasions  forms itself upon such strange pretensions and when it has done veils itself under such a variety of unsuspected appearances  sometimes even under that of humility itself  in all which cases selflove like a false friend instead of checking most treacherously feeds this humor  points out some excellence in every soul to make him vain and think more highly of himself than he ought to think  that upon the whole there is no one weakness into which the heart of man is more easily betrayed  or which requires greater helps of good sense and good principles to guard against  sermon xxiv p     beauty beauty has so many charms one knows not how to speak against it and when it happens that a graceful figure is the habitation of a virtuous soul when the beauty of the face speaks out the modesty and humility of the mind and the justness of the proportion raises our thoughts up to the art and wisdom of the great creator something may be allowed it  and something to the embellishments which set it off  and yet when the whole apology is read  it will be found at last that beauty like truth never is so glorious as when it goes the plainest  sermon xxiv p     wisdom lessons of wisdom have never such power over us as when they are wrought into the heart through the ground  work of a story which engages the passions is it that we are like iron and must first be heated before we can wrought upon or is the heart so in love with deceit that where a true report will not reach it we must cheat it with a fable in order to come at truth  sermon xx p    hunger of all the terrors of nature that of one day or other dying by hunger is the greatest and it is wisely wove into our frame to awaken man to industry and call forth his talents and though we seem to go on carelessly sporting with it as we do with other terrors  yet he that sees this enemy fairly and in his most frightful shape will need no long remonstrance to make him turn out of the way to avoid him  sermon xx p    distress nothing so powerfully calls home the mind as distress the tense fiber then relaxes  the soul retires to itself  sits pensive and susceptible of right impressions if we have a friend it is then we think of him if a benefactor at that moment all his kindnesses press upon our mind  sermon xx p    imposture imposture is all dissonance let what master soever of it undertake the part let him harmonise and modulate it as he may one tone will contradict another and whilst we have ears to hear we shall distinguish it it is truth only which is consistent and ever in harmony with itself it sits upon our lips like the natural notes of some melodies ready to drop out whether we will or no  it racks no invention to let ourselves alone and needs fear no critic to have the same excellency in the heart which appears in the action  sermon xvii p    contentment there is scarce any lot so low but there is something in it to satisfy the man whom it has befallen providence having so ordered things that in every mans cup how bitter soever there are some cordial drops  some good circumstances which if wisely extracted are sufficient for the purpose he wants them  that is to make him contented and if not happy at least resigned  sermon xv p    evils unwillingly does the mind digest the evils prepared for it by others  for those we prepare ourselves  we eat but the fruit which we have planted and watered  a shattered fortune  a shattered frame so we have but the satisfaction of shattering them ourselves pass naturally enough into the habit and by the ease with which they are both done they save the spectator a world of pity but for those like jacobs brought upon him by the hands from which he looked for all his comforts  the avarice of a parent  the unkindness of a relation  the ingratitude of a child  they are evils which leave a scar  besides as they hang over the heads of all and therefore may fall upon any  every lookeron has an interest in the tragedy  but then we are apt to interest ourselves no otherwise than merely as the incidents themselves strike our passions without carrying the lesson further  in a word  we realize nothing  we sigh  we wipe away the tear  and there ends the story of misery and the moral with it  sermon xxii p     oppression solomon says oppression will make a wise man mad  what will it do then to a tender and ingenuous heart which feels itself neglected  too full of reverence for the author of its wrongs to complain  see it sits down in silence robbed by discouragements of all its natural powers to please  born to see others loaded with caresses  in some uncheery corner it nourishes its discontent  and with a weight upon its spirits which its little stock of fortitude is not able to withstand  it droops and pines away  sad victim of caprice  sermon xxii p     virtue and vice whoever considers the state and condition of human nature and upon this view how much stronger the natural motives are to virtue than to vice would expect to find the world much better than it is or ever has been  for who would suppose the generality of mankind to betray so much folly as to act against the common interest of their own kind as every man does who yields to the temptation of what is wrong  sermon xxxiii p    sin no motives have been great enough to restrain those from sin who have secretly loved it and only sought pretenses for the practice of it  sermon xxxiii p    sincerity an inward sincerity will of course influence the outward deportment but where the one is wanting there is great reason to suspect the absence of the other  sermon xliii p     wisdom there is no one project to which the whole race of mankind is so universally a bubble as to that of being thought wise and the affectation of it is so visible in men of all complexions that you every day see some one or other so very solicitous to establish the character as not to allow himself leisure to do the things which fairly win it  expending more art and stratagem to appear so in the eyes of the world than what would suffice to make him so in truth  it is owing to the force of this desire that you see in general there is no injury touches a man so sensibly as an insult upon his parts and capacity tell a man of other defects that he wants learning industry or application  he will hear your reproof with patience  nay you may go further take him in a proper season you may tax his morals  you may tell him he is irregular in his conduct  passionate or revengeful in his nature  loose in his principles  deliver it with the gentleness of a friend  possibly he will not only bear with you  but if ingenuous he will thank you for your lecture and promise a reformation  but hint  hint but at a defect in his intellectuals  touch but that sore place  from that moment you are looked upon as an enemy sent to torment him before his time and in return may reckon upon his resentment and ill will for ever so that in general you will find it safer to tell a man he is a knave than a fool  and stand a better chance of being forgiven for proving he has been wanting in a point of common honesty than a point of common sense  strange souls that we are as if to live well was not the greatest argument of wisdom  and as if what reflected upon our morals did not most of all reflect upon our understandings  sermon xxvi p  0  corporal trims reflections on death my young master in london is dead said obadiah    a green satin nightgown of my mothers which had been twice scoured was the first idea which obadiahs exclamation brought into susannahs head  then quoth susannah we must all go into mourning    o twill be the death of my poor mistress cried susannah  my mothers whole wardrobe followed  what a procession her red damask  her orangetawny  her white and yellowlutestrings  her brown taffata  her bonelaced caps her bedgowns  and comfortable underpetticoats  not a rag was left behind   no  she will never look up again said susannah  we had a fat foolish scullion  my father i think kept her for her simplicity  she had been all autumn struggling with a dropsy  he is dead  said obadiah  he is certainly dead  so am not i said the foolish scullion   here is sad news trim cried susannah wiping her eyes as trim stepped into the kitchen  master bobby is dead and buried  the funeral was an interpolation of susannahs we shall have all to go into mourning said susannah  i hope not said trim  you hope not cried susannah earnestly  the mourning ran not in trims head whatever it did in susannahs  i hope  said trim explaining himself i hope in god the news is not true i heard the letter read with my own ears answered obadiah oh he is dead said susannah  as sure said the scullion as i am alive  i lament for him from my heart and my soul said trim fetching a sigh  poor creature  poor boy poor gentleman   he was alive last whitsuntide said the coachman  whitsuntide alas cried trim extending his right arm and falling instantly into the same attitude in which he read the sermon  what is whitsuntide jonathan for that was the coachmans name or shrovetide or any tide or time past to this are we not here now continued the corporal striking the end of his stick perpendicularly upon the floor so as to give an idea of health and stability  and are we not  dropping his hat upon the ground gone in a moment  twas infinitely striking susannah burst into a flood of tears  we are not stocks and stones  jonathan obadiah the cookmaid all melted  the foolish fat scullion herself who was scouring a fishkettle upon her knees was roused with it  the whole kitchen crowded about the corporal   to us jonathan who know not what want or care is  who live here in the service of two of the best of masters  bating in my own case his majesty king william the third whom i had the honor to serve both in ireland and flanders  i own it that from whitsuntide to within three weeks of christmas  it is not long  it is like nothing  but to those jonathan who know what death is and what havoc and destruction he can make before a man can well wheel about  it is like a whole age  o jonathan twould make a goodnatured mans heart bleed to consider continued the corporal standing perpendicularly how low many a brave and upright fellow has been laid since that time  and trust me susy added the corporal turning to susannah whose eyes were swimming in water  before that time comes round again  many a bright eye will be dim  susannah placed it to the right side of the page  she wept  but she curtsied too  are we not continued trim looking still at susannah  are we not like a flower of the field  a tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of humiliation  else no tongue could have described susannahs affliction  is not all flesh grass  it is clay  it is dirt  they all looked directly at the scullion  the scullion had just been scouring a fishkettle  it was not fair    what is the finest face that ever man looked at  i could hear trim talk so for ever cried susannah  what is it  susannah laid her hand upon trims shoulder  but corruption  susannah took it off   now i love you for this  and it is this delicious mixture within you which makes you dear creatures what you are  and he who hates you for it  all i can say of the matter is  that he has either a pumpkin for his head  or a pippen for his heart  and whenever he is dissected twill be found so  for my own part i declare it that out of doors i value not death at all  not this added the corporal snapping his fingers  but with an air which no one but the corporal could have given to the sentiment  in battle i value death not this and let him not take me cowardly like poor joe gibbins in scouring his gun  what is he a pull of a trigger  a push of a bayonet an inch this way or that  makes the difference  look along the line  to the right  see jacks down well  it is worth a regiment of horse to him  no  it is dick then jacks no worse never mind which  we pass on  in hot pursuit the wound itself which brings him is not felt  the best way is to stand up to him  the man who flies is in ten times more danger than the man who marches up into his jaws  i have looked him added the corporal an hundred times in the face  and know what he is  he is nothing obadiah at all in the field  but he is very frightful in a house quoth obadiah  i never mind it myself said jonathan upon a coachbox  i pity my mistress  she will never get the better of it cried susannah  now i pity the captain the most of any one in the family answered trim  madam will get ease of heart in weeping  and the squire in talking about it  but my poor master will keep it all in silence to himself  i shall hear him sigh in his bed for a whole month together as he did for lieutenant le fever an please your honor do not sigh so piteously i would say to him as i laid beside him i cannot help it trim my master would say  it is so melancholy an accident  i cannot get it off my heart  your honor fears not death yourself  i hope trim i fear nothing he would say but the doing a wrong thing  well he would add whatever betides i will take care of le fevers boy  and with that like a quieting draught his honor would sall asleep  i like to hear trims stories about the captain said susannah  he is a kindlyhearted gentleman said obadiah as ever lived  aye  and as brave a one too said the corporal as ever stepped before a platoon there never was a better officer in the kings army  or a better man in gods world for he would march up to the mouth of a cannon though he saw the lighted match at the very touchhole  and yet for all that he has a heart as soft as a child for other people  he would not hurt a chicken  i would sooner quoth jonathan drive such a gentleman for seven pounds a year  than some for eight  thank thee jonathan for thy twenty shillings  as much jonathan said the corporal shaking him by the hand as if thou had put the money into my own pocket  i would serve him to the day of my death out of love he is a friend and a brother to me  and could i be sure my poor brother tom was dead  continued the corporal taking out his handkerchief  was i worth ten thousand pounds i would leave every shilling of it to the captain  trim could not refrain from tears at this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his master  the whole kitchen was affected  tris shandy vol iii c   mr shandys resignation for the loss of his son philosophy has a fine saying for every thing  for death it has an entire set  it is an inevitable chance  the first statute in magna charta  it is an everlasting act of parliament  all must die  monarchs and princes dance in the same ring with us    to die is the great debt and tribute due unto nature tombs and monuments which should perpetuate our memories pay it themselves and the proudest pyramid of them all which wealth and science have erected has lost its apex and stands obtruncated in the travellers horizon  kingdoms and provinces and towns and cities have they not their periods and when those principles and powers which at first cemented and put them together have performed their several revolutions they fall back    where is troy and mycenae and thebes and delos and persepolis and agrigentum  what is become of nineveh and babylon of cyzicum and mitylenae the fairest towns that ever the sun rose upon are now no more the names only are left and those for many of them are wrong spelt are falling themselves by piecemeals to decay and in length of time will be forgotten and involved with every thing in a perpetual night the world itself  must must come to an end  returning out of asia when i sailed from aegina toward megara i began to view the country round about aegina was behind me megara was before pyraeus on the right hand corinth on the left  what flourishing towns now prostrate upon the earth alas alas said i to myself that man should disturb his soul for the loss of a child when so much as this lies awfully buried in his presence  remember said i to myself again  remember thou art a man    my son is dead  so much the better  it is a shame in such a tempest to have but one anchor  but he is gone for ever from us  be it so he is got from under the hands of his barber before he was bald  he is but risen from a feast before he was surfeited  from a banquet before he had got drunken  the thracians wept when a child was born  and feasted and made merry when a man went out of the world and with reason death opens the gate of fame and shuts the gate of envy after it  it unlooses the chain of the captive and puts the bondsmans task into another mans hands  show me the man who knows what life is who dreads it and i will show thee a prisoner who dreads his liberty  the end printed
