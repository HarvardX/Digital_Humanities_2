the skies for future ages shall relate the grecians fame and trojans fate nor ever shall hoary time destroy the page that tells the siege of troy remarks perhaps no subject ever afforded a greater scope for the painters pencil or the ingenuity of the machinist in point of stageeffect than the famous siege of troy nor has the composer had a less field for his musical abilities it will be seen that the performers in general have each their share of business in this splendid and heroic spectacle and are not wanting in pantomimic action to convey a proper idea of the nature of the siege as well as the credulity of the besieged in admitting within their walls the grand trojan war horse which contained five hundred grecian soldiers properly equipped for battle etc within its body  the pantomime will be given every evening till further notice
