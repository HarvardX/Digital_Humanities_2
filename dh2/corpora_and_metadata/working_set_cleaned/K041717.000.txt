the prophecy of famine a scots pastoral by c churchill inscribed to john wilkes esquire  carmina tum melius cum venerit ipse canemus  dr king oxon london printed for the author and sold by g kearsly in ludgate street mdcclxiii  the prophecy of famine a scots pastoral when cupid first instructs his darts to fly from the sly corner of some cookmaids eye the stripling raw just entered in his teens receives the wound and wonders what it means his heart like dripping melts and new desire within him stirs each time she stirs the fire trembling and blushing he the fair one views and fain would speak but cannot  without a muse so to the sacred mount he takes his way prunes his young wings and tunes his infant lay his oaten reed to rural ditties frames to flocks and rocks to hills and rills proclaims in simplest notes and all unpolished strains the loves of nymphs and eke the loves of swains clad as your nymphs were always clad of yore in rustic weeds  a cookmaid now no more  beneath an aged oak lardella lies  green moss her couch her canopy the skies from aromatic shrubs the roguish gale steals young perfumes and wafts them through the vale the youth turned swain and skilled in rustic lays fast by her side his amorous descant plays herds low flocks bleat pies chatter ravens scream and the full chorus dies adown the stream the streams with music freighted as they pass present the fair lardella with a glass and zephyr to complete the lovesick plan waves his light wings and serves her for a fan but when maturer judgment takes the lead these childish toys on reasons altar bleed formed after some great man whose name breeds awe whose every sentence fashion makes a law who on mere credit his vain trophies rears and founds his merit on our servile fears then we discard the workings of the heart and natures banished by mechanic art then deeply read our reading must be shown vain is that knowledge which remains unknown then ostentation marches to our aid and lettered pride stalks forth in full parade beneath their care behold the work refine pointed each sentence polished every line trifles are dignified and taught to wear the robes of ancients with a modern air nonsense with classic ornaments is graced and passes current with the stamp of taste then the rude theocrite is ransacked over and courtly maro called from mincios shore sicilian muses on our mountains roam easy and free as if they were at home nymphs naiads nereids dryads satyrs fauns sport in our floods and trip it over our lawns flowers which once flourished fair in greece and rome more fair revive in englands meads to bloom skies without cloud exotic suns adorn and roses blush but blush without a thorn landscapes unknown to dowdy nature rise and new creations strike our wondering eyes for bards like these who neither sing nor say grave without thought and without feeling gay whose numbers in one even tenor flow attund to pleasure and attund to woe who if plain commonsense her visit pays and mars one couplet in their happy lays as at some ghost affrighted start and stare and ask the meaning of her coming there for bards like these a wreath shall mason bring lined with the softest down from follys wing in loves pagoda shall they ever doze and gisbel kindly rock them to repose my lord  to letters as to faith most true  at once their patron and example too  shall quaintly fashion his lovelabourd dreams sigh with sad winds and weep with weeping streams curious in grief for real grief we know is curious to dress up the tale of woe from the green umbrage of some druids seat shall his own works in his own way repeat me whom no muse of heavenly birth inspires no judgment tempers when rash genius fires who boast no merit but mere knack of rhyme short gleams of sense and satire out of time who cannot follow where trim fancy leads by prattling streams over flowrempurpled meads who often but without success have prayed for apt alliterations artful aid who would but cannot with a masters skill coin fine new epithets which mean no ill me thus uncouth thus every way unfit for pacing poesy and ambling wit taste with contempt beholds nor deigns to place amongst the lowest of her favored race thou nature art my goddess  to thy law myself i dedicate  hence slavish awe which bends to fashion and obeys the rules imposed at first and since observed by fools hence those vile tricks which mar fair natures hue and bring the sober matron forth to view with all that artificial tawdry glare which virtue scorns and none but strumpets wear sick of those pomps those vanities that waste of toil which critics now mistake for taste of false refinements sick and labored ease which art too thinly veiled forbids to please by natures charms inglorious truth subdued however plain her dress and haviour rude to northern climes my happier course i steer climes where the goddess reigns throughout the year where undisturbed by arts rebellious plan she rules the loyal lord and faithful clan to that rare soil where virtues clustring grow what mighty blessings does not england owe what waggonloads of courage wit and sense does each revolving day import from thence to us she gives disinterested friend faith without fraud and stuarts without end when we prosperitys rich trappings wear come not her generous sons and take a share and if by some disastrous turn of fate change should ensue and ruin sieze our state shall we not find safe in that hallowed ground such refuge as the holy martyr found nor less our debt in science though denied by the weak slaves of prejudice and pride thence came the ramsays names of worthy note of whom one paints as well as the other wrote thence home disbanded from the sons of prayer for loving plays though no dull dean was there thence issued forth at great macphersons call that old new epic pastoral fingal thence simple bards by simple prudence taught to this wise town by simple patrons brought in simple manner utter simple lays and take with simple pensions simple praise waft me some muse to twedes inspiring stream where all the little loves and graces dream where slowly winding the dull waters creep and seem themselves to own the power of sleep where on the surface lead like feathers swims there let me bathe my yet unhallowed limbs as once a syrian bathed in jordans flood wash off my native stains correct that blood which mutinies at call of english pride and deaf to prudence rolls a patriot tide from solemn thought which overhangs the brow of patriot care when things are  god knows how from nice trim points where honor slave to rule in compliment to folly plays the fool from those gay scenes where mirth exalts his power and easy humor wings the laughing hour from those soft better moments when desire beats high and all the world of mans on fire when mutual ardours of the melting fair more than repay us for whole years of care at friendships summons will my wilkes retreat and see once seen before that ancient seat that ancient seat where majesty displayed her ensigns long before the world was made mean narrow maxims which enslave mankind never from its bias warp thy settled mind not dupd by party nor opinions slave those faculties which bounteous nature gave thy honest spirit into practice brings nor courts the smile nor dreads the frown of kings let rude licentious englishmen comply with tumults voice and curse they know not why unwilling to condemn thy soul disdains to wear vile factions arbitrary chains and strictly weighs in apprehension clear things as they are and not as they appear with thee good humor tempers lively wit enthroned with judgment candor loves to sit and nature gave thee open to distress a heart to pity and a hand to bless often have i heard thee mourn the wretched lot of the poor mean despised insulted scot who might calm reason credit idle tales by rancour forged where prejudice prevails or starves at home or practices through fear of starving arts which damn all conscience here when scriblers to the charge by interest led the fierce northbriton foaming at their head pour forth invectives deaf to candours call and injured by one alien rail at all on northern pisgah when they take their stand to mark the weakness of that holy land with needless truths their libels to adorn and hang a nation up to public scorn thy generous soul condemns the frantic rage and hates the faithful but illnatured page the scots are poor cries surly english pride true is the charge nor by themselves denied are they not then in strictest reason clear who wisely come to mend their fortunes here if by low supple arts successful grown they sappd our vigor to increase their own if mean in want and insolent in power they only fawned more surely to devour roused by such wrongs should reason take alarm and even the muse for public safety arm but if they own ingenuous virtues sway and follow where true honor points the way if they revere the hand by which they are fed and bless the donors for their daily bread or by vast debts of higher import bound are always humble always grateful found if they directed by pauls holy pen become discreetly all things to all men that all men may become all things to them envy may hate but justice cannot condemn into our places states and beds they creep they have sense to get what we want sense to keep once be the hour accursed accursed the place i ventured to blaspheme the chosen race into those traps which men called patriots laid by specious arts unwarily betrayed madly i leagued against that sacred earth vile parricide which gave a parent birth but shall i meanly errors path pursue when heavenly truth presents her friendly clue once plunged in ill shall i go farther in to make the oath was rash to keep it sin backward i tread the paths i trod before and calm reflection hates what passion swore converted blessed are the souls which know those pleasures which from true conversion flow whether to reason who now rules my breast or to pure faith like lyttleton and west past crimes to expiate be my present aim to raise new trophies to the scottish name to make what can the proudest muse do more even factions sons her brighter worth adore to make her glories stamped with honest rhimes in fullest tide roll down to latest times presumptuous wretch and shall a muse like thine an english muse the meanest of the nine attempt a theme like this can her weak strain expect indulgence from the mighty thane should he from toils of government retire and for a moment fan the poets fire should he of sciences the moral friend each curious each important search suspend leave unassisted hill of herbs to tell and all the wonders of a cockleshell having the lords good grace before his eyes would not the home step forth and gain the prize or if this wreath of honor might adorn the humble brows of one in england born presumptuous still thy daring must appear vain all thy towering hopes whilst i am here thus spoke a form by silken smile and tone dull and unvaried for the laureat known follys chief friend decorums eldest son in every party found and yet of none this airy substance this substantial shade abashed i heard and with respect obeyed from themes too lofty for a bard so mean discretion beckons to an humbler scene the restless fever of ambition laid calm i retire and seek the sylvan shade now be the muse disrobed of all her pride be all the glare of verse by truth supplied and if plain nature pours a simple strain which bute may praise and ossian not disdain ossian sublimest simplest bard of all whom english infidels macpherson call then round my head shall honors ensigns wave and pensions mark me for a willing slave two boys whose birth beyond all question springs from great and glorious though forgotten kings shepherds of scottish lineage born and bred on the same bleak and barren mountains head by niggard nature doomed on the same rocks to spin out life and starve themselves and flocks fresh as the morning which enrobd in mist the mountain top with usual dullness kissed jockey and sawney to their labors rose soon clad i ween where nature needs no clothes where from their youth enured to winter skies dress and her vain refinements they despise jockey whose manly highbond cheeks to crown with freckles spotted flamed the golden down with mickle art could on the bagpipes play even from the rising to the setting day sawney as long without remorse could bawl homes madrigals and ditties from fingal often at his strains all natural though rude the highland lass forgot her want of food and whilst she scratched her lover into rest sunk pleased though hungry on her sawneys breast far as the eye could reach no tree was seen earth clad in russet scorned the lively green the plague of locusts they secure defy for in three hours a grasshopper must die no living thing whatever its food feasts there but the camaelion who can feast on air no birds except as birds of passage flew no be was known to hum no dove to coo no streams as amber smooth as amber clear were seen to glide or heard to warble here rebellions spring which through the country ran furnished with bitter draughts the steady clan no flowers embalmed the air but one white rose which on the tenth of june by instinct blows by instinct blows at morn and when the shades of drizly eve prevail by instinct fades one and but one poor solitary cave too sparing of her favors nature gave that one alone hard tax on scottish pride shelter at once for man and beast supplied their snares without entangling briers spread and thistles armed against the invaders head stood in close ranks all entrance to oppose thistles now held more precious than the rose all creatures which on natures earliest plan were formed to loath and to be loathed by man which owed their birth to nastiness and spite deadly to touch and hateful to the sight creatures which when admitted in the ark their savior shunned and rankled in the dark found place within marking her noisome road with poisons trail here crawled the bloated toad there webs were spread of more than common size and halfstarvd spiders preyed on halfstarvd flies in quest of food efts strove in vain to crawl slugs pinched with hunger smeared the slimy wall the cave around with hissing serpents rung on the damp roof unhealthy vapor hung and famine by her children always known as proud as poor here fixed her native throne here for the sullen sky was overcast and summer shrunk beneath a wintry blast a native blast which armed with hail and rain beat unrelenting on the naked swain the boys for shelter made behind the sheep of which those shepherds every day take keep sickly crept on and with complainings rude on nature seemed to call and bleat for food jockey since to this cave by tempest we are confined and within ken our flocks under the wind safe from the pelting of this perilous storm are laid among yon thistles dry and warm what sawney if by shepherds arts we try to mock the rigor of this cruel sky what if we tune some merry roundelay well do thou sing nor ill does jockey play sawney ah jockey ill advisest thou i wis to think of songs at such a time as this sooner shall herbage crown these barren rocks sooner shall fleeces cloth these ragged flocks sooner shall want sieze shepherds of the south and we forget to live from hand to mouth than sawney out of season shall impart the songs of gladness with an aching heart jockey still have i known thee for a silly swain of things past help what boots it to complain nothing but mirth can conquer fortunes spite no sky is heavy if the heart be light patience is sorrows salve what cannot be cured so donald right areeds must be endured sawney full silly swain i wot is jockey now how did thou bear thy maggys falsehood how when with a foreign loon she stole away did thou forswear thy pipe and shepherds lay where was thy boasted wisdom then when i applied those proverbs which you now apply jockey o she was bonny all the highlands round was there a rival to my maggy found more precious though that precious is to all than the rare medicine which we brimstone call or that choice plant so grateful to the nose which in i know not what far country grows was maggy unto me dear do i rue a lass so fair should ever prove untrue sawney whether with pipe or song to charm the ear through all the land did jamie find a peer cursed be that year by every honest scot and in the shepherds calendar forgot that fatal year when jamie hapless swain in evil hour forsook the peaceful plain jamie when our young lord discreetly fled was seized and hanged till he was dead dead dead jockey full sorely may we all lament that day for all were losers in the deadly fray five brothers had i on the scottish plains well do thou know were none more hopeful swains five brothers there i lost in manhoods pride two in the field and three on gibbets died ah silly swains to follow wars alarms ah what has shepherds life to do with arms sawney mention it not  there saw i strangers clad in all the honors of our ravished played saw the ferrara too our nations pride unwilling grace the awkward victors side there fell our choicest youth and from that day mote never sawney tune the merry lay blessed those which fell cursed those which still survive to mourn fifteen renewed in fortyfive thus plained the boys when from her throne of turf with boils embossed and overgrown with scurf vile humors which in lifes corrupted well mixed at the birth not abstinence could quell pale famine reared the head her eager eyes where hunger even to madness seemed to rise speaking aloud her throes and pangs of heart strained to get loose and from their orbs to start her hollow cheeks were each a deepsunk cell where wretchedness and horror loved to dwell with double rows of useless teeth supplied her mouth from ear to ear extended wide which when for want of food her entrails pined she opened and cursing swallowed naught but wind all shrivelled was her skin and here and there making their way by force her bones lay bare such filthy sight to hide from human view over her foul limbs a tattered played she threw cease cried the goddess cease despairing swains and from a parent hear what jove ordains pent in this barren corner of the isle where partial fortune never deigned to smile like natures bastards reaping for our share what was rejected by the lawful heir unknown amongst the nations of the earth or only known to raise contempt and mirth long free because the race of roman braves thought it not worth their while to make us slaves then into bondage by that nation brought whose ruin we for ages vainly sought whom still with unslackd hate we view and still the power of mischief lost retain the will considered as the refuse of mankind a mass till the last moment left behind which frugal nature doubted as it lay whether to stamp with life or throw away which formed in haste was planted in this nook but never entered in creations book branded as traitors who for love of gold would sell their god as once their king they sold long have we born this mighty weight of ill these vile injurious taunts and bear them still but times of happier note are now at hand and the full promise of a better land there like the sons of israel having trod for the fixed term of years ordained by god a barren desert we shall sieze rich plains where milk with honey flows and plenty reigns with some few natives joined some pliant few who worship interest and our track pursue there shall we though the wretched people grieve ravage at large nor ask the owners leave for us the earth shall bring forth her increase for us the flocks shall wear a golden fleece fat beeves shall yield us dainties not our own and the grape bleed a nectar yet unknown for our advantage shall their harvests grow and scotsmen reap what they disdained to sow for us the sun shall climb the eastern hill for us the rain shall fall the dew distill when to our wishes nature cannot rise art shall be taskd to grant us fresh supplies his brawny arm shall drudging labor strain and for our pleasure suffer daily pain trade shall for us exert her utmost powers here is all the toil and all the profit ours for us the oak shall from his native steep descend and fearless travel through the deep the sail of commerce for our use unfurled shall waft the treasures of each distant world for us sublimer heights shall science reach for us their statesmen plot their churchmen preach their noblest limbs of counsel well disjoint and mocking new ones of our own appoint devouring war imprisoned in the north shall at our call in horrid pomp break forth and when his chariot wheels with thunder hung fell discord braying with her brazen tongue death in the van with anger hate and fear and desolation stalking in the rear revenge by justice guided in his train he drives impetuous over the trembling plain shall at our bidding quit his lawful prey and to meek gentle generous peace give way think not my sons that this so blessed estate stands at a distance on the roll of fate already big with hopes of future sway even from this cave i scent my destined prey think not that this dominion over a race whose former deeds shall times last annals grace in the rough face of peril must be sought and with the lives of thousands dearly bought no  fooled by cunning by that happy art which laughs to scorn the blundring heros heart into the snare shall our kind neighbors fall with open eyes and fondly give us all when rome to prop her sinking empire bore their choicest levies to a foreign shore what if we seized like a destroying flood their widowed plains and filled the realm with blood gave an unbounded loose to manly rage and scorning mercy spared nor sex nor age when for our interest too mighty grown monarchs of warlike bent possessed the throne what if we strove divisions to foment and spread the flames of civil discontent assisted those who against their king made head and gave the traitors refuge when they fled when restless glory bad her sons advance and pitched her standard in the fields of france what if disdaining oaths an empty sound by which our nation never shall be bound bravely we taught unmuzzled war to roam through the weak land and brought cheap laurels home when the bold traitors league for the defense of law religion liberty and sense when they against their lawful monarch rose and dared the lords anointed to oppose what if we still revered the banished race and strove the royal vagrants to replace with fierce rebellions shook the unsettled state and greatly dared though crossed by partial fate these facts which might where wisdom held the sway awake the very stones to bar our way there shall be nothing nor one trace remain in the dull region of an english brain blessed with that faith which mountains can remove first they shall dupes next saints last martyrs prove already is this game of fate begun under the sanction of my darling son that son whose nature royal as his name is destined to redeem our race from shame his boundless power beyond example great shall make the rough way smooth the crooked straight shall for our ease the raging floods restrain and sink the mountain level to the plain discord whom in a cavern under ground with massy fetters our late patriot bound where her own flesh the furious hag might tear and vent her curses to the vacant air where that she never might be heard of more he plantedloyalty to guard the door for better purpose shall our chief release disguise her for a time and call her peace lured by that name fine engine of deceit shall the weak english help themselves to cheat to win our love with honors shall they grace the old adherents of the stuart race for pointed out no matter by what name tories or jacobites are still the same to sooth our rage the temporising brood shall break the ties of truth and gratitude against their savior venomed falsehoods frame and brand with calumny their williams name to win our grace rare argument of wit to our untainted faith shall they commit our says which in extremest perils tried disdained and still disdains to change her side that sacred majesty they all approve who most enjoys and best deserves their love finis
