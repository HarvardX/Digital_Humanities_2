the curiosities of common water or the advantages thereof in preventing and curing many distempers  gathered from the writings of several eminent physicians and also from more than forty years experience  by john smith c m  to which are added some rules for preserving health by diet  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane a dodd without temple bar and j fox in westminster hall mdccxxiii  price one shilling  the curiosities of common water for the benefit of mankind in general i have taken pains to give the world an account of what i have found written in the works of the most eminent physicians concerning the good that mankind may receive from the use of common water and of the informations i have had concerning the benefits thereof from others by word of mouth and of what i have discovered by my own experience from frequent trials during a time that has intervened from that of thirty to seventy four years of age which is sufficient to confirm the stupendous effects thereof in many particulars that shall be mentioned as my own discovery with respect to this excellent remedy which will perform cures with very little trouble and without any charge and is also to be had wherever there are any habitations which is what can hardly be said of any other thing so that in some sense water may truly be styled an universal remedy since the diseases it either prevents or cures may have this remedy applied to all persons and in all places where men do inhabit  the first commendation of common water that i shall mention is that which is written concerning it by dr manwaring in his method and means of enjoying health wherein he says that water is a wholesome drink or rather the most wholesome  being appointed for man in his best state which does strongly argue that drink to be the most suitable for human nature  answering all the intentions of common drinks for it cools moistens and quenches thirst it is clear thin and fit to convey the nourishment through the smallest vessels of the body  and is a drink that is a rule to itself and requires little caution in the use of it since none will be tempted to drink of it more than needs and that in the primitive ages of the world waterdrinkers he says were the longest livers by some hundreds of years  nor so often sick and complaining as we are  dr keill when he treats concerning the stomach in his abridgment of the anatomy of human bodies says that water seems the fittest to promote digestion of the food which we eat all spirituous liquors having a property by which they hurt rather than help digestion the sad effects of which they are sensible of he says who by a long use thereof have lost their appetite hardly ever to be restored without drinking water which seldom fails of procuring a good appetite and a strong digestion  dr prat in his treatise of mineral water shows it to be his judgment that if people would accustom themselves to drink water they would be more free from many diseases such as tremblings palsies apoplexies giddiness pains in the head gout stone dropsy rheumatism piles and such like which diseases are most common among them that drink strong drinks and which water generally would prevent moreover he also says that water plentifully drank strengthens the stomach causes an appetite preserves the sight makes the senses lively and cleanses all the passages of the body especially those of the kidneys and bladder  it is said also by dr duncan in his treatise of hot liquors that when men contented themselves with water they had more health and strength and that at this day those who drink nothing but water are more healthy and live longer than those who drink strong liquors which raises the heat of the stomach to excess whereas water keeps it in a due temper and he adds in another part of the book that by hot liquors the blood is inflamed and such whose blood is inflamed live not so long as those who are of a cooler temper a hot blood being commonly the cause of fluxes rheums ill digestion pains in the limbs headache dimness of sight and especially of hysteric vapors he also imputes the cause of ulcers to a hot blood and declares that if men kept their blood cool and sweet by a moderate cooling diet they would never be troubled with ulcers or other breakings out  sir john floyer also in the preface to his treatise of cold baths does affirm that vapors both in men and women are caused by hot things and that by leaving off strong liquors and a hot diet and by drinking water he had procured to himself a better health and more hardiness than he had enjoyed for many years and in the body of that book he affirms that drinking of water in the morning cools the blood prevents defluxions and washes off the bilious and salt recrements by urine and that drinking water after dinner cools and stops the too high fermentation of the stomach which is the cause of breeding wind or belching after meat to the truth of which the author of this account can bear a full testimony who being for many years afflicted with this belching up of wind after meat did at length prevent the same by drinking water after eating instead of other drink which in time did cool that hypochondriack heat from whence those belchings did proceed  having read over an old book written by one sir tho eliot entitled the castle of health he there declared from his own experience that in the county of cornwall tho it was a very cold quarter the poorer sort which in his time did never or but very seldom drink any other drinks but water were strong of body and lived to a very great age to which relation that of sir henry blount is very agreeable who affirmed in his book of travels into the levant where under the turkish government the use of wine was forbid and where the common drink is water that he then had a better stomach to his food and digested it more kindly than he ever did before or since  and in the treatise of the vanity of philosophy written by dr gideon harvey it is affirmed by him that it is not heat that causes a good digestion but a proper ferment or liquor provided by nature to dissolve the food into a substance like unto pap made with fine flower which dissolvent he says is much depraved by hot spirituous liquors and therefore he commends water above all other drinks to promote digestion  waterdrinking is also said by dr allen to be good to prevent two deplorable distempers the gout and the hypochondriack melancholy for says he the gout is generally caused by the too great drinking of fermented liquors and is never said to have assaulted any drinker of water and he says also that melancholy hypochondriack is kept off longest by drinking water instead of strong drink to which let me add that i once knew a gouty gentleman who to avoid his drinking companions in london retired to new brentford where i then lived in which town by a very temperate diet of one meal a day and drinking only water he lived two whole years free from pain but being visited by one who came that way and invited to drink but one bottle of claret between them he fell next day into a terrible fit of the gout which held above a month after of which being recovered he by the same course continued well till i left the place which was about a year and a half after  the good properties of water are further manifested in preventing the breeding of gravel in the kidneys for zechias in consult    as he is quoted by salmon affirms that nothing does so much abate the heat of the kidneys and free them from those recrements which cause pain in the back one great sign of gravel as water does but he advises to drink it warm by the use of which he says the unnatural heat in time will be so extinguished that no more of that matter causing gravel will be produced in the body which assertion by experience i have found to be true for observing much gravel to be voided by me as also abundance of matter floating in the urine like bran with a great number of recrements like cuttings of hair some above an inch long which substances were found in all the water i made in above twelve months for which i could get no remedy i was advised to drink water which in about half a year did entirely free me from those symptoms which some imputed to witchcraft out of ignorance so that from that time to this present i never have been troubled with it  water also is commended as efficacious to prevent the breeding of the stone in the bladder for it has been observed that in some who have been cut for the stone that new stones have been ingenderd so that some young persons have been cut several times now to prevent this the drinking water has been advised with success for by this that intemperate heat in the body was abated which did occasion the distemper some have advised to drink it warm and others cold and in particular van heydon a physician of ghent in flanders in his book entitled help for the rich and poor which he says in p    is sufficiently insinuated by piso and alexander who do assure us that the taking a draught of cold water in the morning has done so much good that several after the voiding of a stone never had any more stones grow in them  which experiment may give light to the discovery of a way to cure the stone without cutting for if the growing of new stones can be prevented by drinking water let it be hot or cold it may prevent a stone from growing bigger when begun and if the aiding matter to increase a stone new begun can be prevented nature in time may waste that which is begun especially if some drops of sweet spirit of nitre be added to all the water drank which will powerfully help to cool and is known to be an admirable mover or provoker of urine and will waste a stone and make it crumble like fullers earth if applied to a stone taken from the body or the water may be sweetened with honey which is now much in use among the gentry as i am informed by an ingenious apothecary who told me that among them at present pumpwater and honey was in great repute to give ease in gravel and there is so near an affinity between gravel and the stone that what is proper for one will be suitable to both and will prevent the growing of both  water is also styled in sennertuss works the balsam of children the drinking of it by the mother being one of those things whereby children may be strengthened in the womb and will prevent those injuries that are done them by drinking strong liquors which sampsons mother was not allowed to do for she was commanded not to drink wine or strong drink judge     but i will not say if all women should do this their children shall be as strong as sampson was yet this i will say if they would do this they would find their children more free from distemper and frowardness and so much more easy to nurse and bring up and be less liable to an immature death the want of which abstinence from strong drinks is the cause why so many rich people find it hard to bring up children in comparison to what is done by the poor for these last are born of mothers who not only are prevented from being gluttons by their want of dainties which are deceitful meat prove     but they seldom taste wine or strong drink whereas the rich not only feed high and so engender foul blood but they also drink strong drinks which in most constitutions do overheat the humors of the body and that blood by which their children are nourished during their pregnancy which injury to unborn infants would be prevented if the mother would be temperate in diet and drink water especially at meals by which the blood of the mother would be kept cool and clean which must needs communicate a healthful substance to the child within her and prevent all those distempers which infants do bring with them into the world  and here it may be proper to add what by diverse experiments has been found to be true that the drinking water by nurses while they give suck to children will wonderfully increase milk in those that want it as every one will find who can be persuaded to make use thereof i have advised many to make use of it who have found that by drinking a large draught of water at bedtime they have been supplied with milk sufficient for that night when before they wanted it and could not be supplied by any other means and besides they who have found their children restless by reason of too much heat in their milk do find them much more quiet after their milk is cooled by waterdrinking  by drinking water also the want of food for a time may be suffered without starving for i have been informed by a credible friend who was an officer at sea that being sent down to stafford to take care to see some men conveyed on shipboard that had deen pressed by act of parliament for the seaservice he found in the prison where they were kept a lusty fellow who had declared he would starve himself rather than go to sea and taking particular notice thereof he found upon due enquiry that for twenty days he had refused to eat any manner of food only he drank each day about three pints or two quarts of water hoping thereby to get himself discharged but when he found his pretensions to be in vain and that in about two days they should all march for london he condescended to eat some food beginning with a little and in the march he was observed to travel as well as the best man i find also an account in dr cars letters of a certain crackbraind man who at leyden when the doctor resided in that university pretended he could fast as long as christ did and it was found that he held out the time of forty days without eating any food only he drank water and smoked tobacco and i once had a sad complaint from a poor old woman of the greatness of her want affirming that oftentimes she had not eaten any food for two or three days upon which i asked her if she did not then suffer much uneasiness in her stomach she said she did but found a way at last to assuage her hunger by drinking water which did satisfy her appetite  water is also of great use to strengthen weak children for we are informed by dr joseph brown in his treatise of cures performed by cold baths that the welsh women do preserve their children from the rickets by washing them night and morning in cold water till they are three quarters of a year old p    and it is said by sir john floyer in his treatise of cold baths that a lady in scotland who had lost several children through weakness did by the advice of a highland beggarwoman preserve those she had afterward by washing them daily in cold water and i myself did advise a neighbor whose child began to be ricketty to treat the child in the same manner but she instead of washing dipped it over head and ears every morning it being then in the summertime the event of which was the child became strong and had a good countenance tho before it was in the face very pale and wan which shows how great the power of water is when used outwardly to invigorate the spirits and strengthen nature  it is also a known custom to prevent the swellings that follow bruises in the faces of children by immediately applying thereunto a linen cloth four or six times double dipped in cold water and new dipping it as it begins to grow warm for the cold repels or prevents the flowing of humors to the part which otherwise would cause great swelling and after turn blackish and if upon neglecting to do so a swelling should succeed it may be discussed by fomenting night and morning for an hour at a time with water as hot as can be endured for that will give vent to the humors to transpire through the skin or dissolve them so as to make them capable of returning back  moreover by means of water all sickness at the stomach may be cured which is done thus take four quarts of water make it as hot over the fire as you can drink it of which water let a quart be taken down at several draughts then wrap a rag round a small piece of a stick till it is about the bigness of a mans thumb tie it fast with some thread and with this by endeavoring gently to put it a little way down your throat provoke yourself to vomit up again most of the water then drink another quart and vomit up that and repeat the same the third and fourth time you may also provoke vomiting by tickling your throat with your finger or the featherend of a goosequill but the cloth round a skuer makes one vomit with most ease which is done with no trouble when the stomach is full and by this way of vomiting which will be all performed in an hours time that vicious and ropy phlegm in the stomach which causes the sickness will be cast up so that the party in that time will be free from all that inward disturbance if you use the remedy at the first but if the sickness has continued for a time it will require the same course once or twice more which may be done in three or four hours one after another without any other inconvenience besides that of being a little sore in the breast the next day which will soon go off by the force of nature which remedy by forty years experience i look upon to be infallible in all sickness at the stomach from what cause soever and for all pains in the belly which seem to be above the navel for these are all in the stomach as by long experience i have found which pains are generally counted the cholick but it is not so for true cholicks are always below the navel in the gut colon and by this means i have eased very great pains caused by eating mussels that were poisonous and it is also a certain cure for all surfeits or disorders that follow after much eating so that the lives of multitudes might be saved by this means who for want of expelling what offends do often die in misery for by thus cleansing the stomach at the first the root of diseases proceeding from surfeiting unwholesome food or any viscous humors from a bad digestion are prevented the stomach being the place in which all distempers do at first begin no man was more subject to sickness than myself before thirty years of age but since i found out the way of vomiting with water which is now above forty years i never have been sick for two days together for when i find myself ill to any great degree i betake myself to this way of vomiting which in an hours time restores me to ease and perfectly removes my illness and the same benefit all my family find in it as do others also whom i can persuade to try the experiment which is such that no physician whatever can advise a better to the king himself should he fall sick for in the first place it is not a nauseous remedy it does not make the patient sick as the best of all other vomits do and then it is a vomit which is at our own command since we can leave off when we please and it infallibly works a cure to all sick stomachs  some few indeed pretend they are not able to vomit by this means now if they cannot vomit let them take a pint of water when they find themselves ill from eating and do so every three or four hours eating no more till they are hungry and they will find the water digest and carry off what was offensive the ingenious dr cheyne in his treatise of the gout does affirm that warm water drank freely in a morning fasting and at meals  and i say cold water is as good has been a sovereign remedy for restoring lost appetites and strengthening weak digestions when other more pompous medicines have failed and he advises gouty persons after excess either in meat or drink to swill down as much fair water as their stomach will bear before they go to bed whereby they will reap these advantages either the contents of the stomach will be thrown up or both meat and drink will be much diluted and the labor and expense of spirits in digestion much saved and indeed i have found by long experience that nothing causes so good a digestion as fair water but this requires time to free us from the uneasiness that an ill digestion causes whereas vomiting is an immediate remedy and frees a man from it upon the spot  we are told by sir john floyer in his treatise of bath and mineral springs that vomiting with water is very useful in the gout sciatica wind shortness of breath hypochondriack melancholy and falling sickness which distempers are generally derived from evil matter contained in the stomach as is likewise giddiness in the head and apoplexies with which myself once seemed to be threatened for after eating a plentiful dinner i was seized with giddiness and the sight of my eyes became so depraved that things seemed double which was accompanied with a strange consternation of spirit and having read that apoplexies generally seize after eating i immediately called for water and not daring to stay till it was warmed i drank it cold and by the help of my finger provoked vomiting upon which i did immediately overcome the evils i was threatened with the symptoms before mentioned being the same as did precede the fit of an apoplexy in another person as himself afterward told me who died of it the third fit  as for people who are troubled with shortness of breath it is certain from experience that vomiting with warm water three or four times will afford certain relief and the same may be prevented by drinking nothing but water afterward either cold or warmed with a toast for upon doing this the difficulty of breathing will apparently abate which water if you please may be boiled with honey and i knew one who by this means as he was advised by me lived comfortably in this city two or three winters but having undertaken business which did occasion drinking strong drinks was the next winter carried off by the distemper wine ale or brandy being as bad as poison to people troubled with shortness of breath  some people are taken with violent vomiting and the excess thereof in some has been so great as to endanger their lives yea cause death in which case water will be very helpful for if a pint of it warmed be drank after every vomit it will prevent that violent straining wherein lies the danger of all vomiting because to strain violently when but little will come up does endanger the breaking of some inward vessel and besides this the offending matter will be sooner loosened from the internal part of that bowel the stomach and cast out upon which the vomiting will sooner cease for after this manner the famous sydenham a most honest writer did overcome the cholera morbus or vomiting and looseness so common in his time and was found by the weekly bill to kill more than now die of convulsions for his way was to boil a chicken in four gallons of water which made a broth not much differing from water of which he ordered large draughts to be given and some of it to be taken by clyster till the whole quantity was spent if the vomiting did not stop before which did so take off the sharpness of the matter offending and wash it out that the party in a little time became well and the same was the practice of sigismundus grasius who commends pure water in a vomiting and looseness to be drank in large quantities for thereby he says the corrosive or sharp humors will be so weakened that they will no more offend and he faith it may be drank cold if the patient be strong otherwise let it be warmed  and in common fluxes without vomitings a quart or more of warm water drank will so weaken the sharpness whereby the distemper is caused that it will soon be overcome and the gripings eased and in the bloody flux which is the most dangerous of all fluxes the ingenious cornelius celsus advises a large drinking of cold water as the best of remedies but then no other substance must be taken till the disease is cured and another great physician by name lusitanus affirms cent   obser    that he knew one who being in the summertime afflicted with this bloody flux did drink a large quantity of cold water and did thereby recover this large quantity therefore of water in these fluxes does so correct the sharpness of the humor offending that it can have no power to cause pain or corrode the vessels and cause bloody digestions or stools  water also is a drink that conduces above all things to cure consumptive people for the digestion being weakened is the cause of producing a hot fretting nourishment which is injurious to the tender substance of the lungs and which constringes and stops up the lymphatick vessels through which the nourishment is to pass to all the parts so that by degrees the body for want of due supplies consumes which obstructions and that acrimony that causes them will be opened and sweetened by the plentiful use of water if taken before the lungs become ulcerous which cure of consumptions by water is recommended in the writings of dr couch who in his praxis catholica tells us that he knew a man cured very soon of a consumption by drinking pure water and it is said by another that some have been cured of consumptions by drinking no other drink but water avoiding all malt liquors and sharp wines for wine or any other strong liquor is pernicious in this distemper  some there are who are much troubled with flushing heat in their face and others with a heat in the back in both which cases water used as common drink is the best remedy with a spare cooling diet and it is also excellent for such as have red blotches in their face which proceeds from a hot fretting blood which by waterdrinking and a moderate diet will be kept under for as dr duncan before quoted does affirm those who keep their blood cool and clean are never troubled with breakings out like many others who may be known to be drinkers of hot drinks and use a hot full diet by their faces  water is also commended by the learned for the cholick thus riverius affirms that in the cholick large drinking of water has been found to be an excellent remedy and it is said by fortis that when he practiced at venice he often gave cold water in the cholick with good success with whom an english physician dr wainwright in his mechanical account of the six nonnaturals concurs for he says that waterdrinkers are never troubled with the cholick and that many thereby have been cured when all other remedies failed  and in the smallpox water has also been proved to be an excellent drink salmon in his synopsis medicinae says that in this distemper you may safely give the sick fair water of which says he they may drink liberally to quench thirst the want of which plenty of drink has been the death of many a patient which opinion of his was right as by experience i have found in two of my own children when sick of this distemper to whom after i had given a gentle vomit of emetick tartar i gave no other drink but water and they both recovered safely and were not in the least lightheaded as two others before were in the same distemper when treated otherwise and i remember that one dr betts being consulted in a case where the eruptions did not come out kindly did order two quarts of cold water to be drank as soon as could be upon which they came out according to expectation and the party did well  it is also certain that in what we call burning fevers water is found to be a safe and effectual remedy it is said by dr primrose in his popular errors that many great physicians have commended the drinking cold water in diseases and they attribute to it the chief place in fevers where the sick must drink largely for thus taken it will quench all heat page     and galen is said by an english author to reprove crasistratus for denying cold water in burning fevers and says that this is a remedy for any fever provided it be drank in great abundance with which opinion i find dr oliver to agree who in his essay on fevers says that in fevers we must drink oftener than thirst calls for it and such draughts as are plentiful and the drink he prescribes is either cold water or barleywater dr wainwright affirms also that water is proper in fevers and that the ancients gave as much of it as the patient could drink and by another it is said that if you give the patient nothing but water for three days that in the third day the fever will be cured generally but if it is not give for food a little barleybroth and the fever will not exceed the seventh day and by another we are informed how one in a fever that was past hope being forbidden to drink water which he greatly desired did find means in the absence of his nurse to get a large potfull which he drank off and lay down again being well cooled after which he fell into a sweat and so was cured and i find that dr cook of warwick in his book of observations on english bodies does prescribe for the cure of fevers first a vomit and afterward as much cold water as the patient can drink and he says that if he sweat upon it the sweat must he continued as long as can be and it is said by another that it is an excellent remedy in fevers to drink a quart of hot water and sweat upon it being covered warm there is also one dr quinton who in his book of observations writes that to one in a malignant fever whose pulse was so low it could scarcely be felt there was three quarts of water given at several draughts to make him vomit but it did not operate that way yet the event was this that it did refresh him much raised his pulse brought him into a breathing sweat and passed off by urine which lowness of the pulse my own experience has often found to be raised by drinking water plentifully and i know a woman who though she in a fever had the advice of two doctors yet became distracted i bid the nurse give her a pint of cold water which she drank up and in three or four minutes came to her right senses and desiring to drink more she recovered and i have observed that when in fevers the patient can relish no other drink yet water is always drank with pleasure as it also will always be after the eating sweet things that spoil the relish of other drinks which is one excellence peculiar to water and shows it to be most agreeable to the nature of mankind though now so much slighted  and as for the gout which dr harris says in his antiempirice is gotten either by high feeding or drinking much wine or other strong drink it may be cured as that author does affirm by a very spare diet and drinking water according to what is said also by sir theodore mayhern who in his medicinal counsels advises to leave off all strong drinks in this disease and drink only water and van heydon says also in his treatise of help for the rich and poor that there is not any greater remedy for the gout than drinking water not only by young but old men many of whom he says have drank cold water for many weeks which has succeeded so well though they were far gone in years that they found great ease thereby without that offense to the stomach or hindrance of digestion which some did seem to fear and he also commends the large drinking of water in the sciatica or hipgout he having often cured this distemper by this means in less time than could reasonably be expected and the same myself have found to be effectual in a like pain in the shoulder which had continued very bad for three months for being taken with a fever i drank in one day about four quarts of water which though it did not make me sweat because i lay not in my bed yet it cured me so that i slept well that night and in the morning when i rose i did find that the pain in my shoulder was not felt neither did it ever return and the same success i have had in the pains of other parts whereby i judge that in all pains whatever the drinking of water is proper as well as in the gout and accordingly i find cold water advised to be drank largely for the cure of the headache from hard drinking that pain proceeding from the same cause the gout does namely from heat as all pains do  it is said also by dr wainwright that in the itch scurvy leprosy and in all hot inflammatory distempers such as pleurisies rheumatisms and st anthonys fire water is a proper remedy but he advises to drink it hot in some cases as doubtless ought to be done in pleurisies he also says that water is proper in headaches catarrhs vapors falling sickness dullness of sight melancholy shortness of breath scurvey in the mouth and windiness in the stomach and for wind in the stomach i by long experience have found it the best remedy who in the former part of my life through a disorderly diet and drinking strong drink like others was never free from windy belchings and sometimes very sickish qualms after meals from which at length i was delivered by drinking only water at meals so that for above forty years i have been seldom troubled and if i find myself troubled a pint or more of cold water in less than half an hour will set me free by drinking of it  and that water is the best remedy for the mischiefs that come by hard drinking experience teaches there being nothing that so effectually frees from those nauseating and reaching qualms the next morning as the drinking a pint or more of fair water which effectually allays the inflammation of the bowels occasioned by strong or hot drink which spoils the strength of the stomach as it does the strength of all other parts nothing being a greater enemy to the vigor of the nerves and sinews since by much drinking men make themselves unable to stand or go which effect would never follow if liquors that abound with spirits were strengthening and if they were strengthening the fibers of the stomach would not be so weakened after drinking strong drinks as to make men sick which sickness will soon be recovered by the drinking cold water this being also the best remedy if taken largely for that heat of urine which is often occasioned by harddrinking  in colds water is the best of all drinks to prevent floods of rheum from the nose and mouth as my long experience testifies and the drinking thereof will prevent coughs for a cough will seldom succeed a cold if water is used from the first as common drink and if through neglect a cough should become troublesome the use of water avoiding all wine and strong drink will contribute much to the cure some order the water to be drank warm but others say that to drink it cold vastly excells the using of it hot in a cough it is said by van heydon that some may think it strange to advise water in such diseases which most do account to proceed from crudity or indigestion but he says that in any disease where the case is dangerous the use of water is the only friend to nature cold water being a preventer rather than a cause of crudity since by all experience it is proved to be a promoter of a good digestion and at this time i know a woman    years of age who for this ten years has had a great cough and spits much tough phlegm that has this present winter      been persuaded to leave off all strong and small fermented liquor and drink only water at meals and sometimes a dish or two of tea and has found herself much less subject to cough than before and scarce coughs at all in bed  it is the general opinion of most physicians that wine and strongdrinks are not proper for children and that the smaller and cooler their drink is the better it will be with them and that nothing conduces more to the health of children than drinking water which will prevent the foundation of those diseases that are caused in many by strongdrink and do show themselves in their more advanced age wherein many also do suffer much by the ill custom of making them gluttons by constantly cramming their stomachs with food many being thereby destroyed among the children of the rich before they come to the years of maturity when the children of poor country people who fare hard and very often drink water stand their ground till full grown for fewer children die in the country than in great cities where luxury in diet does more abound which is one reason why so few housekeepers in london were born in it the great supply of inhabitants being from the country children being brought up more hardy there than in london where great numbers are killed by overpleasing their palates which mischief would be in a great measure prevented by their being accustomed to drink water which by experience is found to make young children free from that frowardness which is commonly caused by a sharp and hot or feverish blood which ingendereth wind and causes pain and gripes for there is no pain but is the consequence of heat if it is not caused by blows and bruises  water i have found by long experience to be of excellent use in burns and scalds for in all burns and scalds that are slight if the part is plunged immediately into cold water the colder the better the pain will instantly be taken off and it will fetch out the fire if continued so long as will be required to do it by any other remedy and if the burn be so considerable that other remedies must be applied none of which will take off the smart of themselves in less than two or three hours yet if you apply cold water presently after other applications are made to the part the pain immediately will cease till the remedy becomes effectual so that the ease water will give in such cases makes it of good use which remedy as it has not been discovered till now appears to transcend all other remedies in this case because in a moment the great smart will be eased if the water is cold and will be felt no more if the part afflicted be kept immersed in it till the fire is extinguished either by the water or the medicine applied besides it is a remedy every where ready at hand which cannot be said of any other which generally requires so much time to get it ready that much pain will be endured if blisters do not arise which do much increase the trouble if the part burnt or scalded cannot be dipped in water you may apply water to it with double linen cloths dipped therein and new dipped as they grow warm by which means i have cured burns and scalds in the face without blistering when applied immediately before blisters did arise  i once knew a large ulcer in the foot made by the running of melted brass into the shoe that was kept in hand by a surgeon nine weeks without any probability of healing because of the great inflammation that attended it but the party being a lover of angling was persuaded to go with some others to hackney river some of them went bareleggd into the water to come at a certain hole where much fish was sometimes found the sport was so good that the lame man having pulled off his stockings and plasters went in also where he staid above two hours and coming out again he found the ulcer which appeared very red and angry when he went in did look pale he put on his dressings and came home and in lose than a fortnight his ulcer healed up which doubtless was occasioned by the abating of the inflammation by the coldness of the water and i have had an account also from an acquaintance that was surgeon to a merchant ship that their gunner at a time when the captain treated some friends on board going to charge a gun that just before had been fired off the cartridge he was ramming down took fire whereby he was blown into the water and had some of his fingers torn off and it was about an hour before a boat could be got to take him up but they found that the coldness of the water had almost stopped the bleeding and the cure was effected so speedily that other surgeons wondered at it which he imputed to the water which kept back the humors by its coldness from flowing to the part at the first so that there was no impediment from inflammation to hinder healing for the chief impediment to healing is inflammation in wounds or ulcers  and as for strains and sprains in the joints cold water affords the best and most speedy remedy as van heydon affirms who says that by bathing in cold water all harm so received may by this remedy be cured more safely and more speedily than by any other without loss of time cost or trouble for no more is to be done than as soon as can be to put the part into a tub of cold water for about two hours which will prevent all swelling and pain by repelling or keeping back the humors that otherwise would flow to the part and if it should be the shoulder or any other part which is so hurt that cannot well be immersed in water after this manner water may be applied by dipping towels folded up into it and laying them to the part as is done in effect to the wrenched joints of horses about which if you wind oftentimes a thick rope made of hairs and then cast upon it diverse times a pail of cold water the wrench will be cured which experiment is now commonly practiced by those concerned about horses  bathing in cold water has also been found to be a good remedy to strengthen weakness in the joints as sir john floyer in his treatise of cold bathing has showed and which by experience i found to be true in a certain woman who complained of great weakness and pain in her ankles i advised her to dip the part in cold water every morning for about a quarter of an hour and to do the same at night and in about twenty days she became as strong in that part as she was in the other and sir john tells us of a boy who could not stand his limbs were so weak that by bathing in cold water perfectly recovered his strength in a little time  great pain in the head has been also cured by this means for we are told by van heydon that one sir toby mathews had for twenty years been troubled with great pain in one side of his head and a great defluxion of rheum from his nose but he at last was cured by applying cold water to the part every day for about a quarter of an hour upon reading of which i tried the experiment upon myself who for a long time had been trouble with the running of much clear water from my nose with great spitting of thin rheum for i let a watercock run upon the mould of my head every morning by which in about six weeks time i was eased of my trouble and since that i had a credible information of a certain servantmaid who was afflicted greatly with a rheumatism and an intolerable pain in the head who being put into st thomass hospital her nurse was ordered by the doctor to apply to her head towels four times double dipped in cold water changing them as they became warm which she was to continue doing four or five hours in which time she was freed from that pain in the head and was afterward cured of the rheumatism by other means  the want of sleep in fevers may be cured likewise by the application of cold water for to a near relation who could not sleep for three days and three nights i ordered a towel to be several times folded up then to be dipped in water and a little wrung out an so laid upon her forehead and to be new dipped as it grew hot which in about two hours time so coold her head that she fell into a sleep and conti in it five hours and i ordered the farce to be done the next night with the some effect and we find that dr cokbun in his treatise of sea diseases dd order for the want of sleep in fevers to dip a towel four times doubled in oxycrat which is six parts water and one part vinegar to be bound about the head and temples which he says will cause sleep with wonderful success but water only will have the same effect as i often have proved  and that the use of cold water in swoonings is of great effect common experience teaches for if a dish or cup of cold water is thrown strongly upon the face the person in an instant will recover his senses tho for a time he seems dead and perhaps might not have recovered in some cases if cold water had not been so applied such faintings being sometimes deadly which proceed from possonous vapors ascending up to the brain from a foul stomach for such effects there are as i have found by experience who in my young days did swoon away twice at both which times i was sensible of a collection of wind in my stomach from whence i plainly felt a fume or vapor ascend to the head that in an instant deprived me of all sense but being both times in the company of a person who had seen the thing tried he dashed some cold water against my face which i remember made me start as if i had been suddenly a waked and i am apt to think that some die in such a fit when none are near to help them and especially when so taken in their sleep which i believe none need fear who live temperately or that eat no suppers none who have refrained from suppers having been ever found to die in sleep  dangerous bleedings at the nose have also been cured with cold water largely drank syringing cold water up their nostrils and applying towels round their necks dipped in cold water changing them as they grow warm for it is said by a good writer that this will so cool the heat of the blood and by the coldness of the water syringed up the nose so contract the mouths of the bursted veins which bleed that it will put a stop to the bleeding such bleedings have also been stopped by dashing cold water often into the face as a french writer has affirmed whose name was flamand and the same also is affirmed by cook in his marrow of surgery  cold water is an absolute cure for all small cuts in the fingers or other parts for if when cut you close the cut up with the thumb of your other hand keeping it so closed for a quarter or half an hour this will infallibly stop the bleeding after which if you double up a linen rag five or six times dip it in cold water and apply it to the part binding it on fast this by preventing inflammation and a flux of humors will give nature time soon to heal it without any other application as is seen in the common practice of surgeons when they let a man blood for all the application they make to the vein so cut is a pledget of linen dipped in cold water and bound on with a fillet for all wounds without loss of substance will heal of themselves if inflammation is prevented and the lips of the wound are kept close together  we also are told by van heydon that in his time some were of an opinion that a person bit by a mad dog might be preserved from that symptom called the fear of water which generally follows and proves so mortal by applying cold water to the place bitten and this he says they conceive to be no unlikely thing if there is any credit to be given to what cornelius celsus writes who says that the only remedy in this case is to throw the party who is in this condition or has the fear of water upon him into a pond or river and when plunged over head and ears to keep him in the water till filled with it whether he will or no and by this means both his thirst and dread of water will be cured for if this immersion be of use when the party is so far gone why should it not be of greater force in preserving from it if speedily applied and repeated now tho this is mentioned by him as a probable opinion yet experience in our days shows that the plunging the patient into the salt water either of the river of thames about gravesend or in the salt springs in cheshire is an infallible means to prevent any evil succeeding the bite of a mad dog they must indeed be dipped so often as to be almost drowned before the danger is over but it is a question whether the saltness of the water contributes any thing to this cure since boer have the present professor at leyden affirms that when men bitten by a mad dog are arrived to the fear of water called an hydrophobia they may be cured by blinding the patients eyes and throwing of him into a pond of water often till he seems not to be afraid of it or but very little and then force him to drink large quantities  and we are told by dr brown that a person troubled with the falling sickness by happening to fall into a cold spring i suppose it was in the time of his fit was freed from his distemper all his life after and he says there is no need of preparing the body for it in this as in some other cases but the patient when plunged into a cold bath ought to continue in the bath each time about three or four minutes for in plunging over head and ears at his first entrance into a cold bath the brain will be so sensibly affected as to be relieved from the distemper which is a kind of convulsion proceeding from an inflammation or some other cause but we want more experiments to confirm this notion which notion may be worth noting that the thing may be tried in others to see whether it will succeed as it did in this person for it is said by the ingenious dr pitcairn a scotchman some time professor at leyden that there is no such thing as the art of physic but remedies were found out by chance p     of his works for if physic were an art as certain in its rules as the rules are that belong to music or to watchmaking physicians would as seldom be mistaken in their prescriptions as the others are in their designs but when remedies happen to be discovered and prove often to be effectual the remembering that remedy to apply it in a like case often brings reputation to the prescriber and if it fails some other experiment must be tried which were physic an art need not be done  it is also said by the same dr brown that madness and melancholy with all their retinue may find better effects from the use of bathing in cold water than from other violent methods with which people so afflicted are now treated for says he that which will make a drunken man sober in a minute will certainly go a great way toward the cure of a madman in a month now it is most certain to my own knowledge that if a drunken man be plunged over head and ears in cold water he will come out of it perfectly sober and some i have known that in such cases have been recovered by barely washing their heads in cold water and the forementioned opinion of dr brown is confirmed by the practice of dr blair who in a letter to dr baynard declares that he cured a man raving mad who being bound in a cart stripped of his clothes and blindfolded that the surprise might be the greater he on a sudden had a great fall of water let down upon him from the height of twenty foot under which he continued so long as his strength would permit and after his return home he fell into a sleep and slept twentynine hours and awaked in as quiet a state of mind as ever and so had continued to the time of the writing that letter which was twelve months  which relation seems to make that a more probable truth which was related in a letter from sir john floyer to dr brown and printed by that doctor wherein it is said that in normandy they immerse fools or dip them in cold water to cure them a hot brain being the cause perhaps of several disorders in the understanding and is in great part found to be true in the ridiculous behavior of some drunken men which when their heads are become cool abhor what they before did do or say now if such dipping would cure fools among us great numbers might be made more happy than they are  dr brown in his discourse of cold baths affirms likewise that to bathe in cold water has been found to be the quickest safest and pleasantest cure for the kings evil and he tells us in p    of a yorkshire gentleman who was grievously afflicted with this distemper having great ulcers in the glands of his neck which were so much inflamed as to bring him very low but being advised by dr baynard to bathe in the cold bath he in a months time was perfectly cured his ulcers being healed up contrary to the opinion of the most learned physicians  we also find mention in the description of the scottish islands of an odd remedy commonly made use of there for the cure of the jaundice which is this they strip the party naked lay him upon the ground on his belly and pour unawares upon his back a pail of cold water and also pains in the joints as dr curtis tells us will be cured by holding the part under the stream of a pump or cock and fomenting with cold water is commended as good to assuage hot swellings and i know a person who had often been subject to bloodshot or inflamed eyes who afterward upon the beginning of the same distemper took by advice a ball of linen rags dipped them in cold water and applied them to the part cooling them by new dipping as often as they grew hot which application was continued three hours in which time the humor was so repelled as to be troublesome no more for the party to my knowledge has had no sign of that distemper since tho the same had been very troublesome many times before  it is also advised by dr gideon harvey to wash the eyes well twice a day in cold water as the best remedy to prevent defluxions on them and preserve the eyesight which it greatly comforts and this i have found true for many years my eyes being often apt to be dim and stiff on a sudden so that i could scarce open my eyelids which upon washing for a minute with fair water has been felt no more till a good while after besides which benefit to the eyes authors say it is also good to preserve the memory if the whole forehead be washed twice a day which is a certain cure for itching in the eyes as authors tell us  some people are troubled with a callosity or hardness of the bottoms of their feet which is so troublesome as to be a hindrance to their easy walking for which a cure is prescribed by dr cook that is to soak them well in warm water till the hardness is softened and then scrape it off with the edge of a knife and if the feet burn with any unnatural heat the bathing often in hot water will cool them by giving vent to what offends  and the plentiful drinking of water is commended in the scurvey by dr pitcairn to dissolve the scorbutic salts and carry them out by urine whether they are acids or alkalies and myself having formerly been extremely troubled with the scurvey which often made me faint and weak and my pulse so low as scarcely to be felt i found at last that the pulse would infallibly rise upon drinking a pint or more of cold water and in a little time i should become brisk and strong for i have often found that upon a disorder of the stomach the strength of the bodily members soon would fail and would easily be recovered when the disorder of the stomach was removed and have by long experience found that nothing conduces so much to bodily strength as a stomach in right order which requires temperance and cooling drink  to what has been already said i will add an account taken from a credible person of a man in the parish of shoreditch who was desperately ill of an asthma or shortness of breath and deep consumption for which he had tried many remedies to no purpose at length he was advised by a physician being poor to drink no other drink but water and eat no other food but water gruel without salt or sugar which course of diet he continued for three months finding himself at first to be somewhat better and at the three months end he was perfectly cured but for securitysake he continued in that diet a month longer and grew strong and fat upon it but his diet he had no mind to till he was thoroughly hungry and then he eat with pleasure in which perhaps consisted the best part of his cure it being an advantage to health never to eat till hunger calls for food  and i remember a young woman who was a burnisher of silver who had a desperate cough for which she had taken many things of an apothecary to no purpose at length the journey man told her his master said he could do more but said the fellow i would advise you every morning to wash about and behind your ears and upon your temples and on the mould of your head with cold water which she told me she did and in about a weeks time was perfectly cured of her cough  there are diverse other cases where in the use of water has done much good i knew an ancient practiser in physic who told me that in many difficulties of making water he had advised the party to put his yard into water as hot as he could endure it which in a minute did cause him to make water and that women have had the same benefit by sitting over hot water and he often had advised them who were costive and went to stool with great difficulty to set over a pot with hot water in it which soon was attended with an easy digestion the body drawing up the vapor which did provoke expulsion without much straining  and it has been observed that froward children have been made much more quiet by washing their lower parts every morning with water to wash off the fretting salts of their urine which usually stick in the pores of the skin and are fretful and uneasy and nothing cures their soreness about those parts like it nor is there are any thing more effectual to cure men who are gauled with riding than to wash themselves well when they go to bed with cold water and washing the bare breast and neck every morning with cold water will make those hardy who before were apt at every turn to take cold  in short water when rightly made use of does appear from the accounts beforementioned very effectual to prevent and cure many diseases but more especially the inward use thereof for to use the words of the ingenious dr curtis in his essay for the preservation and recovery of health the habitual use of water for common drink preserves the native ferment of the stomach in due order keeps the blood temperate and helps to spin out the thread of life to the longest extent of nature it makes the rest at night more quiet and refreshing the reason and understanding more clear the passions less disorderly and in case of eating too much a large draught of cold water vastly exceeds any other cordial to cause digestion water being not so cold and lifeless he says as many do imagine besides which commendation of it by this doctor it is certainly a drink that will not ferment in the stomach nor turn sour as wine and strong malt drinks will do to the hindering of a good digestion which all acidity in the stomach certainly does when it abounds there and is best corrected by weakening or making it less sour by drinking good store of water as the experience of above forty years practice has assured myself and many others for tho water is counted a contemptible drink yet by beginning to make use of it at about thirty years of age before which i was often out of order and continuing the use of it ever since drinking very little wine or strong drink i have attained to the age of seventyfour years when thousands in the mean time who delight only in drinking strong beer wine and brandy have not lived half so long which makes good that saying in the scriptures that wine is a mocker and strong drink is raging and he who is deceived thereby is not wise prove  0  since it no ways contributes to long life for it is certain that thousands in the world live as long who drink no strong drink as any drinkers of it do some indeed from an extraordinary strength of nature have been hard drinkers and yet die old but for one who does this perhaps an hundred are destroyed by it before they come to half the time of life and generally we shall find that very strong and healthy constitutions at the long run are ruined by riot and excess there being no certain safety in any way of living but that of temperance and moderation nature in some may a long time withstand the abuses offered to it but at last it will yield to its enemies and those who live the longest in an intemperate course might from the strength of their constitution have lived much longer had they eat less and used themselves to drink more water which drink as it is most friendly and longest will preserve the life of a strong constitution so it is absolutely necessary for those that are weak and sickly and are naturally subject to the gout the stone shortness of breath wind ill digestion and such like  but the chief use of water in preserving of health is by using of it as a vomit as before was shown which is the most infallible remedy that ever was found out for any stomachsickness or pain there for to vomit with warm water will effectually remove it and be a means to prevent great fits of sickness and preserve the lives of many thousands to old age by cleansing the stomach from that tough slimy or corrupt matter that offends and is the cause of all mortal diseases especially of an apoplexy which though counted a disease of the head yet has its original from a foul stomach which nothing does so effectually cleanse as vomits according to that of dr curtis who says that vomiting with warm water or carduus tea is very beneficial to bring up that which fluctuates in the stomach and that tough ropy phlegm which sticks fast to the wrinkles and foulds of that bowel and which purges do often pass over and cannot remove which way of vomiting with warm water is ten times more easy and pleasant than that which is effected by the use of a nauseous tea made of carduus which physicians do sometimes advise and it is also such as can do no harm by violence as other vomits made from antimony sometimes do  and here it may not be amiss to relate what i some years ago discovered in order to mens freeing themselves from sickness that may happen after eating for being invited to dine at a certain table where there were several good dishes of meat i was overpersuaded to eat more than i should do and in a little time after dinner found myself begin to be sick i went out and in a private place attempted to vomit by tickling my throat with my finger but could not vomit as i designed to do only by this means i raised up two or three mouthfuls of thick tough phlegm upon which i found myself better and my sick qualm went off i took the hint it gave me and have done the same several times since and find that the getting up the phlegm which like yest upon beer works up to the mouth of the stomach a man may free himself from some kinds of sickness after eating and i remember it is an advice given by one vaughan in a book long since printed entitled directions for health for men who feed high to put their finger in their throat when they rise in the morning to make themselves puke or avoid the phlegm which can be raised as an excellent way to preserve health and it is said also to be an absolute preservative from the gout  i will conclude with this note that in such distempers where waterdrinking will be available for a cure the same must not be drank sparingly but plentifully as to ease the gripings in a looseness or flux for if but a pint of water should be drank ease would hardly succeed but drinking in about an hours time a quart or three pints the sharpness and evil quality of the humor offending will be so far diluted or weakened that immediate ease will follow if the season be too cold to drink cold water you may warm it a little upon the fire or put a hot toast of bread into every pint and the same is true in fevers or in pains from gravel or the cholick for a small quantity will not be effectual in these cases which ought carefully to be noted for in a fever a little water will rather increase the burning which large draughts often drank will soon take off rest fasting and drinking much water after a vomit or two is a course that never yet has failed to cure fevers by clearing the stomach of that sordid filthiness which causes the distemper for a happy issue will certainly follow such a course if the fever is simple and not complicated with other distempers which will resist all remedies and in many cases nothing can prevent mortality as is evident by the death of the best physicians as well as others  i will add to what has been said one experiment more that is very material and that is being very hypochondriacal and of a melancholy temper i have often been strangely dejected in mind when under grief for some misfortunes which sometimes has been so great as to threaten danger to life in which fits of grief i always found the parts within my breast uneasy and sometimes they have continued long but now i have found a good remedy for upon drinking a pint of cold water i find ease in two or three minutes so that no grief seems to afflict which experience i discover for the sake of others in the same circumstances being verily persuaded that the seat of grief is in the stomach which sympathizeth with the mind and thereby becomes the cause of that uneasy sensation and pain perceived there for which cold water i have found to be the best remedy in myself and i believe others may find the same benefit who will make use thereof upon the like occasion  there is also another experiment that i have often seen of good effect and that is that if persons subject to what is called vapors or that are afflicted with fits commonly called the fits of the mother will but drink water when they find their fits approach it will immediately yield relief there is in this case a mealy julep prescribed by dr bates which is to take a spoonful of fine wheat flower an ounce of fine sugar and a pint of water brew them together and drink it off this is pleasanter than water alone but water of itself will be as effectual or rather better  some perhaps may desire to know how to distinguish good from bad water and the way to do this is by the taste and scent for if it have no taste nor smell being purely fresh not salt nor sweetish nor illscented it is good provided it be pure and clear of which kind is the common water used in london when well settled or in fair weather as for those who are curious and will be at the charge they may procure the best water for drink by distillation either in an alembick or in a cold still used in drawing any cold water from herbs for no earthy or metallic substance nor any kind of salt will rise in distillation so that the water so distilled will be pure and admirable to drink when cold and will keep as long from stinking as any of the colddistilled water in the apothecaries shops according to what dr quincy has affirmed about it in his dispensatory  those who have not the convenience of distillation may boil it a little as they do for tea for then when kept a while after it is cold in will become more fine by suffering any mixture contained in it to settle to the bottom of the vessel wherein it is contained and that will render it still more pure  since the collecting together the forementioned accounts i have met with a book written by dr boerhave the present professor of physic at leyden in holland who affirms that drinking water made very warm is a good remedy to pacify griping pains in the stomach and that it is proper to bathe wounds in the face with it when they come to be just healed so that the place be kept continually wet which i conceive is best done by applying often linen cloths wet and binding them on till they begin to be dry will prevent scars and he says that warm water is better to attenuate or thin the blood than cold water  there is also published a book of experiments made with water by dr hancock a divine called febrisugum magnum wherein he says that drinking a pint or a quart of cold water in bed will raise a copious sweat and cure all burning fevers which at once taking has done the business it will raise a sweat without much more covering than ordinary and he further affirms that the same taken at the beginning of the cold fit of an ague and sweating upon it at two or three times taking will cure that distemper a large quantity of hot water i know has been advised to hinder the cold fit but the party was not ordered to sweat  and he says he has had long experience of curing common colds with cold water and this is done by drinking a large draught of water at going to bed another in the night and another in the morning which he says will soon thicken and sweeten and digest that thin sharp rheum that provokes coughing to no purpose for the rheum when thin is hard to be brought up but when thickened it will come up easily and the cough will soon go off which agrees with what i before affirmed from my own long experience  he also affirms from his own experience that using sometimes to take a walk of eight or ten miles in a morning he found that water gave twice as good breath for that purpose as wine or ale and if it would do this for a man who had no asthma he doubts not but it would do the same in one troubled with one and he also affirms water to be the best remedy for a surfeit to the truth of which i can testify by long experience  he also affirms that drinking cold water has been found good in rheumatisms and that to one so afflicted he had advised to drink it as he lay in his bed and it took off the fit but if hot water attenuates the blood most as boerhave affirms it is then best to drink of it warm daily to a good quantity for as pitcairn observes it is then the best dissolver of all kinds of salts in the body which it will carry off in the urine if drank plentifully for by urine all salts are evacuated  and it is his opinion from the long experience he has had of the effect of water in keeping the stomach in order and making it tight and strong to perform its operations and digest all humors that it will cure the gout in the stomach and perhaps it may do it better than wine which i have known to fail and i do not wonder that the same liquor which is the principal cause of the gout in other parts should not be a help in that part but rather kill as it often is found to do  in short he affirms and that with great reason that sweating in fevers by drinking cold water is more natural than to do it with hot sudorificks which often do harm in the beginning of fevers except good store of cooling moistening liquors are drank with them they being more apt to inflame than cool and quench heat in the body and for that reason it has not been often advised by physicians because they were ignorant of this cold way of sweating to cure fevers  which cure he said did succeed in one who was his relation at the fifth day after his falling sick to whom he gave a dose of water after he was in bed and he sweated profusely for    hours and thereby was cured half a pint he says is enough for a grown child a pint to a man or woman tho if they drink a quart it will be better in scarletfevers smallpox measles tho the water will not cause sweat yet it will so quell and keep under the fever that the eruptions will come out more kindly which is a confirmation of what before was said about dr bettss prescribing two quarts of water when the smallpox did not come out kindly  and he sets down an account of the author of the freethinker concerning a woman who in the last great plague fell ill of that distemper who got her husband to fetch her a pitcher of water from lambsconduit she drank plentifully of it but did not avoid the cold and so did not sweat however she was cured and he gives us another relation of an englishman formerly resident at morocco that fell ill of the plague at that place and getting water to drink fell into a violent sweat and recovered from whence he concludes that water is good in the plague  i will here add to what the doctor has said concerning the cure of fevers that if the fever be accompanied in the beginning with any illness at the stomach nauseating or vomiting it will be the surest and safest practice to clear the stomach first by vomiting with warm water as before has been prescribed for i cannot believe it possible for the stomach to be cleared from foul humors by sweating it may do if no great sense of disorder is perceived there but it will certainly be safest to cleanse the stomach first which is the place where all diseases are originally begun for then sweating with cold water afterward may turn to good account indeed i have not made any trial of it since the doctors book was published but i have a very good opinion of his experience upon all the accounts therein given concerning the benefit of water having had so much experience thereof in my own practice for above forty years for so long it is since i first began to collect those accounts and make those experiments which are herein made public for the benefit of all  and thus for the common good of mankind of all ranks and degrees i have collected together all the accounts i have observed in physickbooks relating to the use of common water in preventing and curing diseases to which i have added some experiments which by numerous trials i can warrant as sure and certain especially that of curing any sickness in the stomach upon the spot by vomiting with warm water which is an experiment that if put into common practice would prevent many thousand fits of sickness in a year among mankind and a great number of untimely deaths for it takes away the cause of all stomachsickness which is the root of or first beginning of most of the evils that afflict the body  i shall conclude all with this advertisement that if this finds a kind acceptance the author intends to publish a collection he has made out of the best writings relating to physic of such receipts as are most commended in all distempers and made up of the fewest ingredients and easiest to be had all reduced under their proper heads which i doubt not will prove very useful on many accounts beyond any collection of that nature the collection was begun above forty years since for my own use without any design originally to make them public but since we are not born for ourselves only i am persuaded to let others partake of the benefit of my labor if i can do it with the prospect of any suitable encouragement from the kind reception this may meet with among those who desire health which is best attained to by the most uncompounded remedies in times of sickness  some rules for preserving health by diet collected from physical authors in a little treatise entitled kitchinphysick written by dr cook the author declares he can hardly be told of any disease which he cannot relieve or cure by a proper diet p   and in the same book we find his opinion to be this that all tender sickly people and all aged and decrepid persons ought to eat often and but a little at a time because weak and wasted bodies are to be restored by little and little and by moist and liquid food also rather than by solid because moist and liquid diet does nourish soonest and digest easiest  those he says that eat much and get little strength by eating show that they have used themselves to too full a diet and the more you cramb such bodies the less they thrive by it but rather grow worse and worse because by much feeding you do but add to the bad humors wherewith the body is already filled which should rather be wasted by purging a little and using a spare diet  and a spare diet he describes to be this that we never eat at once till the appetite is fully satisfied and never to eat till you have an appetite and men never have a true appetite till they have a desire to eat any ordinary food or that a piece of bread will please the relish of the tongue and he advises to keep constantly to a plain diet for those he says enjoy most health and live longest that avoid curiosity and variety of meats and drinks which only serve to entice to gluttony and so work our ruin  another says that liquid meats are better for weakly people than solid and the less food the sick person eats the sooner he will recover for it is a true saying the more you fill foul bodies the more you hurt them the stomach being the place where diseases begin when that part therefore is weak and out of order and cannot make a good digestion raw or crude humors must needs be bred and bad humors cannot produce good blood  all men do find by experience that in the morning before they have eaten they are light and pleasantly easy in their bodies but after they have indulged their appetites with plenty of food they find themselves heavy and dull and often sleepy which sufficiently shows that those full meals are prejudicial to the welfare of the body for a moderate meal would have continued the ease and lightsomness they before found in themselves and would have refreshed any faintness that emptiness might occasion and he certainly who uses the most simple meats and drinks avoideth the snare of provoking his appetite beyond the necessities of nature whereas variety enticeth to a fresh desire of every dainty till at last the stomach is gorged and made incapable of performing a good digestion and this produces those crudities which are the cause of all diseases  it is generally observed that the most unhealthy among the gentry are those who feed high upon the most delicious dainties and drink nothing but the strongest and most spirituous liquors whereas the poor who want this delicate fare and never eat of their own plain diet to excess are seldom sick except they have such unsatiable appetites as to eat too much which a man may do of the plainest diet whose belly is his god  dr pratt advises to sup sparingly for to sup sparingly he says is most healthful because of the experience of an infinite number of persons who have received the greatest benefit from light suppers for the stomach being not overburdened the sleep is more pleasant and from sparing suppers the breeding of those humors are prevented which cause defluxions rheumatisms gouts dropsies giddiness and corruption in the mouth from the scurvey is prevented and from light suppers a freedom from sickness and reaching in the morning is obtained and concoction is made perfect which prevent obstructions  another says it is well known that many indispositions are cured by fasting or a very spare diet for what is taken into the stomach being no more than can be well digested the chylous juice so prepared is conveyed into the lacteal vessels and from thence into the blood so that nature being duly supplied with wellprepared nourishment the corrupted blood will get free from that corruption in time by throwing it out through the pores of the skin by perspiration and supply itself with the purer juices and in this way consumptions and scurveys and other chronical distempers will be overcome  that men in health may prevent diseases twas advised that one meal should not be eaten till the other which was eaten before was passed off clean out of the stomach which never is done till the appetite of hunger is found to call for another supply by means of which constant observation the food will be converted into good chyle and from good chyle which is a milky substance good blood will be bred and from good blood generous spirits will be produced out of which a healthy constitution will ensue but on the contrary too great a quantity of food being taken for pleasure only which the stomach cannot well digest the chyle will be raw and corrupt which will foul the blood and render the body disorderly and unhealthful  others say that abstinence and sobriety free from most dieases especially catarrhs coughs wheesings giddiness pain in the head and stomach sudden death lethargies gout and sciatica an ill digestion being the cause of all these it also prevents pain in the spleen stone and gravel and a dry itch it makes the body vigorous and nimble maintains the five senses in a good state preserves the memory quickens the wit and quenches all undue lust in mankind  two meals a day is sufficient for all persons after fifty years of age and all weak people for the omitting of suppers does always conduce much to the health of the weak and aged since if no supper be eaten the stomach will soon free itself from all tough slimy humors wherewith it is slabbered over on the inside and thereby the appetite will be renewed and digestion made more strong and vigorous moreover all that are troubled with sweating in the night any ill taste in their mouths belching and troublesome dreams must avoid suppers for in sleep the fibers of the stomach relax and are not able to contract themselves so strongly as when awake to embrace the food and by trituration reduce it into a pap fit to pass out into the other bowels called the guts out of which the nourishment is sent to other parts  twas said by dr curtis that though those who use a spare diet cannot well bear long labor yet such people when their exercise is suitable to their strength do live longer than those of a robust constitution that think large feeding adds strength especially such as being strong use no exercise proportionable to it to consume the superfluities which a full feeding does occasion which is the case of men of great estates who live longest to enjoy them and do good with them the more temperate they live  this temperance does consist in not letting the common custom of meals invite you to eat except your appetite concur with those times we must not indulge the cravings of a depraved appetite as those do who eat to please their fancy and not the necessities of nature and when we do eat we must not think that the more plentifully we eat we shall be more strengthened for it will not prove so a little well digested will make the body stronger than the being glutted with superfluity most of which will be turned into a corrupt juice and must be cast out or else sickness will ensue  it is the opinion of learned men that the early distemper of the body called the rickets proceeds from the fault of their mothers in making them gluttons from their cradles gorging them with food till they loath it out of a mistaken opinion that this is the way to make them thrive and grow strong which excess is not only the cause of this disease but of the immature death of many and in others it lays the foundation of many distempers which afflict them afterward who live to years of maturity and as they gorge them with food so they vainly think to cherish them with strong drink than which nothing can be more pernicious to the health of children whose diet should be little and often and their drink cooling as it also should be when they arrive at the time of becoming new children in old age that is in an helpless state which should be prevented as much as can be by a cooling moistening diet in opposition to the hot and dry and withered state of their second childhood for it is then heat and dryness that are the cause of most of their miseries and the wasting of the substance that fills the parts with moisture and keeps the body plump  it was the opinion of dr pit who was formerly physician to st bartholomews hospital that fasting rest and drinking water would cure most diseases and there seems to be a great deal of reason in what he asserted for fasting will give time to the stomach to unload itself of the cause of distempers the cause of all diseases being begun in that bowel only to which cleansing the drinking of water plentifully will much contribute which also will keep the action of the stomach upon the hinges by filling of it when empty at which time there will be need of rest for thereby the body will be less fit for business tho the mere drinking of water which affords nourishment sufficient for the growth and support of all vegetables will in some measure supply the want of food as has been shown in the example of two who were supported a long time by nothing else in short the best way for a sick man to recover is to eat no food till he finds an appetite according to that saying  spare diet will the most diseases cure if a due time you can the same endure and fasting from food may be continued long enough to be a remedy for many diseases by the assistance of common water by the drinking of which hot in a due quantity without a total fasting two persons i am informed were recovered out of consumptions by which they were extremely weakened and that in about six weeks time as was another by drinking milk and whey equal parts made blood hot without using any other diet which is thought to be far more effectual than asses milk  but besides a spare diet good cool dry air is also very helpful to preserve men in health for it mixes with the blood and without it the motion of the blood and spirits can never be preserved as appears by divingvessels in which men cannot live when the air therein is made hot by their own body and breath and is proved also by an experiment of dr crones who stifled a chicken till it seemed quite dead and yet by blowing cool air into the lungs with a small pair of bellows it revived hence it appears that the common custom of managing sick people is very pernicious and so far from helping them to recover that it is sufficient to make a healthy person sick for were a person who was not sick confined for three or four weeks in a room made hot like a stove and confined to his bed with the curtains drawn and all the windows close shut and perfumed with the nauseous fumes of physic which will almost make a fresh man sick when he just enters into it we can never think that this is the way to recover one that really is sick and wants the fresh air to cherish his blood a fresh open air being the principal means to strengthen the body make a good appetite and digestion and render the spirits brisk and lively which advantage should be allowed to all but childbed women and those who are afflicted with the smallpox for the fresh air can be prejudicial to no other whose bodies are clothed warm either in bed or sitting up  finis
