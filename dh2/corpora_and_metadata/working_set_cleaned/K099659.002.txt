well good sir i have read your play your opera i meant to say the style is simple plot quite new my head upon it it will do  poet your head upon it very right were that the case perhaps it might your head i mean what it contains the harmony that is in your brains we must you know as well as i please both alike the ear and eye your head must give the pleasing sound the audience hearing to confound whenever the verse is not so good as i would have it if i could  musician between us sir well make it bear  poet o trust me sir i dont despair should i succeed in playwright trade for it is the first i ever made i shall have reason then to crack  musician the first indeed faith you have a knack but give me leave to start a hint though you may think there is nothing in it in music sir there is a mode would you evade the common road in o let all your couplets end i tell you this now as a friend as some might say this line is fineo another cry that notes divineo good music sir is all the thing twill give your halting verse a wing my notes shall make your verses fly through pit through box and gallery and make the house with raptures roar encore encore encore encore   poet upon my word i do not fear it  musician no that you will not when once you hear it  poet faith you delight me  igad i vow i almost think i hear it now but who shall play the lovers part vernon you know is very smart  musician for vernon i would not give a souse t had better be at the other house mattocks you know is sweet and fine and little pinto most divine  poet it is true she gives a song its graces but then she makes such horrid faces arne was the only girl for me such life she had such harmony my ears devoured every note ere well they left her little throat her unaffected easy style did so bewitch and so beguile i was a statue all the while save that my heart made such a thumping as from my bosom it was jumping and vernon you must own has taste his action good his method chaste  musician well well we will not disagree whose part or this or that shall be twill prove our interest and our ends to join opinions and be friends and that we never may be foes another hint i will propose for it has always been my plan never to quarrel with a man whenever his interest shall combine and terminate alike with mine  poet i like your notion i confess for concord often brings success  musician indeed my worthy sir it is true it rests in me as well as you and by the self same rule agree it rests in you as well as me a method next i will lay you down whereby you will so bewitch the town the methods good nay it is true there is no method else will do be frequent in your repetitions it is the taste of all musicians and as your songs are yet unset i will tell you how videlicet suppose your verse should end in rapping or it might as well be tapping observe how quick the notes will move it i am sure you will not disapprove it here is the way it must begin but if i am out you will put me in what means this palpitation what means this palpitation what means this rapping and tapping rapping and tapping and rapping tapping and rapping and tapping rapping and tapping and rapping or should the word perchance be jumping the next word that occurs is thumping suppose me acting now and dressed and thumping this way on my breast and while i am the audience treating alternately the words repeating thumping and jumping and thumping jumping and thumping and jumping thumping and jumping and thumping jumping and thumping and jumping there sir dont you think it pretty  poet i do not think it very witty  musician what have we to do with wit let but the words the music fit the audience never care a jot whether the verse is good or not then pray you sir dont talk of wit the people will but laugh at it  poet so i would have em by the by  musician oh i had rather see em cry to have some soft and melting strain first raise the heart then down again to keep the the soul in constant flutter then flounce it   poet in some ditch or gutter  musician methinks youre fond of jokeing grown  poet nay sir i think the jokes your own talking of hearts and souls and music enough to make a turk or jew sick and therefore sir i plainly see your muse and mine will never agree i never can yield to your pretense that sounds can fill the place of sense  the happy husband a song where the gentle spring was flowing whilst the primrose pale was growing every morn i told my tale to fair padella of the vale and whilst with artless notes i played beneath the friendly noontide shade padella often would join with me in sweetest notes of melody too short the longest day appeared whilst fair padellas voice i heard too long appeared the shortest night when ever the nymph was from my sight but now padella is my bride nor night nor day shall now divide nothing but deaths resistless dart shall force us ever more to part to a friend in the country since to the town you have bid a long adieu to seek retirement and your health renew which nightly revels had too much impaired or when too much of venus you had shared till grave reflection bid you judge between the charms of m  lb  y and the rural green then since to softer scenes your hearts inclined my muse may now a friendly welcome find and you disposed to listen to her strains whilst she in rural notes sings over the plains while fancy leads her over the shepherds lawn at close of evening or at early dawn though edgware feels not auburns dreary fate though chandau lives not near with princely state yet has thy villa left a thousand charms thy wine gives ardor and thy converse warms the fields adjacent yield the endless game cricket etc  though small thy gardens yet they are known to fame a beautiful statue of fame stood in his garden  each grave old cit as he goes jogging by longs for her matchless leg and lilly thigh and from his heart would fain with fate agree to have old joan his wife as cold as she while here you talk a rainy hour away or in the sunshine join in rustic play or when disposed for solitude and talk to have some h  d join your evnings walk no artful gambler ever should open my door in hopes to win another hundred more no by the gods such sharpers would i scorn and let the beggars die as they were born song set to music by mr barthelemon talk not of books of dress of riches talk not of bacchanalian joy for beauty it is that most bewitches all natures governed by a boy at cupids touch even heroes tremble to beauty stoics often submit and nothing clara can resemble that has not beauty love and wit an epistle to a friend i cannot yet say what you will lay by the d  nd mischievous quill i cannot for my soul refuse the invitation of my muse the restless jade will every day throw some strange subject in my way and i as restless as herself cannot throw it wisely on the shelf i cannot pass a villain over or see the sufferings of the poor nor can i at a blockhead wink but out i blunder what i think in hopes to make some reformation amongst the jockies of the nation who trick us some how every day or steal some privilege away  when halfbred critics come to mind the pest of genius and mankind whose pockets seldom hold a groat whose merit lies in finding fault a needy prostituted tribe who damns or praises for a bribe forsaen of genius and the muse fell envy teaches m abuse from foul malignancy of spirit they turn a jealous eye to merit in secret stab her every hour whenever they have it in their power like coward thieves in ambush fight or rush upon you in the night for while they wound unknown unseen they are sure you cannot fight again with these and what i daily meet in the newspapers and the street my muse as muttring in my breast will not let me have a moments rest but flutters struggles pants and pines until the peevish hussy finds i am fired with an inclination to give a vent to every passion i often would pester you with rhyme but greedy care will not give me time for when a thought has come to mind or when i have found the muse as kind as i could wish i have sat me down and rhimes have on the paper grown uninterrupted for a while in a pure unlabored style but often the business of the day drives my willing muse away each infant thought distracted dies and fancy through the window flies the fatal incident it is full six months cried aladin since emina i have seen say was it not a sorry sin to leave my fairy queen say was it not a sorry sin to force me so away and make me plod through thick and thin over hills and far away to make me soldier against my will and go the lud knows where and what is alas more cruel still to force me from my dear it is fourteen days since last i heard or had one single line and she is forsaen me i am afraid but sure the faults not mine we parted at this very style i thought i should have died i took my leave and all the while the lovely creature cried plague on the man be who he will that first the wars began but may he be more plagued still that schemd the militia plan why should they fix on me forsooth who never got drunk and swore there is ralph and hal aye and in truth i could name twenty more there is thomas now as great a rake as ever trod the lea he got with barn at our wake poor sally mapletree our joe got drunk and beat his wife until she scarce could see and yet for all upon my life they needs must fix on me but i will no longer time delay with thinking what is past i am glad i have got so safe away to see my love at last o how my heart with fancy throbs to think we soon shall meet from her the rofe its color robs the hyacinth its sweet i shall be shamd to see her too in this strange soldiers dress but if her heart like mine be true she will not love me the less i will even across the churchyard now and see my emina she lives at foot of yonder brow where yon white lambkins play here stands the church where she and i together often have been and hope once more yet ere i die to go with her again when she some morning by my side o would it were today shall go a maid but turn a bride dressed like the queen of may then luck attend i will even away in this same soldiers trim desire will not let me stay to make myself more prim ah me what names on yonder stone that meets my tortured sight it is eminas it is here is alone  then to the world good night for like the barbedshafted dart it plunges through my breast fast bleeds within my wounded heart but here i will give em rest o cruel fate i cannot bear to look upon her grave strike me to earth nor longer spare a lovedistracted slave alas i feel my blood retire my eyes grow dim apace the fates have heard my last desire well in the grave embrace an epistle to a friend may i not hope your patience will endure the plain wrought offering of a muse obscure say shall it be less welcome cause it came signaturd by one beneath the heed of fame reduced by fortune to an humble state denied by genius ever to be great alas i am lost in thinking what to say till thought kills thought and drives my muse away at length i doze and wander in my dreams hunting new epithets sentiments and themes then pleased i wake but find my treasures flown before my eager hand can set em down how hard to please myself  what shall i do in such a case how please the world and you my fancy breeds apace no mortals more but then the produce proves so very poor twill scarce deserve admittance at your door my days thank fate are well employed at night i spin a rhyme or two by candlelight to aim at fame is dangerous indeed scores make attempt but very few succeed far be the thought the fatal thought from me for ever let me boast humility to please a few and that same few my friends will be the summit of my hopes  my ends would be fulfilled could i with humblestride tread the smooth plain with h  d by my side let others try the lofty hill to climb soaring scholastic bove the reach of rhyme clad in the vest of sophs regardless stand the praise or censure of the critics hand thirsting for pathos to confound the sense like useless gewgaws shaming the expense o be it mine to speak in natures strain at once to picture and at once explain  no pomp of words could ever enrapture me like purewrote sounds in plain simplicity to trace out natures wild and endless scene her painted valleys and her woodlands green there can i seek for themes when fancy dies walk through the forest and observe the skies nor seek in vain  each day sends something new some newborn beauty rises to my view could i but steal the art of painting here these scenes in verse as they to me appear had i the power with that art to please to paint em well and paint em too with ease could i like you at once ensnare the mind engage the eye and keep the heart confined and do it too with such engaging grace with manly strides the paths of nature trace the muses then should claim each mite of time and every thought i would jingle into rhyme vain hopes alas  but hopes are apt to please and fancied pleasures sometimes give us ease credulity a mild and simple maid too often alas by promises betrayed follows the phantom hope with steps so fast till disappointment kills her at the last never let me be so cursed as to depend upon a promise or to lose a friend nor pin my hopes too closely on the sleeve of old or young i have found em both deceive the silvered poll is apter ever to sin than he who never felt razor on his chin old age breeds craft and near his elbow chair sits folly placed his favorite and heir peace to all such if such can peace enjoy whose shallow promise tends but to destroy their neighbors peace  that wretch i envy not who boasts a name by broken friendship got for ever will i bar my homely door against the greatest knave so meanly poor conscience shall haunt the disingenuous slave and time shall lead him blindfold to his grave i boast no art thence can no credit lose i paint to show my meaning not confuse no rogue to flatter nor no friend abuse the meanest figure claims as great a share of skill to paint it well as the most fair but those the meanest of the mean i call who gain with all my pains no praise at all you that by nature have an heart designed to hear and heal the sufferings of mankind may you never trust the wretch whose friendship tends to no ones good but his own private ends an allegory on friendship what strange migrations happen every day how short alas is friendships golden reign like opening rosebuds drink the dews of may then shortly fall in winters lap again the glowing beam whose lifecreating fire warmed every root and bids the cowslips peep declines its aid and bove the clouds retire and leaves them in their former state to sleep sunday a poem hail holy day by heavenly laws designed a consolation to all human kind to man and brutes a day of peace and rest would man but own his duty and be blessed as when the harp in jesses golden days tuned every sabbath to jehovahs praise by holy prophets and by virgins strung when truth and faith inspired every tongue or when his son with eloquence divine the greatest favorite of the sacred nine made the proud saul whenever he touched his strings bow his stiff neck and own the king of kings observe the present age  how vain how strange how true sang he who told us all things change a puny race of infidels and fools true slaves to vice and fashions gaudy tools strangers to virtue enemies to fame except in foreign dress or foreign name my lord sends forth his hopeful heir to roam to foreign climes to bring new fashions home caught with their manners and their taste he burns and after six years travel he returns a flimsy fop a coxcomb and a fool  a greater dunce than when he left the school quick at intrigue to gamble or to fight a debauchee if not a s  te britain and france with emulation try to outdo each other in absurdity for here at home what vast excess we see in city fops and city quality is there a folly introduced at court but straight on swiftest pinions of report it through the city in a trice is fanned and introduced  sor taste at second hand with cards and routs their sunday is employed and every christian virtue is destroyed mode will bewitch all eyes may plainly see and nothing charms like flimsy gaiety in all degrees at every age we find there is naught like fashon captivates the mind do but observe the rich sir trafficks wife old and deformed upon the verge of life with fulsome art she rolls her faded eyes and thinks to make a conquest ere she dies while in their dress there is no distinction seen tween sixtysix and she of gay sixteen but to my theme my muse at random strays and with a tedious prelude she delays my better meaning and perverts my plan i will paint the scenes from nature if i can we raise subscriptions and new churches build but heaven knows how seldom they are filled should sunday shine a summers day and fair behold what legions round the town repair what flocks to richmond and to windsor drive and buz and sip like drones about a hive at every welcome tavern which they meet affecting bucks and asses prove complete on hackneyd steeds the giddy blockheads fly who kindly drag em home perhaps and die of all the slaves dame natures given us here there is none so noble treated so severe as the kind steed that is ever yet been cursed to have his last load greater than his first then worn with hunger slavery and age finds still a harder journey to engage than when in youth and vigor he would bear my lord a mile or two to take the air but such is fate when useless and grown old to some unfeeling monster he is sold each needy wretch his thirst for taste declares whener he speaks but more by what he wears often is the fancy of some brainless prig couched in the choice of his enormous wig and often we learn the tenor of the fair by the fly glance or belleaffected air is there a nymph oppressed by fortunes frown that beauty might indeed have stamped her own behold her sailing in the pink of taste trumpd up with powder frippery and past resolved against fortune beautys force to try the greatest powers now beneath the sky rather than fate her conquest should impede she will not retreat though virtues sure to bleed behold what droves to bagnigge wells repair crowding together for the sake of air and strictly keeping sundays weekly fair sunk in a vale this fair retreat is placed and with a mountain on each side is graced receiving all the rubbish of the town that has for ages there in loads been thrown smooth through its flat a muddy rivlet streams and down its sides a wholesome churchyard teems here close pent up by thousands we repair and praise the water liquor and the air here lovesick couples every sunday run they marry next and find themselves undone soon shifts the scene the passion next is cloyed and all their promised happiness destroyed behold a pair that but two years ago she a conquette and he a city beau now look with sorrow at their former state and curse the burden of their present fate married they walk indifferent and grave whilst worldly cares their every thought enslave he at a distance from the crowd retires she at a distance leaves her gay desires see selfadmird miss of four feet high display her charms and with an ogle try to captivate some dull unwary spark she often shoots but seldom hits the mark for should the rogue some imperfection spy her crooked legs or bolsterd shape awry if the high shoulder which she would fain conceal some thoughtless turn should cruelly reveal no new device how well soever it is dressed will win the lover to her strutting breast if such a wretch would deal in hymens laws let her throw off her frippery and gaze nor vainly try with selfimagind charms to win the lover to her stunted arms to charm with person never make pretense but try to please with gravity and sense plain be your dressed seem conscious of defect let love subside and try to win respect should some grave friend of sixty seek a wife a needful helpmate at the verge of life who is with your virtues not your person moved is better far by such to be approved than try with such a form to make a prize or hope in vain to charm a lovers eyes who will but rally flatter and despise devote no more your sunday to intrigue nor longer keep your vanity in league for where the person and the mine is awry we seldom find it catch a lovers eye let not white conduit bagnigge or the spaw one sunday more your vain attention draw where swarms of fools of coxcombs bucks and beaux adore themselves and next themselves their clothes where belles repair to catch and to be caught who never yet gave being to a thought you on whom fortune has been pleased to smile lay by your giddy pleasures for awhile regard the cries of nature in distress consine awhile your appetite and dress where fortunes given enough and some to spare let the remainder be the poor mans share an elegy on the death of a friend farewell kind youth my friend farewell since fate will have it so cease cease the solemn passing bell nor rggravate my woe in plaintive notes my muse shall sing thy merits and thy name and on her weak but plaintive wing she will bear thee up to fame what though obscure thou spent thy days a friend to virtues cause thy merits still demand my lays to whisper thy applause the lonely bud that blows obscure beneath the spreading thorn often preserves a scent more pure than what the tops adorn i little thought my dearest friend to see thee dead so soon for who could think the day would end before it well was noon thy noon of life an evening proved thy sun ran quickly down thy morning was by all beloved thine eve without a frown through life with even pace thou steerd without one single foe by friends beloved by truth revered lest envy made them so but who could be a foe to thee a friend to all mankind whose breast was all tranquillity with harmony combined how often have i at peep of dawn thy friendly summons heard and with thee trod the verdant lawn before the sun appeared from richmond hill to twicknam dale how often have we strayed charmed with the thrush and nightingale that sang in dysarts shade when cloudy mists from off the brooks proclaimed a summers day with glee we talked of men and books and argued time away whenever a wild romantic scene has struck our wandering eyes and where the magic circles been great shakespeare would arise where gentle zephyrs blew serene as through the copse we steered or when some garden we have seen great milton has appeared when nature dasyd over the lawn and blossomed every tree the humble thompsons muse would dawn like pure simplicity when over the hill we have chanced to stray and viewed some mansion by often with a smile i have heard thee say its wealthy lord must die thou envydst not the proud his wealth his luxury and pride thy only boon a little health but that the fates denied thy honest ear would never attend the vile detractors lie but with a manly zeal defend both friend and enemy often when the lark had closed her wings the moon began her reign i have heard thee touch thy magic strings and play thy usual strain scarce had the thames sent up a breeze or dews fallen on the ground but through the gentle waving trees i heard the pleasing sound enraptured have i stood alone beneath a cooling shade with extacy i have caught each tone in soft pianos played but now the evening charms no more no more the morn delight since morn nor evening can restore thee back again to sight no more shall i at break of day thy friendly summons hear nor with thee over the woodlands stray before the sun appear in sad remembrance over thy tomb thy requiem will i sing when night with dull and awful gloom shall spread her raven wing the banks of chelmer though windsor boasts her tyrants and her kings her shady groves her forest and her springs her lofty temples and her costly gems her murmuring loddon and her silver thames admit my muse so tread in humbler lays and sing though lowly in fair chelmers praise what though thy banks by kings were never trod no stately savage graced thee with a nod thou happly scapd the arbitrary frown nor felt the curse of being near a crown once on a time there lived a rural pair the gentle philo and salina fair the sad leander loved not more than he when armed with love he dared the raging sea no storyd fair could ever boast a mind more pure no maid could show an heart more kind than she her tresses played about her waist in flowing curls her head with posies graced like the fair lilly essencd every gale while over the lawn she tript or through the dale on chelmers banks the gentle pair first trod ere this fair land felt vile oppressions rod in golden times when love over interest stood and statesmen fought their king and countrys good he tended flocks while she the diffaff played upon the brow or near some friendly shade long had their breasts felt cupids gentle flame and stifled love with common friendships name till bursting forth the blaze dispelled the smoke and philo first to his salina spoke  we have long my fair salina trod these plains in summers heat and winters drenching rains we often steal the honey from the bees and often we pluck the blossom from the trees their tempting sweetness urge us to the deed but yet we find em cloy us as we feed there grows one flower yet that i revere survives in bloom throughout the killing year whose tempting blush and neverfading smell by far all blossoms of the spring excel whose damask leaves distill a balmy dew that breeds desire and maintains it too i often behold it as i tread the mead and every day my longing eyes i feed with fond desire till at last i pine sigh to myself and wish the blossom mine still must i pine still must i sigh in vain it is you must ease my hopes and cure my pain within your reach it hangs within your breast to make me wretched or to make me blessed nay cease to grieve the fair salina cried have you ever asked me ought that i denied sure you have found me selfish and unkind to think i bear about so poor a mind did you a lambkin or an heifer choose you never knew me such a boon refuse then bring me philo where this wonder grows be it a lilly hyacinth or rose be it the fairest bud that ever sprung the sweetest bluebell ever fairy rung within my reach or in my power to give if philo ask it philo shall receive thanks lovely maid  but o you will change your mind when you this fair this blooming beauty find nay doubt me not nor yet my truth decry let not my word upon suspicion die let not your thoughts be timid and unkind till i have my promise and my truth declined no tempting sweet no rose that ever sprung shall make me faulter in my heart or tongue never let me tread these fertile banks again nor walk with philo over the verdant plain when i forget the promise i have made banish salina to some distant shade nay lovely maid be ever ever near should you should fair salina disappear these lonely plains would be more lonely still and burs and thistles grow on every hill to yonder brook then let us bend our way and there behold the prodigy of may and there behold my hearts my souls delight my wish by day and all my dreams by night methinks it is strange that one poor simple flower should over an heart like yours obtain such power the be it is true and butterfly will rove and sport around with animated love when every flower rising to their sight invites the heart and yields em new delight the sun declines apace let us instant go and try if i will keep my word or no then straight they trip together over the plain and bands of cupids followed in a train to bind two hearts with wreaths that never fade and prove the promise of a tender maid the banks they reach and next the crystal brook in which young philo bid salina look the banks are pleasant and the stream is clear but yet i see no rose or lilly near some cruel swain has stole it ever we came in such a case can i be ought to blame say can you nothing in the stream behold no perfect beauty of celestial mould see you not something like yourself appear the substance of that shadow i revere  thou art the substance thou my boasted bloom it is thou must ease my heart or seal my doom ungenrous swain how could you thus ensnare with studied arts a poor unguarded fair am i the fairest philo ever saw could poor salina such defire draw alas i grieve to think what i have done things end in sorrow that are rash begun let me recall it sure i was asleep must i indeed my artless promise keep must i perforce then give myself away to be the idol of a single day to be forgot if philo ever should see some other maid still fairer yet than me but o remember should you ever find some other maid more fair more true more kind forget not then who once you deemed a prize nor make your captive fair a sacrifice o never never talk not so again such fancied ills will rive my heart in twain  here do i vow and when i prove unkind teem down ye clouds and unloose the wind let forked lightning through my cottage shoot and thunder tear whole forests by the root let every lamb that in my pastures stray by turgid floods be caught and washed away let me be sunk in famine and despair beneath the horror of the warring air nay gentle swain my heart would bleed to see thee made the spectacle of misery should thou prove kind and keep thy passion true i wond not wish a fairer swain than you when i prove false  but that can never be my health my life my every hopes in thee if this fond heart should ever a traitor prove and violate the sacred laws of love let shame be painted on my guilty breast and sorrow hunt me from the bed of rest what shall i say  for o i cannot feign what i am not were i the world to gain what shall i say to make my fair believe these tears are real cease o cease to grieve here take my hand my heart i would resign but that has fled this many a day to thine my breast forlorn often led me to despair save when methought i felt my philos there o let me clasp it to my panting breast heal my fond heart and give it endless rest ye woods and vales that heard the lovely sound tell it in echoes to the plains around let the sweet woodlark raise his notes divine telling each swain that fair salinas mine the first of may my tale i take from times of old when truth was more esteemed than gold when pride walked threadbare and despised when folks were better exercised than nowadays when broils and strife defiles the story of each life a country villa near a green inhabitants but twice sixteen an honest squire held the hall surrounded by a turfen wall the friend and landlord of em all a neighborhood so well inclined so simple honest and so kind each tried his neighbor to excel in friendship and in doing well as soon as morning dawn appeared or early chanticleer was heard ever the fond herds began to feed or fairies fled the blushing mead the thrifty villagers arose and from the bed of sweet repose they met the labors of the day and cheerful sung the time away at eventide when work was done they all returned at setting sun and met upon the plain  with glee they pipd and danced upon the lee there in a lowly simple state they felt the joys that fly the great no load of conscience galled their breast content and labor gave em rest twas now the rosy morn of may when flora in her best array bedecked each little rising hill with cowslips sweet or daffodil a may pole tall with garlands hung and rows of birds eggs neatly strung was placed upon a verdant green a tribute to the mornings queen each rustic summons forth his fair and round the pole they all repair the squire amongst the rest arose as twas his custom to dispose of various gifts upon that day and gave good ale and cakes away twelve garlands one small hillock graced in simple order each was placed the honest squire now proposed that each by choice should be disposed said every swain had equal right to any garland now in sight and all beneath if ought should be to claim his right and property for each some little prize contained so that the loser something gained though some were greater than the rest each swain now strove to choose the best young ralph a fair and comely swain the very hero of the plain beheld fair alecy on her way no star so bright no nymph so gay her small and easy waist was bound with wreaths most sweet her head was crowned with every flower of the field that floras self to her might yield she on her head a garland bore its equal never was seen before young ralph set off full speed to meet this lovely maid this nymph complete and struck the rest with great surprise to see him claim her for his prize he first bereaved her of her crown and claimed the maiden all his own now every youngster on the plain looked with envy on the swain but all in justice did declare he won the maid  the trick was fair the squire paused and shook his head his hearty smile of humor fled to see his child anothers claim and now he gan himself to blame the swain beheld the good mans eyes with tears he offered back his prize the squire charmed at such a deed cried you deserve her now indeed it glads me much young swain to find thou bear so great so good a mind here take her lad  i murmur not if she is contented with her lot she smiled consent and cheered the drooping swain she gave her hand her meaning to explain the squire saw and blessed the blooming pair and three loud vollies broke the peaceful air a pastoral on the death of mr c churchill and mr r lloyd the latter dying soon after the news of the formers death jonny and robin jonny ah robin have thou heard the news our blithest swain is dead the greatest favorite of the muse is in the churchyard laid  robin thou do not sure my charley mean my true and faithful friend if so alas my woes again will never have an end  jonny i would it were not him indeed i am grieved the news to tell i know thy honest heart will bleed thou lovdst the swain so well  robin ah woe is me what shall i do how ease the pangs i feel thy words have cut my lifestring through more absolute than steel  jonny nay do not go and leave me too to wander here alone to sit beneath the churchyard yew to weep beside thy stone  robin alas kind youth alas i die my eyes begin to fade i soon shall with my charley lie beneath the yewtree shade  jonny ah most distressed and wretched me to live to see this day i will sit beneath some gloomy tree and sigh my soul away  robin nay pray thee live thou worthy swain and hope a better day let not my lambs die on the plain when i am turned to clay  an epistle to a friend i said i would write but did not dream of loosing by the way  my theme i have been this half hour in a pother to think how i should find another for all i would gathered in my head i found alas this morning fled i scratched my head implored the muse but found it all of little use sometimes a thought would strike my pate about the troglodites of state a savage kind of folks you know that lived five hundred years ago much alike in all their ways to those we have in our days but brighteyd caution stopped my hand and gave me then to understand the danger that attends the task should we but try to strip the mask from off some false fairseeming knave who is every thought is to enslave his king and country every hour for every knave is fond of power a little fellow never ought to tell a great one of his fault for very like for all his pains the other may knock out his brains who having little of his own he is anxious for anothers grown i will leave such themes to such ifeck that neither care for head or neck who run full tilt through muck and mire to set themselves and world on fire i hear you say  what cannot you find amongst the race of human kind another subject to engage and live in this abandoned age no worthy character distressed by some purse proud knave depressed no worthy friend fall in your way to elevate your tardy lay why yes i have i own it too memory brings it to my view whenever of friendship i would talk i am sure to meet you in my walk on the death of bonnell thornton esquire see genius hangs her rueful head like pity all in tears and sighing cries my thorntons dead for see his shrine appears wit raised the smile whenever he spoke enforced by manly sense he never urged a single joke that gave the least offense no praise could ever make him vain no foe enforce a frown yet could he feel for others pain as sharp as for his own where will the needy find relief where merit meet a friend that while they tell their tale of grief shall one like him attend though fate has closed thee in the urn thy name shall never die thy matchless wit shall ever burn to endless memory adieu my dearest friend adieu these lines are due from me for every rising hope i view was planted first by thee the fopling and the ewe a fable a fopling dressed in all his tinsilld pride with knot and rapier dangling by his side with foppish gate he trippd along the street and feared each clumsy mortal that he met lest his silk hose might some rude splash receive or filthy sweeper brush his crimson sleeve an ewe hard drove and panting for her life to scape the savage butcher and his knife hopeless and faint she could no farther fly and though all innocent was loath to die the fopling she beheld to him she flew and thought she might be safe if once he drew his sword in pity to her wretched state and at his feet she gan to supplicate take pity sir the ewe in anguish cried o pluck the rapier from your noble side oh let your gracious mercy interpose and stop the bloody purpose of my foes life sir is sweet when i alas am dead my lambs will perish in the frozen mead they yet are young and want a mothers care to shield em from the sharp inclement air the fop enraged to think a brute should meet and interrupt his passage in the street he was too proud the gross affront to brook and with an haughty but unmanly look drew forth his sword and plunged it in her side the hapless victim fell but ere she died in mournful accents she addressed my lord her tears gushed briefly forth at every word if it be your reason that provoked the deed if it be your justice that i guiltless bleed my fellow brutes more mercy would have shown even tigers might had they my story known had they my lambkins heard in yonder plain bleating in hopes to see their dam again helpless and young they will stray the barren moor but never must see their tender mother more ungrateful lord no beast was ever so rude for savages will show some gratitude the coat that makes your lordship now so fine grew on my back was once a coat of mine the tender meal today on which you fed sprang from my womb and for your pleasure bled but i am too bold by far i fear too rude to charge a courtier with ingratitude forgive me sir though bold the truth i say courtiers receive but seldom will repay their hearts ungrateful no compunction feel i sought thy aid but met thy fatal steel queries addressed to a friend our betters seem to make a rout to find the cause of famine out pretend the mystery is too great to tell us why we have no meat nor can our ablest statesmans head find

he is quite mistaen it wonnot do he will not be easy till he hears from you he wants poor me your anger to amuse by trumping up some frivolous excuse i fain would lay it on the acting now but that his

your gracious summons we pursue i will tell you something odd and something new last night when half the world was fast asleep i chanced into a sothouse club to creep where tailors weavers butchers bakers sat disputing high of politics and state here sat a methodist a man of blood who thought no precepts but his own were good there a poor tailor one of vast persuasion a politician fond of innovation a very coward yet he swore he would ight before he would lose one privilege or right he looked all fierceness and he talked most brave and yet he proved himself a fool and slave from morn to night he sat a muddld sot bound like a vassal to his score and pot his heart often gave his fruitless tongue the lie for he loved liquor more than liberty anon a vehement debate arose and then i whipped across his burning nose sometimes i would tickle him i love to teaze and then to clear his head would make him sneeze when next our shakespeare on the carpet came though all were strangers to his worth and fame the puritan declared he could not see what could be meant by shakespeares jubilee he thought it impious  avarice betide him he could not bear to see ought go beside him mankind were too profuse but hell should stint em they would better bring their mite to doctor squintum i saw their minds were dark and out of spite i was resolved to leave them without light i broke their pipes and blew their candles out and left them making such a horrid rout swearing and jolting one block against another each blockhead felled his loggerheaded brother i laughed until my sides were fit to

peculiar to pretty women how can you say i am pretty celinda is ugly pretends often to know it but she thinks that she is handsome and often will show it if you tell her she is handsome she will say how you flatter she would wish to be taller and fairer and fatter but should you still further in converse proceed and talk of a nymph that is handsome indeed she will soon show her mind which you plainly may see she thinks there is no creature so handsome as she the old women weatherwise an interlude dramatis personae cramp twitch rheum the old women weatherwise enter twitch and cramp twitch

there i rather think it will be fair for by the burning in my toe and by this corn of mine  oh  oh  good lack a day it makes me sweat  oh the burning and the heat besides my cat so whiskd about up

racket and a squalling just like italian catawawling  twitch pray tell me goody how is that  cramp why dont i tell you  like a cat i will tell you how at least i will try  a longleggd fellow six foot

you smile for it is the true italian style and i will try to squal it you just as the male italians do song poor puss was once at frisky play upon a high and windy day she wiskd up stairs then round the floor and then she would hurry out of the door the wind blew to the door at last and caught her by the tail so fast she screamd she squalld she scratched she bawled she spit she swore and gan to rail but with her fury lest her tail god send a change then very soon and if we judge it by the moon the new one which appeared last night lay on her back and shone so bright that i assure you on my word she looked as sharp as any sword  twitch what says old sodo  he has learning and has beside a quick discerning he soon could tell should he but look into his fortunetelling book  cramp i saw him scarce three nights ago but then he terrified me so i could not rest all night in bed his story ran so in my head sometimes he called the moon a punk and said that neptune made her drunk and that she tippld greedily upon the springtides of the sea  one night this great foreteller said the moon was getting into bed and in her reelings had the lot to break her crystal chamber pot that he attributes one great reason why we have had so wet a season  twitch nay i myself have seen her rise with sanguine nose and bloodshot eyes sometimes indeed i have seen her shroud her head in shame behind a cloud  say what is the reason   cramp why i think as sodo says the moon must drink  twitch if that indeed should be the case i think she is wise to hide her face song all things in nature nay all kind of people are apt oftentimes to thirst and to tipple the finick and frible you always will see sit over their coffee catlap or tea and the clown will regale over his noggin of ale pray then why should not we since we find it agree regale on a dram that at once will expel the spleen and the cholic whenever they rebel  cramp once i remember it was told when i was scarcely nine years old the earth had been all flooded over for six and thirty days and more twas the opinion of the wise who knew the motion of the skies the moon had turned her turvytopsy and drank herself into a dropsy the reasons given were most various some said the archer sagittarius as he one night was passing by he let a bearded arrow fly and to this day some folks will tell ye he hit the moon plump in the belly which tapping her for five weeks ater she teemed upon the earth her water others gave it out it was her grief and that suits most with my belief for now too plainly it appears she means to drown us with her tears  twitch but here comes neighbor rheum i vow who wears a very thoughtful brow i wonder where my ladys been she shakes her head what can she mean  enter rheum rheum goodies i am glad to see ye

sky  well may you wonder it is no lie i had not well overcome the shock but straight i heard of portsmouth dock alluding to its lately been set on fire   twitch indeed indeed we have cause to fear when comets and such things appear they are seldom seen but at a season big with civil strife and treason that season i am afraid is come which soon will put a final doom to poor old englands happiness and leave us beggared in distress  cramp before that time it does infer therell be a bustle and a stir harsh words will pass and high debate between the multitude and state  rheum few nights ago like jonny bunyan after eating of an onion nature chanced as twere to steep my senses in lethargic sleep i dreamed the sun had got a spot  twitch oh that is another powder plot  rteum but yet i

goodies a noggin come let us have a noggin to cheer up the heart give me a good cordial for we must be jogging let us toss off a bumper before we depart exeunt singing n b at the conclusion of every song they amble the hays together to the tune they have sung  to a friend who seemed to have a pleasure of conserring his favors on the author but a greater in telling him of them i wrote a letter long ago but did not like it you must know so rather chose to take my time and write my own defense in rhyme though not in your becrabbed style to spatter threaten and revile nor with a cruel aggravation remind you of each obligation though fortune may the devil have her never gave it me to do a favor never dropped an ingot at my door but kept me ever ever poor what matters then all inclination it is the deed gets reputation the heart the will are both as naught the poor must always be in fault and if when wronged he makes defense each word is construed insolence his obligations may enslave him but all his truth can never save him two at a time was it not hard received two letters at once  lashing away at one poor bard in whipcord rhimes enough to flea a puny thinskinnd scribe like me however i rest with this content i am of your charges innocent and should your friendship me forsake i will one observation make where fortune smiles not friendships weak the slightest fault the chain will break in doing good we soon are tired except by interest we are hired lest to some gain our labors point friendship is soon put out of joint it is in nature not in you and with us from the cradle grew i do not say that youre to blame for i myself might prove the same had i as you did every day thrown some advantage in your way i might have sickend at the thought to be too kind may be a fault by some i am flattered some caressed i stand a tiptoe with the best to say i want would not be true i eat and drink as well as you and have by far a greater share of wholesome ale and wholesome air wines of the best each day i drink i cannot be badly off i think although your lines were harsh and rude you never shall say ingratitude inherits any part of me till i have lost my memory i know you feared nor sun nor shower to do what service in your power it would be worldly base unkind to shut such actions from my mind though poor i find that every day throws some new friend into my way and though they wish and treat me well they never shall make my heart rebel against a m  s or a r  e for all the gewgaws of the globe then let not mere conjecture breed her airy crimes it is hard indeed beneath imagined ills to groan which fancys fertile hand has sown for in good faith i should not choose so old and rough a friend to loose however tenacious i may be rebukes appear less harm in thee because i know thy only aim was to have handed me to fame enough of this i hope an answer without abuse too if you can sir on receiving some complimentary verses from a lady alethea with my muse i send happy to have so fair a friend and since you say you like my rhyme i am glad the day will give me time to jingle out my numbers rude from duty and from gratitude happy my b  t  ll here to tell i like my correspondence well thy taste for clio and for letters will set thee far above thy betters or those the world our betters call whose fortune is their boasted all whose fortunes do at once control the dearest passions of the soul but those who have nothing else to boast are lucky blockheads at the most for ever to their wealth a slave and creep unheeded to the grave no friend behind they leave to tell they ever thought or acted well or that they one good day enjoyed in manly sentiment employed are we not then far richer say who seldom pass a single day without a social friendly hour when sprightly fancy often will tower above the reach of vulgar bliss and reason into happiness employ that reason we have given from fertile nature and from heaven then let us b  t  ll
