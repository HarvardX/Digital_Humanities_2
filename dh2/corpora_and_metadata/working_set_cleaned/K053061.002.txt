mdcclxxvii  charles and charlotte letter lxv charles to charlotte dr melbank acquaints me you have hurt your wrist and that it gives you great pain i feel a sincere affliction upon two accounts arising from this accident first because it occasions uneasiness to you and secondly because it prevents your making use of the pen however i charge you not to venture too soon to exert it rather let me be two or three days without your agreeable favors than with them at the cost of your inconvenience i will endeavor to support the loss of your correspondence in the hope that your health may be the sooner restored and as i myself get better every hour i will do my best to entertain you with a double portion of packets  am i not grown a great philosopher do i not at last acquiesce in your own system do i not obey your inhibitions with even a scrupulous ceremony and am i not a mere correspondent am i not the cold creature you wish me  yes charlotte i will yield to your punctilious principles i will not murmur nor will attempt again to invade your repose by desiring a personal interview till the way to it is smoothed by providence that this will be the case i am certain in the mean time i will endeavor to be contented with this remote yet endearing intercourse though melbank has been laboring to persuade me it would be more for the health of my mind and body that i dropped the pleasures of the pen of this he can never convince me though i have received from him the tenderest treatment and find him to be an able surgeon and an amiable man  i this morning had a penny post letter from him which that i may do him justice and give your gentle heart satisfaction i enclose  adieu charles  letter lxvi dr melbank to charles enclosed in the above what a pity it is that many of those articles of conduct which are merely points of equity should in the opinion of the greater part of the world be considered as obligations happy however it is for the tranquillity of delicate minds when the balance of favors between man and man is even because then no irksome sensation of superiority remains to distress either and the interchange is honorable exact and mutual this sir is the state of the case between you and i i am almost ready to confess myself indebted to the accident that brought us together the wounds in which i have been an happy instrument of cure have been the means of making known to me a man of eminent abilities and excellent qualities in the midst of torture and cross circumstances how have i been entertained by his remarks above all other parts of his character i admire the liberality of his sentiments at least they are to be admired in the theory how shall i rejoice to find them equal in the practice to slide again into the first person and speak plainly have you my dear sir generosity enough to receive the enclosed and to use it till i may have occasion to redemand it and will you do me the justice to believe i have had so much move pleasure than trouble in visiting you that unless you are so good as to set down my attention to the score of friendship i shall be compelled to think myself too heavily indebted and so despair of your intimacy though i propose seeing you in the course of the day yet this is a subject i hate to talk of and therefore i have sent yon a post letter that the foolish blush of confusion may be spared to both of us and therefore i beg we may not mention this trifling point when we meet your attention to this request will very particularly oblige  e melbank  letter lxvii charles to charlotte mr templeton has transmitted to me a little rural poem written by a literary friend of his there is a novelty in the story and a simplicity in the sentiment that particularly recommends it to persons of feeling for this reason i am going to transcribe it for your perusal  i am always happier while i am employed either in thinking of you or in any degree contributing to your entertainment were it not for bending my mind assiduously to these little epistolary engagements and by these means soothing my hopes and lulling my cares i should not i fear be able to keep my promise or withstand the impulses of my heart which would carry me perforce into the apartment of charlotte i hope by tomorrow you will be able to take up the pen and give me your opinion of the poem a single line from your own hand will agreeably convince me that you have again recovered the perfect use of it mr melbank is still anxious to have me suspend our correspondence if he persists in this advice i shall hate him in spite of his generosity he is a great admirer of yours  charles silvana the highland shepherdess twas in decembers drear and darksome days when the cold north sends forth his cutting blast twas when portentous clouds denoting storm their sable horrors rolled around the heavens twas when by force of hurricanoes vast the towering fir even to his root was riven till all of feather or of fleece forsook the highland hill to shelter in the vale then twas that poor silvana to her grief a prey and reckless of the raving sky sat on the perilous ridge of the rude rock that frowns upon the dizzy precipice lonely she sat and never did sorrow seize a form more delicate a soul more kind care from her tender cheek now woeful wan the rose had torn and in its stead the tear like dewdrops on the lily settled there five fleecy friends were to silvana dear and more than five moons wasted had they fed on the scant relics of silvanas store the prickly furze the weedentangled grass the thistly blade the heavy hemlocks eaf the bitter mallow and the flowery fern her sheep never cropped but herbs of sweeter taste the vernal pasturage of voluptuous meads the richest grazings of the daintiest dell the velvet verdure of the violet vale the honied clover and the fragrant blade her daily journey to the fertile farms was for the purchase of the days repast but now her eye was fixed her bosom bare irregularly throbbing with its woe wild to the pitiless winds her scattered locks luxurious floated half her shoulder spread and half in deep disorder streamed in air uplift to heaven her snowy arms were raised in passion or in prayer at last a sigh heaved from her hapless heart and thus she sung i twill soon be over  no more despair silvanas eyes shall soon be dry man feeble man was born to bear to look about him and to die ii then soft awhile and gentle death silvanas passing bell shall toll her sheep shall catch her wandering breath and heaven shall watch the flying soul iii this fluttering spirit shall be free my sheep meantime demand my care they browze and bound round yonder tree but ah  their shepherd is not there iv yet cease awhile  i will not despair i see my shepherd in the sky though mans frail race were born to bear the wedded soul shall never die   letter lxviii dr melbank to charlotte i feel myself to blame i have interdicted a correspondence that gives both you and charles pleasure and i am much afraid the health of my patient was not the only motive that led me to this the real motive i dare not discover be it some atonement that i acquaint you charless health is not likely to be hurt or his cure retarded by the letters of charlotte i am in a very awkward situation and beg to be excused for dropping the subject  e melbank  letter lxix from the same to hamlet templeton esquire what must i do mr templeton i am under an embarrassment from the pains of which i can by no means disengage myself will you who are in some degree a party concerned give me your advice to cut short the idle formalities of ceremonious introduction i must open to you the nature of my dilemma at once would you believe it mr templeton while i have been attempting to cure charles i have been myself wounded by charlotte yes sir widower as i am again am i caught in the nets of beauty and merit and am vainly trying every possible effort to forget the form that undid my repose i have already been led into meannesses by this clandestine passion it has urged me to desire charlotte to forbear writing under pretense of its interfering with my endeavors to restore charless health i have visited this lovely woman several times and have had the mortification to hear her heave a thousand sighs and to see her shed a thousand tears although she still remains sixth in her resolution of never again uniting herself to him i have not had the courage to hint at my partiality and to tell you the truth sir i am witheld from such declarations from various motives i have conceived a tender esteem for charles and i am unwilling to give him pain i consider myself as standing in a very delicate light and i know not how i can reconcile the different characters of a surgeon a friend and a lover i fairly confess to you i never saw any woman so formed to please as charlotte as to her having been connected with another were not that other charles i should make that no objection to offer her at once my heart hand and fortune my profession is merely an object of my choice not of necessity and i have an income that could support the woman of my affections affluently were it not for the appearance of duplicity which i cannot bear i should certainly make such overtures to charlotte as might put both my love and my principles out of dispute such a woman sir would grace the arms and bless the heart of a monarch and i should rejoice to lead her by the hand into the embraces of all my family and all my friends  at the same time what can i do would not such advances coming thus suddenly from me look like taking advantages of sickness and separation charless tenderness is too palpable charlottes love is by no means worn off i see them both every day and i every day find in both fresh excellencies which it would be inhuman to injure who knows what may happen cleora may die many events may under the direction of an indulgent god auspiciously concur to bring charles and charlotte once more into the arms of each other i may be looked upon as an usurper as a supplanter of affection and what makes the matter still worse is that i have very lately done myself the pleasure of accommodating charles with what the world considers an important favor i have lent him money it is therefore the worst time in the world to make proposals the poor lads nerves too are at present all on the tremble his strength is but just returning his heart is greatly agitated he cannot get out of his chamber  what can be done mr templeton as a friend to all parties tell me  i am truly wretched myself and yet i should be ashamed if i wanted fortitude to prevent the wretchedness of others particularly those whom i have had the honor to oblige  i am your obedient servant e melbank  letter lxx hamlet templeton esquire to dr melbank your letter brought one of the greatest surprises i ever felt since i came into the world nor can i possibly give my sentiments upon a point so particularly delicate for aught i see you are all to be pitied and you all deserve and have my unavailing sympathy heaven direct you all into such measures as may ultimately be for the general felicity at present i can only remain anxious and wretched till i hear that the wishes of each are granted and this believe me sir will be the first prayer of my heart  h t  letter lxxi charles to charlotte not a word yet if you were better i should have had a written testimony of it and therefore i have the painful certainty to know you are worse  perhaps charlotte you have deceived me a spraind wrist may be a pretense to conceal an accident infinitely more alarming you may for aught i know be at this moment on the bed of sickness  you may be in the agonies of a sore distemper  you may have broken a limb i have questioned dr melbank who it seems attends you pretty closely on this subject and i do not half like his answers he stammers he offers me a feeble excuse he equivocates and he abruptly goes away blushing because he cannot disguise the truth in the veil of a better apology my imagination represents you in a condition at which my heart achs perhaps you are fainting and i am not by to catch you in my arms you are perhaps sick and i am not present to administer the cordials of recovery  you are weeping and i am too distant to kiss away the tear  the point is plain and this is the truth of the whole matter if you do not with your own hand answer this hasty letter which i dispatch by a porter i shall draw the natural conclusions  i shall judge the horrors of your situation and weak as i am venture abroad to offer my assistance  charles  letter lxxii charlotte to charles it is with a sincere pleasure i find myself again able to address my valuable correspondent and i use this first moment of resuming the pen to thank him for his letters and the poem all which i read with great satisfaction it is very true that i have been some time in your debt but you wall now receive a receipt in full for this epistle will certainly compensate for all that is due and make the balances even since the correspondence on my side has been necessarily suspended dr melbank has favored me with a friendly call or two and in his last visit finding me much dispirited he entertained me by reciting the principal passages in his own life i was saying how hard it was to lose a friend at the time one is most thoroughly sensible of his merit upon this he sighed  pressed his hand upon his heart and wiping a tear from his eyes said it was indeed hard i have experienced it most severely madam said he and notwithstanding my present flow of fortune and fullness of practice i dare say i have undergone more than you would wish an enemy to suffer as you seem to think your own situation deplorable although your friend is still alive if you have half an hour to spare i will run over some scenes that may serve to make you contented with your own state by comparing it with that of others  but on looking a second time at your letter i perceive your messenger is waiting an answer upon which account i must reserve the sketch of our friends history till my next letter  i send this merely to show you the desired hand writing of  charlotte  letter lxxiii charles to charlotte if i were now to die twere now to be most happy the written evidence of your recovery and the manifest marks of health i can trace in your letter are all such circumstances of sincere joy to me that i could suffer without complaining and would at any time pay for your felicity the price of my own poor melbank he has been these two or three days unusually pensive and i suppose it proceeds from having related past scenes of anxiety i know enough of him to admire his character i have had several fine assurances of his being in possession of a noble heart he shook me by the hand this morning and as he went out of the door he turned his face and discovered a tear if he has had any tender disappointments heaven knows i pity him you have made me sigh for his story  adieu charles  letter lxxiv charlotte to charles my adventures madam said dr melbank shall be related as briefly as the intricacy and variety of them will admit  i was born under all the smiles of fortune having a man of sense and property for my father a woman of beauty and honor for my mother and no other relations whatever alive that were likely to dispute with me the right of succession but alas madam from my first birthday to the seventh year of my age it seemed to be the contrivance of fortune to enrich me for m father engaged in a business that ruined his constitution and estate in the same instant he extended his trade till he became involved in a thousand hopeless calamities  he carried his ambitious schemes of merchandise till he rashly run into all the extravagance of giving credit he trusted to an agent who as is common enough turned out a rascal and being at last obliged to attend vigilantly to his own affairs he embarked for the east where he had considerable dealings to gather in desperate debts to a great amount  there he caught a fever in the passage  lingered for some days  wrote a letter to my mother during his sickness and absolutely died at last a martyr to that ambition which induces a man to give up according to the common phrase  a certainty for an uncertainty true it is that i was his only heir but had there been fifty competitors not one would have long felt the spirit of litigation rising within them for when matters came to be examined the poor mans ambition for becoming the man of business had buried his real estate in the ruins of an imaginary property and all that he left behind him descended into the hands of a merciless crew of creditors who verified at least one passage of scripture by taking care in all such cases that the sins of the father shall be visited on the children  my mother madam loved her husband so much better than her own life that in the phrenzy of affection she was frequently prevented from making a sacrifice to his ashes of that beautiful form on which he had doated time however brought her usual lenitive and the widow began at length to think it her duty to share the poverty and misfortunes that was by this event entailed upon her child her constitution was always delicate and this sore stroke gave additional force to a disorder which was hereditary to the female side of our family she had the asthma in all its violence and in a few months it reduced her to a shadow as this excellent woman had been too affectionate to secure to herself an original marriagesettlement and the claimants were therefore generous enough to allow a few suits of halfworn apparel which properly belonged to her own person and after this it was not easy to find a poorer pair than now exhibited themselves in mrs melbank and her fatherless son  maternal love nevertheless increased in proportion to the necessity there was to exert it for some little time she tried the feelings of those who had been the companions of her prosperity but that soon failing she applied to a resource which may generally be depended on i e provided the application be earnest in a word madam she withdrew from the smiling apologies and civil evasions of friendship to her own industry being educated in all the accomplishments of her sex and particularly skilful at her needle she cheerfully undertook to assist ladies in those very decorations which she was a short time before entitled to wear herself  nay  such was her humility she condescended to manage the work of those very women whom in the lifetime of her late husband she visited upon terms of equality and intimacy but fortune you know madam elevates and degrades sometimes in the same hour  from these efforts i mean out of her work she not only accommodated me with food but instruction paying regularly for my schooling and providing for me every comfort of mind and body  in this manner with very few helps were we subsisted for several years till at length her disorder grew so bad that she was totally unable to proceed in the business  a business madam which want had urged her to undertake as i was deficient neither in gratitude nor filial feelings and was by this time arrived at the age of distinguishing judge the state of my mind at perceiving the dear person to whom i had been so long indebted declining away in silent and wasting agony under my eye her physician recommended change of air and i therefore removed her a few miles distant to a little village contiguous to the thames still madam the cruel distemper gained upon all our endeavors and neither sunshine verdure nor rural breezes could restore her sixteen days did she lay panting in the extremity at the end of which time we had exhausted all the little savings that the exactest economy had hoarded up against a rainy day after the necessary expenses of our subsistence were answered  for my own part bred as i was to no employment and but just raw from school i knew neither the value of talents nor the means of getting money by art or by diligence but our affairs were now come to the crisis my poor mother lay speechless the woman with whom we lodged pitied her extremely and as an instance of it began to tell us how inconvenient it was for folks like she and her husband who had a small house to let lodgings the husband spoke first obliquely and then directly of a cousin that was upon the road to stay with them during the fair time and in the progress of their observations they made very pertinent comments on those excellent places of resource for poor wretches  the public hospitals  assylums said they where those who want diet and doctors and yet have no method to procure either may get both for nothing  in this exigence madam upon the edge of every thing dreadful famine on the one hand and despair on the other i sallied out of the house resolved not to come back with an empty pocket  accordingly in the distraction of my mind and in the simplicity of my head i opened my case to the very first person i saw the first person i saw happened to be such a one as i fear take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again he was on horseback not resident in the town but merely passing through it without scarce knowing what i was about i told him the incoherent story but told it to the heart  and never  no madam  by my soul never shall i forget the anxious air and melting tone with which he said  talk no more poor youth talk no more but quickly lead me to your mother what a tear did he shed on my hand as he dismounted from his horse  o god madam my only surviving parent was breathing her last as we entered she had not strength to speak  she could resist the attacks of her fate but faintly  it was just allowed her to say faulteringly  kiss me my son and even as i was stooping to obey her the lip quivered in death  in the next moment she was an angel  this worthy stranger buried my mother with all the attention and sacred decency due to a parent of his own and for a long time afterward he supplied me with every thing that could sooth the mind or comfort the body but alas this refuge was soon taken from me the gentleman died suddenly and i was once more left upon the wide world an orphan without a friend i was now reduced to seek for subsistence in the capacity of a servant and had the good fortune to be taken in by a nneighbouring apothecary for the menial purpose of carrying out his drugs it was at his house madam that i first saw the exact resemblance of yourself  similar in sense  similar in beauty i shall not however trouble you with the annals of my courtship the apothecary took a particular liking to me and after i had been his servant two years exalted me to the dignity of being his son destitute as i was and gave me his only daughter intending that i should continue with him and learn his business he died however in less than six weeks and continued his partiality by bequeathing to me and his beloved maria  so was my wife called  his whole fortune amounting to near three hundred pounds a year in landed property besides a good house as an honest man i must tell you madam that the apothecary had a nephew which having disobliged him he never had seen for many years and though he was once to have been the chief heir was not so much as mentioned in his last sentiments  of this indeed i did not hear till i had spent the whole fortune for maria had never seen the young man and his uncle never spoke of him to her since i have known the fact i have vainly endeavored to find the youth that i might make him amends but my researches have not been yet rewarded and the apothecarys old friends tell me they believe he is dead  a foolish ambition is i believe hereditary to my family i had no sooner got a competence than i left the country  sold my house there and thinking that my observation had qualified me for the apothecary business i opened in an absurd hurry a shop of my own i laid out a large sum to the worst advantage with a druggist and finding myself without connections i advertised for custom during this period i was surely possessed for contrary to the entreaties of my wife whom i adored even while i contradicted i resolved to go on nay not to have any reserve with you i was so plunged in this medical madness that i purchased all the pompous paraphernalia of the doctor and in the shop of an apothecary had all the tremendous apparatus of a surgeon i give you leave to laugh at me when i tell you that i cropped close to my ears a fine flowing head of hair to surround my lunatic pate by a set of enormous curls rising in formidable exactness tier above tier in all the majesty of a physician i became perfect in the pat on the snuff box the management of the graver muscles and the swing of the cane i knew the several uses of the watch i affected to abridge my latin and to sign the initials of my name as unintelligibly and obliquely as possible and to sum up the whole i should certainly have ventured upon an equipage  that most necessary of all pompous appendages  had not my poor girl with streaming eyes told me what really was but too probable that all those accomplishments would be of no sort of service and that she verily feared neither chariots nor chirurgical instruments nor drugs nor gallipots would be of any consequence till i could prove to the faculty and to my friends that i understood something of the profession beyond its pomps and vanities i began to think there was some truth in my wifes remark for i could neither get any mortal to tell me he was sick nor any man that wished me well who did not tell me that he was sorry one day however fortune was determined to throw a job in my way it happened that a man was thrown from a ladder as he was repairing a house and in his fall broke his leg at the threshold of my door  god forgive me madam but judging it to be a simple fracture i blessed heaven for the accident i first scribbled a prescription in the capacity of a physician then made it as an apothecary and lastly i began to feel the part as a surgeon i began at last to bandage the leg and to bleed the arm but the agitation i was in put me into such a trembling that as i held the lancet unsteadily i rambled from the vein and fairly cut a slice from the brawny part of the arm the patient who was a stout fellow started up enraged and swearing that i knew no more how to bleed a man than his trowel hoppd out of the shop in search of an abler operator  notwithstanding these ignominious testimonies of my ignorance i was obstinate enough to persist till partly by pomp and partly by vanity i exhausted poor marias whole fortune from this time i involved my dear contented girl in the effects of my folly and we were both for a long time the dupes of caprice and the slaves of apology reflection and the remorse attending it threw me upon the bed of sickness and then it was that maria hired a nurse to wait upon me while she made application and wrote circular appeals to the most opulent of her acquaintance she undertook this most irksome of all human engagements unknown to me and it was not till after i got much better in my health that she informed me of her miscarriage though i should have thought it impossible to turn the deaf ear to such a creatures request yet she succeeded as people of both sexes generally do upon the like occasions curious although common were the evasions made use of one had unluckily just parted from all his money  a second had taken an oath that he never would lend a farthing more to his own brother and the reason was he had already suffered by his goodnature  a third was excessively grieved for me  a fourth was excessively grieved for maria  a fifth was excessively glad to see folly extravagance and vanity rewarded in this world  a sixth told my wife that he made it a maxim never to give money but that as one good turn deserved another he was ready to be evenhanded with her and give favor for favor  a seventh said he had a sum to make up  and in short madam every one had an excuse so that poor maria returned convinced that indigence professed is the only state that must find desertion and deafness attend its petitions  by this time i felt my folly in all the bitterness of consciousness and in the midst of all these calamities my wife was far advanced in her pregnancy when she fell down stairs hurried on a premature labor and died in my arms in the evening of the ninth day  i was many times tempted to deeds of impiety and despair and having my affairs in the utmost disorder i went on board a tender and with very little money in my pocket more than would pay my passage and even that obtained by the sale of my drugs  for alas my estate was long since gone  i landed in jamaica  as if fortune was once more resolved to befriend me i was in the very ship with a man of the first eminence as a surgeon and of very considerable property who had been to england to take possession of that property his humanity was equal to his ingenuity my history endeared me to him he offered me his pity and before we had arrived at the island an accident happened that changed that pity into the tenderest friendship  he was one evening walking by moonlight upon the quarter deck when by a sudden swell of the sea it being then a calm he was thrown from his center and fell overboard as our ship was rolling on he was soon at the stern and i who was the only person that saw his misfortune ran to the boatswain alarmed the company and ordered out a boat with all dispatch meantime i threw a large rope from the poop and he had the good luck to swim near enough to reach it  by some means or other the boat was entangled and could not be easily extricated  i drew the gentleman by the rope to the ships side  the calm was now quick dead and little or no swell i brought him within half a yard of the gunnel and then stooping till i was even with the water i dipped in my arms while another man had girt a rope round my middle and by clasping the poor exhausted surgeon in my arms with all my violence the man above fastened the rope to a pully and at the risque of almost cutting me in two for i was resolved not to let go my hold drew us both up together  from henceforward this gentleman and i were as brothers for near five years and a half he in every respect treated me as such i studied with the utmost diligence under his tuition in the art of anatomy  i attended him over all the islands in every case and to every patient and in the end i became a tolerable proficient in the mean time an opportunity of marrying to the utmost advantage offered itself  the idea of maria prevented all such connections never was application more intense nor perhaps better rewarded  and i owed every thing to my friend whose name was williamson had maria lived to see this reverse of fortune what could have been added unto me  at length however dr williamson who had not a relation alive that was known to him died of a fever then epidemical in jamaica  he made his will in my favor and left me every thing he could call his own upon earth except the portrait of a lady that hung round his neck and which in the same condition was buried with him the doctors fortune was large and it has given me affluence but not joy for i had much rather my friend and my wife had lived to share them    here charles the doctor ended and giving a heavy sigh took me kindly by the hand and wished me a good night what a multitude of revolutions crowd into the petty span of human existence  adieu charlotte  letter lxxv h templeton esquire to charles i have a strange piece of news to communicate to my dear charles an old friend of mine has just written to me on a curious subject he has it seems lately seen charlotte and is over head and ears in love with her he has a large fortune and is smitten so smartly that he writes me word he intends to make serious proposals of marriage and only wants me to assure him the connection betwixt you and her is actually dissolved i really believe he is in earnest and he is a man of good sense great connections and splendid circumstances besides being in one of the genteelest professions what the deuce am i to say to him on this point he presses for an answer and i am utterly unprepared for it for your part i suppose you would not give your consent to her being the wife of an emperor and yet if this spark should make honorable advances and offer such terms as are extremely flattering and advantageous how would you act in that case would you oppose or would you promote or would you stand neuter upon the occasion shall i not do right if i tell my friend the subject is too nice to be spoken to  or shall i  but you must direct me i will not send a slip of paper till you give me full instructions and so pray write to me immediately  h t  letter lxxvi charles to charlotte i have resolved to venture into the country for the benefit of the air and therefore you must not expect to hear from me again for some days for a short time therefore adieu to  charles  letter lxxvii dr melbank to charlotte have you seen charles he has left his lodgings and yet has taken nothing with him his landlady informs me he went out with twowelldressd men in a coach although it was evidently very difficult for him to get in the carriage if you have not heard from or seen him i shall be exceedingly uneasy i had written the enclosed letter to you ever since yesterday morning and kept it in my pocket nor do i now send it without being doubtful whether it ought not to be suppressed at all events i beseech you not to break it open or pay it the least attention till you are perfectly satisfied of the safety of charles  e melbank to charlotte being the letter enclosed i feel myself in the greatest confusion as i take up the pen to address you my design however is laudable and my wishes innocent there is a person of my acquaintance who is lately become tenderly sensible of your merit and he is extremely anxious for me to endeavor to interest your sentiments on the subjects at present however he will only dare to trouble you with a single question  could any thing incline you to enter into the marriage state with any other person than charles  in other words  could the utmost assiduity attention and ample fortunes all at your disposal prevail with you to accept the hand and suffer any other object to cultivate your esteem and lead you to the foot of the altar i will take care that your reply to this shall be decisive it shall inspire encouragement or extinguish it for ever  not the passion  at least the declaration of it  i am your obedient servant e melbank     letter lxxviii charlotte to dr melbank i had a billet from my friend charles a few minutes before i received your favor and though i am afraid he ventures out too soon yet i am acquainted with the design of his excursion which is only to get a little fresh air and i suppose he has taken a couple of friends with him to look out a pleasant and wholesome spot after he is fixed we shall certainly hear from him  in relation sir to your enclosure i should esteem myself unworthy the compliment intended me if i did not instantly reply to a point of such consequence sensible as i am sir of the honor  greatly as i venerate the sacred rites to which you allude it is clearly my duty to tell you that i can never conceive myself justified in giving my hand to any person while charles is living there are certain circustances between us which make this resolution a matter of conscience and though it is highly probable i shall never be more than that gentlemans correspondent yet during his life i am solemnly determined never to admit or even think of the addresses of any other man upon earth in my unlucky situation this may sound affectedly but indeed sir it is pure principle and you cannot give me so elegant an instance of your friendship as your interceding instantly with your acquaintance to forbear the revival of a matter that must be unsuccessful  i am your obedient servant charlotte  letter lxxix charles to h t esquire i write this letter to you in a place of confinement to which i was carried just as i was preparing to walk abroad for the first time since my illness the shock has returned upon me a violent fever by some means or other i fainted away in the coach from surprise and weakness and i now find the dressing has left my wound and i am in a great deal of misery this is the more unfortunate as i am resolved not to let either melbank or charlotte know a syllable about my situation i have been already too much obliged by the one and i cannot bear to be for ever racking the generosity of the other how any of my creditors could possibly detect my retreat sequestered as it was and apart from all my former connections i cannot guess evident enough it is i am in prison and for a debt of all others the least recollected because i do not now suffer for myself but for having made myself foolishly answerable for the extravagance of another yet the creditor is a very humane man and some cruel tamperings must have been used with him before he could be brought to this measure to enquire however into these points is absurd i am a most unfortunate man and the hand of adversity is eternally upon me  since i came hither i read your letter upon the subject of charlottes marriage ah mr templeton how does selflove stand armed against the welfare of social but sickness and acute distress has perhaps mended both my heart and my ideas i can now cooly consider myself as i really am a man marked out from community to be eminently miserable a young creature whose own family have long confederated against him even till the wishes which could only be satisfied with his destruction are completed yes dear templeton i now behold myself with an impartial eye  as a triumph to my enemies as an anguish to my friends  as a distress to those who have ever connected themselves with me i blush to examine this picture of the truth and the only atonement i can make is to make a decent retreat from conscious error at once in the first place templeton let me endeavor though very late to do justice to charlotte a friend of yours with all the advantages of birth fortune virtues and a genteel profession will marry her  will lead her by the hand you say and offer her terms of tenderness and honor it is enough templeton i see plainly my duty and i am inspired by the prospect of it fully convinced as you are of the gentlemans merit and circumstances i shall rely upon your judgment and enquire no more  pray present my compliments to him and after you have read and put a wafer under the enclosed letter deliver it to him from  charles to  being the enclosure sir your friend mr templeton has written to me upon a very delicate occasion and made known to me the wishes of your heart ah sir should those wishes be gratified what a happiness will you enjoy i need not i presume point out to you the merits of the object whose affections you design to solicit although it is impossible you should at present be so intimately acquainted with them as i am notwithstanding this sir i have now so full a sense of what ought and what therefore shall be done on my part that you may rest satisfied of meeting no interruption from the writer of this letter he advises you on the contrary to make advances to the heart and hand of the loveliest of women he is convinced how much it is for your felicity and her reputation his own selfish wishes he sacrifices to such considerations and he declares solemnly that the husband of charlotte shall have the veneration of  charles     letter lxxx charles to dr melbank finding myself perfectly stout and my wound free from any pain i have been bold enough to make an excursion into the country just within reach of the pennypost through whose medium i send this and shall send my future letters to you and to charlotte i hope by this time your good sense and good nature have recommended you to that ladys attention i even wish your sentiments may have weight with her because in that case you may be of service in a matter wherein her fortunes are nearly concerned to speak plain dr melbank an opportunity invites which should not be neglected a gentleman of great property and many amiable qualities is struck i find as indeed he well might be with the beautiful form of charlotte his views are noble he is well acquainted with her late connection and yet his ambition is to make her his lawful wife judge how thoroughly i must be convinced of the importance of her inclining to this offer when i can bring myself to desire you will deliver a letter to her upon the subject a letter mr melbank urging her by all the arguments that arise out of the case fully contemplated to accept the hand of another admirer nay more i enjoin you sir as you value the the character of this charming but injured woman to second my eloquence by yours and to suggest every thing that may incline her to a measure so auspicious to her in every respect i send my letter under cover to you and sealed that you may first run your eye over it and see the motives of the now resigned  charles to charlotte enclosed the lessons of charlotte have at length brought charles to a real sense of right and wrong he has deliberated upon his duty several solitary hours and the result of the whole is a plain conviction that his continuing to correspond with her is highly culpable his weakness is constantly urging him to mix with his sentiments the expressions of love all which serve to fan a fire that might otherwise be consumed charles is at last certain that he is doing his fair friend an injury by this conduct he is persuading her to cherish a hopless passion and must consequently make her very unhappy were she left to the drift of her own prudence and wisdom they would soon conquer a fatal flame which is perhaps acquiring fresh force from being thus indirectly cherished she is by these means also kept out of those elegant circles which are so innocent so advantageous and so agreeable to female youth perhaps if she were to go more into the world she might meet the man whom she might yet like  whom she might honor with the name and privileges of a husband the curse that attends charles may not attend another and the advantages of marriage though in real fact they may not in particular cases contribute much to purity of heart contribute infinitely to worldly reputation charles is become sensible of what charlotte ought to do should she receive advances of this honorable nature as it is impossible she should act unkindly to any man so if any man of fortune good temper and good sense should address her it is the most serious advice of charles that she could indulge him with encouragement blinded no longer by the mists of passion he can now see the train of desirable consequences attendant upon such a step he sees the amiable charlotte caressed by those who before had the insolence to sneer  he observes the beautiful martyr embraced by those who lately kept aloof the very virtue and excellence over which affected state and haughty chastity before triumphed is now congratulated complimented and applauded  she will therefore weigh these important articles and whenever they present themselves to her acceptance it is the hope of charles that she will not refuse them that she may be tortured with no more improper sentiments but lay such as these to her heart  is the last intruding prayer of  charles     letter lxxxi h t esquire to dr melbank  sent without a signature in a feigned hand there is a friend of yours in great distress at the  prison he is ill and your assistance as a surgeon would perhaps be desirable  i am your humble servant  letter lxxxii charles to h t esquire read the enclosed and pity  charles cleora to charles enclosed you are not to attribute your present confinement to the malice of the creditor at whose suit you were arrested it was at the instance of mrs p your mother who takes that method of bringing you to a sense of religion and your duty she considers a jail as the school of virtue and apprehends you will now have something more important to employ yourself than in scribbling love letters be assured however sir i had no hand in bringing upon you this trouble and have but just heard it from the mouth of your creditor charlotte has no doubt by this time been to comfort you and with her i suppose you think all situations equal  cleora p s your reversionary annuity is likely to be swallowed up in the expenses of the law suit       letter lxxxiii charles to mrs p madam since the most fortunate circumstance that ever befell you next to the marriage with my father twere necessary to say that i mean his death i have been sitting down many times to write to you sometimes in the ardour of an honest resentment and sometimes as a pleading neglected child but i have remained silent even yet an left you uncontrouled to the luxury of your good success and of my anxieties but your conscience now seems quite brought over to your side and i can no longer suffer you to triumph either in the benefit of my inheritance or in the warm and wicked comforts of a wealthy widowhood  oh what a robe of mourning has yours been madam without trying upon you the force of truth and remonstrance  without exerting one desperate experiment upon a heart which habit and nature seem impregnantly to have fortified as if it were the citadel of cruelty against all the artillery of the parent and of the woman  the artifice and complottings by which my destruction has been effected are not unknown to me  how is it mrs p that you are able to reconcile to yourself at the foreboding age of sixtythree actions of a color so atrocious that the penitence of your youth upwards were scarce sufficient to wipe away by what casuistry have you pacified every private monition and how skilful must have been that sophistry by the magic of which you are capable of sitting composed at the head of a table which you have stolen from your child but why do i interrogate it is a maxim in morality that a bad woman has no limit to her crimes you are gone too far to recede and i have no hope that you will mend in the progression but expect that you must gather guilt as you go onward to the grave till it shall be the pleasure of providence in mercy to me and mankind to confine you there  you accuse me to your acquaintance of wildness and profusion it is the wretched pitiful pretense of guilt of private guilt laboring for a public apology to lay some error to my charge was necessary to save you from the assaults of your sex to palliate a conduct like yours it was indespensible to allege something against me since to have tormented a child in such a manner without some shadow of occasion would have argued a temper too monstrous to have been ranked among women and the very boys would in mere vengeance have stoned the inhuman mother but depend upon it the sick pillow will be to you a pillow of plagues your bed a bed of torture and every feather there will prove a thorn to torment you is this the language of lunacy is it the violence of phrenzy no madam faithful to the injuries of its master this vindictive hand has hitherto confined itself to sentiments of the most frigid moderation from this moment i cut you away from the insulted sensibilities of affection when nature discards you what claim can you have upon the heart of a son and yet do not think i mean to forget you so far as to leave you to yourself believe me madam the day of such voluptuousness is past and although you have robbed me of every right which should at least have divided with you the comforts of the world i will henceforward take care that you shall no more enjoy them without the heaviest tax of indignant reprobation  your argument with my poor father was always in the same style i should spend his fortune with what parental piety have you provided against this but even granting it had been so had i not on my side the claims of nature and of blood and what were your claims madam the claims of a gay needy woman who after having been long setting in vain the matrimonial trap caught in it at last a gentleman of property and by these ingenious measures rose from the indigence of your widowhood to the dignity of a wife and by surviving the second husband  enjoyed widowhood again with all its most favorable perquisites consider your shattered fortunes at the time of your matriculation into my fathers family did you bring sixpence into that family which you have thus iniquitously plundered are you not scorned by the very people whom the maxims of sordid courtesy oblige to receive the hated guest into company nay have not many of these openly discovered their indignation has not your brother the good mr s  often spoke warmly and disdainfully against the cruelties which at once mark and stain the character of sister and of christian has not your usage to the unhappy writer of this letter even in the soft moment of unoffending infancy been the remonstrance of the rich and the proverb of the poor did not your inhumanity grow with my growth and strengthen with my strength till i was three times compelled to find resource from the unkindness of a mother in the wanderings of the world and in getting a meal in whatever part of that world i could obtain it is there a pang a sorrow a disaster or an agony which either your artifice or open malignancy has not inflicted upon me have you not been the topic and the ridicule of the very man  mr w  whom you ordered to exert the tyranny of the rod over me at an age when the birch ought to have been retorted on his own posteriors did not this very man i say point at you from the public pulpit in the the presence of the deity and did not your conscience take alarm till it extorted from you a paltry half crown almost the largest liberality i ever had from you have i not stated facts have i stated more i appeal to an indignant county i appeal to a large attesting congregation was it not also amongst your schemes to ship me away for the torrid terrors of senegal and was not the very captain  a sea captain madam who had passed his life on the rugged bosom of the ocean  too tender to acquiesce in a stratagem at which though a woman projected it the pity of a panther and the bowels of a bear might have revolted  you often say in your conversation that i have lost my character oh hard of heart i have so thanks to my own mother i have not only lost that but my health happiness and patrimony the latter of which you now riot in what a pity that you are in the wane what a pity that there should be one who must soon plunder the plunderer what a pity that death must in a very few years defraud the defrauder these however i know are thoughts you pretend to indulge you are among those magnanimous characters that with roman fortitude can bear pain combat inconvenience and smile at dissolution this kind of stoicism i have heard you boast and it must be confessed you are when in perfect health a notable heroine how well you can support poverty with a full purse how much more independent and stationary you are than your wicked son with a well furnished house and affluent income at command my house madam my fortune but pray enjoy them by the laws of rapine they are yours i can earn the bread of fatigue while yours is already provided by your own impiety provided and much good may such provision do you  you are i find as you ever was seconded by that infamous attorney mr j  and i dare say you have made your story good among such of your friends as live at a distance from the great scene of your stratagems with them you are alas the best but most unfortunate of parents a desolate widowwoman forsooth who equally mourns the loss of her lord and the wanderings of her child oh force of feminine fraud execrable execrable delusion where where madam must i look for a parallel to you not in man surely not in any one of your own sex i hope to heaven for the countess of macclesfield herself whose infamy you know is published was merciful and maternal to you i fear we must quit the bounds of this world in search of the simile and descending into another find your resemblance in the father of finesse it is recorded you know madam of him and of him only that he could for his purposes assume all shapes and characters make the worse appear the better cause and sometimes rose even a minister of light to determine precisely whether he was in reality an angel or a fiend there is however a uniformity in your character not unworthy of you to be complete in crime is at least more ingenious than a halfwitted bungling villainy you are above being content with your mere victory in the court of chancery and as the magistrate did not take care to compel you to preserve my poor pittance in reversion after you are gone to account you seem resolved to delay the sale of the estate and had rather i perceive pay away all the hopes i have in the world in the interest of creditors demands than deposit the annuity in the funds lest it might be possible for your persecution to die with yourself but you are determined i find to be consistent and are therefore taking the only measures which will enable your barbarity to survive the grave  my exhausted paper warns me to quit you for the present and i shall leave you madam to sup with what appetite you may though i am confident your relish to it would be keener were you to know that i have no supper to enjoy in this important particular however i must disappoint you my senses are still sufficient to the purposes of common life even though liberty is taken from me i have frequently heard you wish that i could neither read nor write preresolved as you were to drive me to a dependence on the efforts of writing and reading i see nothing preposterous in the wish i suppose then it would give the total finish to your exultation if it should please the omnipotent to touch the brain the loss of my senses would indeed be joy to you and i know not whether your heart would not open wide enough to purchase for me the bells the whip and strait waistcoat could you at the same time purchase the delirium which would make such dreadful furniture necessary but perhaps this may never be crowded into the catologue of my calamities he who feeds the ravens rewards at least with bread the efforts of an injured child providence will protect those whom the parent has neglected when the thoughtless ostrich leaves her egg under the sand it is rescued from the violence of the wave and is called into being by the sun beam the allusion is striking madam may god give you though late in life a soul to feel it farewell i will write again soon your  charles p s i find i am to enroll among the catalogue of your maternal indulgencies my present confinement in the place from which this letter is dated had not this last stroke of barbarity been added to the rest i had not even now taken up the retaliating pen but i have been too long passive  you triumph in the severity with which i meet the attacks of calamity and you have at length extorted from me a reply    letter lxxxiv mrs p to charles you have written a very long letter to a very short purpose since it only induces me to exhaust a very few sentences upon you in order to show with what a sincerity i despise you let them laugh who win let those who lose rave i have got the estate and see no reason why i should interrupt the composure and luxury it produces by putting myself in a passion  i am the victorious e p  letter lxxxv charles to mrs p i thank you madam for this last blow at my sensibility may it be as effectual as you could possibly wish it and may the hand that has smitten have no future opportunity to be uplifted against the bleeding heart of  charles  letter lxxxvi charlotte to h t esquire oh god of heaven mr templeton what am i to do now all that i felt before was lenity to the misery in which i am at this minute involved poor charles is in a prison without money without health without a friend he has sent a letter to mr melbank and another to me disguising his situation and advising me to accept the hand of some other man whom he s given to understand has addressed me it was from cleora that i learned his calamity and that it is occasioned by the malice and unnatural schemes of the restless mrs p his mother i have not seen dr melbank since i received this killing intelligence and when i do see him there is a certain circumstance which makes it highly improper that i should apply to him of all the men in the world for relief how mr templeton how dreadfully is this excellent youth reduced what a soul must he possess to write such generous letters at a crisis so deplorable perhaps he has had a return of his fever  perhaps  indeed sir i am almost distracted i dare not go to him nor can i stay away from him oh these cruel debts that are pulling perpetually at his heart strings oh sir what step can i possibly take almighty god direct me  charlotte  letter lxxxvii from the same to the same to what accumulated indignities does the want of a fortune expose me soon after i had sealed my last letter to you i hurried on my things and walked out into the park to meditate on the steps i should take in this dilemma i had not gone more than half the length of the place before a gentleman accosted me by my name and enquired into the cause of that uneasiness which was but too apparent in the disorder of my heart i told him the whole story i soon recollected in this gentleman one of the many who caressed charles for his brilliant sense and as he had lately come to ample fortunes i began to hope i had met the person who would assist in the necessary business the debt said i is but an hundred guineas what say you will you condecend to serve a good man whom you admire will you exalt yourself by entering a place of confinement if so go to him conceal from him by what means you heard of his misfortune and may the power that sees the generosity reward it  he pencild down my address in order as he said to acquaint me what he had done took me kindly by the hand and bidding me be more cheerful left me how happy was i to see him walk briskly down the park and when out of sight i was ready to drop upon my knee in gratitude to the god who raised up to my poor charles so able and so amiable a protector  i cheerfully went home where i had not arrived half an hour before a servant in a livery i recollected brought me the following card oh mr templeton why should i be thus insulted yet never tell charles of it if you have the least regard to the most uphappy  charlotte to charlotte you want an hundred guineas to serve your friend i enclose you an hundred and fifty pounds as it may not always be convenient for a lady to pay one way she has luckily for her the choice of paying it another let charles remain where he is at present  compliment me with the use of his pillow for this evening and let the enclosed pay for my lodging with which you may take him out tomorrow i trust to your honor   to  from charlotte without pretending to any virtue i may be allowed at least pride enough to tell you that you are too contemptible a being to be made an object of charless resentment and therefore you have the satisfaction of playing the poltroon with impunity your bribe i reinclose safely sealed up may charless misfortunes never sink him so low as to receive redress from the hand of infamy he is a nobler object in his prison than it is ever possible such a wretch as you should be in a palace  charlotte     letter lxxxviii charlotte to h t esquire i have not yet either heard from or seen dr melbank and the inflexible charles ceases to correspond though personally divided from this worthy man i must even consider myself as his nearest and dearest friend what then must i suffer to see myself unable to do the least service for him in the greatest exigence i have been to five of those men who advertise to lend money on annuities my poor pittance is so strangely bequeathed that i cannot possibly dispose of it i fully know your circumscribed situation i have sent every thing of value i could possibly collect to be pledged and the utmost i can raise is fiftytwo pounds cleora refuses to tell me the name and address of the creditor or else i might perhaps compromise the debt  oh heavens mr templeton i am this moment struck with a thought which may prove propitious i will put it instantly in practice  adieu charlotte  letter lxxxix charlotte to cleora madam money which charles lent is very unexpectedly paid into my hands by the borrower and i enclose a note to the amount of it charless present situation may perhaps be greatly alleviated by so trifling a sum as fifty pounds at least he will be glad to find one of the many people he has obliged turns out grateful but i am persuaded he would receive this supply with double pleasure at the hand of cleora there are certain disguises which are really virtuous upon account of their motives ah that i could prevail upon cleora to pay charles an immediate visit and offer him the fifty pounds as so much raised upon her by the security of her marriage settlement in such a delusion there could be no criminality for he does not yet look for the payment at the same time it might have such an affect upon charless heart that a perfect reconciliation might be the consequence let this be as it will i seal up the sum and leave the method of conveyance to your direction  i am madam your obedient servant charlotte  letter xc charlotte to charles after cleora declined to send the money from motives of not interfering cruel as you are with your concealments i have heard of your misfortune in prosperity charles i could forgive you for deserting me but to drop my correspendence in your distress  how could you be so inhuman  though i flatter myself you are still a lover of justice and if so you will not scruple to receive what accompanies this letter which is at present of no service to me and may be of some to you you will recollect charles that i did not refuse your address on a similar subject and i have therefore a right to expect you will not refuse mine  ah charles do not at such a time reject my friendship  do not despise and cast off my attentions when they ought to be ten times doubled remember what i say to you and farewell  charlotte  letter xci charles to charlotte oh my dear dear friend i am oppressed  i labor  i am bowed to the very earth with with the weight of various obligations  i am almost ready to execrate the destiny that makes it necessary for for me to receive them  had my hardhearted mother permitted my father to follow the feelings which nature generally annexes to the paternal character i had then been able to confer benefits instead of receiving them i might then have sought out merit diffidence and undistinguished virtue from the barren vale of obscurity instead of which i am condemned to be myself the object of benevolence  how madam  how is a soul like mine to support the burden of perpetual favors that they are delicately bestowed is an aggravation i feel them charlotte  i am conscious of them and they enter into my soul  this is the preamble to a transaction of which i ought perhaps to blush i am at liberty  i am free  my debt is wholly discharged  your letter was delivered to me on the outside of the prison door  i was just stepping into the coach that carried me to my old apartemnts  my protector was leaning upon my arm  ah charlotte  such a friend  whom do you think capable of such things to whom is charles indebted for his liberty it is not to be conjectured  know then that he who so lately saved my life by his skill has now saved my freedom by his generosity  let the name of melbank be carried upon the rosy wing of gratitude to the heaven of heavens i fold up his letter upon the subject give it your tears charlotte  give the author of it your adoration  but pity i charge you to pity the insignificance of  charles  letter xcii dr melbanks letter to charles a friend of mine of the tribe of israel has offered to lend you a sum of five hundred pounds upon the reversion he has been with me this morning and upon terms moderate enough for a jew agrees to furnish the money as this kind of brokerage business is generally kept a secret i think you had better not mention it to any unconcerned person by which means the matter may be privately managed and nobody the wiser  adieu e melbank  letter xciii charles to charlotte the matter of raising money on my reversion is all finesse it is all a trick of the unparalelled melbanks who wanted to deceive me into a notion that i was making use of my own property i wish to heaven we could all meet over a dish of tea and that you would both give me an opportunity to prostrate myself in the presence of each other let me deliver your bankbill with my own hand   adieu charles  letter xciv charlotte to charles melbank is too great for the compliment of common language he dines with me tomorrow  are you disengaged  dare you trust your heart  dr melbank says there is no fear  the dinner will be ready at three oclock  charlotte  letter xcv charles to charlotte i am to be trusted  love yields the laurel to gratitude  charles  letter xcvi charlotte to dr melbank i have written the invitation you desired with a trembling hand  he will come  it is within a few hours of the appointment  the clock is now striking twelve every stroke vibrates on my heart  every stroke is more than a second nearer to the time gracious god cleora is this minute passing by my window  she kisses her hand in compliment  i have not the courage to call her up  she goes on  she is out of sight  i will this instant forbid him  he shall not dr melbank  he must not come  i am feelingly persuaded of the consequences and i  must  prevent them  adieu  to the same in continuation i cannot turn the apology to my mind  i have written and blotted and rejected three different cards  i shall be too abrupt  i wish you were with me that my excuses might be delicate  heavens sir it is past one  i will forbid him at once  and yet  dr melbank  as he is so very calm  as he can view me with the moderation of friendship  as we shall talk upon ordinary subjects  methinks  perhaps  i should suppose  oh what shall i do  let me dispatch this letter to you and let your immediate answer direct  charlotte  letter xcvii dr melbank to charlotte i am not very well and yet i will be with you in ten minutes you have nothing to apprehend all will be as it should be  e melbank  letter xcviii charles to charlotte something has happened that prevents me the pleasure of dining with you i am therefore obliged to send that in a letter which i at first designed to deliver personally i expect the favor of a visit from dr melbank in the evening  adieu charles  letter xcix h t esquire to charles received before the above letter was sent after having congratulated you on the recovery of your liberty and on the acquisition of dr m  s friendship i must inform you that you are more obliged to that gentleman than you can at present imagine it is a duty i owe both to him and to you to inform you of what i know concerning the matter dr melbank charles is the very man who applied to me on the subject of charlottes marriage  dr melbank it is who would lay himself and his fortunes at her feet before the altar he it is who can stifle his own passion in pity to yours he it is who can serve the man that stands in the way of his tenderest wishes  now charles  now is your time  are you equal to an exalted action  have you an ambition that scorns to be vanquished  can you really practice the precepts and the sentiments expressed in the letter you desired me to deliver to the gentleman who courted charlotte upon terms of honor if you can do all these great things this is the critical moment this is the golden opportunity  you know what would exalt your character  you know what will sink the scale of obligations disagreeable to the dignity of charless ambition conscious of your virtue i will never speak or write another line on the affair but will leave the noble heart to its natural operations  h t  letter c dr melbank to charles dear charles in compliance with your whim we have dined without you but our tea will want its social flavor and be totally insipid if not inspirited by your company the kettle is boiling with expectation  e melbank  letter ci charles to charlotte why why did you suffer me to see you  why after i had sent an apology did you throw the temptation a second time in my way  i saw you at the teatable  you trembled as i came into the room  what a vermilion covered your face  by what a deathlike paleness was it succeeded  how unlucky was melbanks departure  how fatal the illness that occasioned it  why were we left alone  why after such an absence were we permitted to be in the same chamber together you were cruel enough not to draw away your hand as i took it  your resistance was a more than half invitation  i carried it to the bosom against which the heart was violently beating and you did but faintly frown  the arm that i clasped round your neck brought me within reach of your lips and instead of throwing me away from the pressure you permitted me to kiss them twice had not i at that moment brought templetons letter out of my pocket  what might have been the consequence i bow reverently to the guardian deity that saved us both  charlotte we must meet no more  i give you to the only man in the world that deserves you you say he cannot speak upon the subject  no matter for that  his delicacy should emulate ours every principle that ought to actuate man and woman demands that we should make the sacrifice to his happiness mutually he loves you unboundedly  his honor only can exceed his passion  he has thrown our generosity beyond all distance there is but one way upon earth to get again within sight of him severe i perceive will be the martyrdom on both sides  ah charlotte we have deceived ourselves  our affection is more tenderly animated than it ever was  it was in yesterdays interview more palpable than at any former period  it glowed in our cheeks  it shone in our eyes  it streamed in our tears  it panted in our hearts  what of that  the duty is proportioned to the danger were we ten times dearer  if alas that were possible i am perfectly satisfied we ought to submit who saved the life of charles but melbank who brought him by the hand out of a prison but melbank what does he require in exchange for all this he requires nothing but if circumstances favored he would make charlotte the wife of his heart his hand and his fortune  what benefits would result from that connection all that we ought to desire the felicity of the noblest character of god  an honest man with riches splendour fashion elegance in the train you cannot love him  admit it he cannot expect it at present but still you esteem you venerate you admire his passion preys upon his health  i see it in his sudden paleness  i see it in his counterfeited spirits  i am so abundantly obliged charlotte that i shall die  i shall die with confusion if i am not by some means able to make a return one great opportunity courts me i can yield to him the object of my adoration  i can yield her in the bloom of beauty  in the warmest ardours of my affection yes charlotte i can in this case resign you though i were to expire in the effort god knows how my heart will bear it but charlotte  i will bear it and have even still intrepidity enough to bid you imitate  charles  letter cii from the same to h t esquire were i not fully resolved to do justice to the advice of of your letter i should want the courage to answer it but cost what it will you may depend upon the gratitude of  charles  letter ciii charlotte to charles i am a very wretched woman charles and know not to what fate i am reserved never sure was any one in so intricate an embarrassment upon one condition however i will make the sacrifice you desire even though the loss of my senses should ensue ah my friend what an gonizing trial do you put me to still i repeat it to you if charles will make one great offering to generosity another shall immediately be made by  charlotte  letter civ charles to charlotte sensibly touched as i now am there can be no condition with which i shall not acquiesce to to promote the honor of charlotte and the happiness of mr melbank who manifestly avoids me lest his tenderness for you and friendship for me should betray him into an explanation make your own terms they shall be adopted by  charles  letter cv charlotte to charles give your hand to her who has lawfully a right to it and i will present mine to mr melbank when he solicits it  charlotte  letter cvi charles to charlotte can nothing less than such a circumstance satisfy you however to show you how far i can go to perform what is dictated by conscience i comply  charles  letter cvii charles to cleora supposing all past actions obliviated have you any partiality for  charles  letter cviii cleora to charles i thank you sir more for the hundred pounds you desired dr melbank to pay me than for the offer of your hand which for many delicate reasons is not acceptable to  cleora  letter cix dr melbank to h t esquire yes mr templeton i will go through what i have begun or perish in the attempt  i am not however boaster enough to pretend that my heart is serene oh sir it is torn almost to pieces i feel my affection for charlotte and my admiration for charles increase upon me every hour i have seen them both together in the same room and the struggles they had to conceal their agitation from a third person broke through all disguises  never did i behold such a scene  i could not support it but withdrew and left the lovers to themselves wretched as i am i deplore the misfortune that keeps them asunder and though it may sound like romance i would do much to promote their happiness nay i will do every thing within my power it is in my opinion a base action to divide them  should charlotte even yield to my proposals upon a reapplication of them what would be the consequence i should possess a womans hand without all her heart i should greatly add to the miseries of a man already too much opressed  i cannot bear the thought  i shudder at it mr templeton no sir  let me not take an undue advantage of the calamity that called me into the family  it cannot be  i foresee the horrors it will heap upon two prepossessed hearts  they labor at indifference and they discover attachment  i will avoid both  some would smile at a man on the wrong side of thirty being thus conquered by a tenderness they would pardon only in eighteen but frigid tempers are no proper judges of more soft and pathetic constitutions  that i do love charlotte is alas too fatally true but my affection shall not seduce me into a meanness unworthy of  e melbank  letter cx charles to dr melbank very long and very anxiously have i waited for you i want to consult you upon a point not to be trusted to paper or the post  but what will i know weigh more with you than all the rest i want to lay myself under another obligation to you  charles  letter cxi the same to the same i am sorry to inform you dear dr melbank the wound in my breast is broke out again and demands your immediate assistance  charles  letter cxii dr melbank to charles too generous too amiable charles how could you invent a stratagem that you knew i could not suspect or resist yielding to in order to betray me into the interview i had with so cautious an officiousness avoided twas a virtue that verged upon barbarity every one of your arguments however convince me that i ought not to proceed  charlotte you say will make me happy  she will conciliate the general joy by submitting to my wishes how charles can that be called a general joy which would produce general infelicity  she would submit  it may be so  the more angel she  but who could under such circumstances be base enough to suffer the submission it can never be i see my duty and cannot suffer even the most eloquent passion  not the persuasive allsubduing voice of love  to lead me from it  i will give my young man proper instructions as to your wound  and am yours e melbank  letter cxiii charlotte to charles how much am i restored to my serenity by the receipt of a letter which i enclose from the nobleminded dr melbank with regard to cleoras refusal of your hand i have only to observe that i have done my duty and you have done yours let that my dear friend be a great satisfaction to us both the worst is past dr melbank is satisfied  cleora is supplied with money  charles is at liberty and charlotte will soon acquire sufficient serenity to write to him  but you shall no longer be detained from the letter which has put me in spirits   charlotte  letter cxiv dr melbank to charlotte enclosed to charles if you can forgive me for having tried by a splendid proposal to wean you from the affection you bear and ever ought to bear to charles i may still expect your friendship though i tell you that i would not now marry you for the uniting indies you have given my heart some pangs and i have richly deserved them for i should have held sacred the friendship betwixt you and charles  in my more serious opinion formed as it now is on deliberation i think you should not go to the altar with a monarch the scenes which i find you have both been engaged in must have established a tenderness not to be conquered if fortune ever favors you will sanctify your mutual passion by a public testimony if it should not i can scarce think either of you at liberty conscientiously speaking to enter into other engagements i am leaving london for some weeks but at my return i shall certainly enquire after the amiable correspondents mean time  i am your most obedient servant e melbank  letter cxv charles to charlotte melbank is like one of those glorious phoenomena which awes us weaker and more imperfect mortals into silence he reaches the resolution of charlotte and throws out of sight the fortitude and dignity of charles as the poet therefore says of the deity i say of dr melbank i lose myself in him come then expressive silence muse his praise   he is too great to talk about let us content ourselves with thinking of him  i find charlotte we must not indulge ourselves in any more interviews  they are treacherous  they betray us let us endeavor to be contented with our usual pleasures of corresponding let us follow strictly the advice of our friend i am weak enough to confess to you that i am more rejoiced at dr m  s noble conquest over himself than at any thing i ever felt since my existence had he married you  had he doubled my obstacles  had he taken you for ever from me  or had the cruel certainty of your being wife to another attended me  god knows how i should have supported it  all his generosity  even though he had thrown his whole fortune into my lap  would have shrunk before me and such is the inconsistence of a tender heart  although i was myself the proposer and promoter of the union had it been carried into execution i believe i should have hated him and hanged myself but as it is i could build churches and erect monuments to his memory he has saved me from desperation he has made me able to bear charlottes absence while i know that she is not connected with another i can bear to live without her society i am happy to hear constantly that she is well that she attends to her intellectual improvements  that she will often read my letters and employ herself in the innocent task of writing answers all these things were i own very lately considered as too little  but adversity brings us to a proper sense of rational blessings and the prospect of everlastingly losing the tenderness of charlotte has made me satisfied with that which at present ought to satisfy me my situation indeed appears upon reflection to be much more supportable than i at first imagined how much severer might it have been rendered by either your marriage or your death let me endeavor to procure comfort from comparison we are both happier than thousands  i have at this minute an instance in my eye to justify this and as i am sure it will serve to make us both more reconciled i will in my next letter communicate it to you  adieu charles  letter cxvi from the same to the same while i was at the house of the sheriffs officer charlotte an adventure struck me so forcibly that it would be barbarous to refuse to so tender a heart as yours the recital of it especially as it will show you that there are agonies in life compared to which ours are transient and trifling in mourning our own calamities and disappointments let us not too selfishly forget the calamity of others but where as in the following case we see wretchedness exceeding our own let us remember that not to be the most miserable is at least one source of contentment and instead of murmuring we ought to sympathize  soon after i was arrested by mr trap and conveyed to his house i beheld a young man sitting in a very pensive posture resting his cheek upon one hand and holding a pen in the other he was not at all disconcerted at my being brought in but smothered the sighs as well as he was able and began to write there is more stuff in the office master said a fellow that now entered the room  there is two or three more of the roe and do family come to visit you  it is a sad thing to be sure but howsomdever you shall not go over the water tonight you are every inch a gemmun i will say that and you spend your money like a prince no no god forbid i should carry any gemmun out of my house while he behaves as such so sit still for you shall not go to jail till tomorrow  upon this charlotte the poor young man looked up discovered his eyes swimming in tears drew a handkerchief out of his pocket and put it over his face  having a little recovered himself he took up the pen again and just as he was applying it to the paper his features assumed something of consolation but this again was presently dashed by the appearance of the bailiffs wife although to do her justice she was a very obliging woman  there are some messages you know so displeasing in their own nature or at least rendered so by the peculiar circumstances which introduce them that they would seem disgusting though they were to be delivered by the lips of the graces  mrs trap therefore was as gracious as it is possible for any one to be who presents a bill that requires to be discharged on the spot her harangue was to the following effect  she was very sorry to trouble him but it was a rule it made all things on all sides easy  scores were scores short reckonings made long friendships  gentlemen were here today and gone tomorrow and therefore she hoped he would not be offended at the customs of the house  here charlotte the prisoner took his hand from his pocket from whence flew one solitary guinea and he protested to god that if the fiftieth part of that sum more would purchase him a passport to paradise he could not raise it  i was soon after this declaration left alone with my fellow prisoner who still preserving an air of dejection addressed me as you will find it recited in my next letter  adieu charles  letter cxvii from the same to the same why should you despair sir said i because replied mr reynolds my condition is on all sides desperate besides that i have no money i have no friends to procure it nor any means or health to acquire it by you sir are no doubt brought here by some misfortune but god forbid you should match in misery the most unhappy man that is now speaking  poor as i was charlotte and destitute both of fortune and happiness i put my hand into my purse which being perceived by reynolds he waved his hand in token of disapprobation and with swimming eyes exclaimed pray take your hand from your purse sir  i beseech you to take it away  i am resigned  i bow me to the burden of my fortunes  money cannot you know sir medicine to a mind diseased  not the fortune of the east collected could restore me to my tranquillity  i beg mr reynolds said i that we may pass the remainder of our evening together without interruption as we are united by a similar misfortune let us make it a social one my fate like yours is not to be alleviated by money yet let us for this one night live in the hope that the morning may bring comfort on her wings  you are very polite and propose what would be extremely agreeable sir said mr reynolds  but really  really  i  i  i   here charlotte he began to reexamine and shake his pockets  oh fie fie sir said i  i went out and ordered agreeble to the slender state of my finances and with a prudent recollection of the charges of the house a comfortable supper at my return poor mr reynolds was weeping over a letter that by the evidence of several places much worn and a variety of foldings appeared to have been the frequent subject of dear and solitary meditation after he had read it he pressed it to his heart and kissed it he looked steadily at me and thinking the sentiments would speak best for themselves put it into my hand without uttering a syllable  as i know my lovely correspondent charlotte does not possess a heart like that invulnerable piece of rock which lies putrefying in the bosom of mr timothy trap as i know on the contrary she can pity the sorrows that even surpass her own i will oblige her with a transcript of of the contents of the letter which the prisoner trusted to my perusal  the enclosed letter written on a deathbed most dear james i want the spirit to write what i have not the strength to speak as i have persuaded you to leave my bedside for a short time i will employ that interval as well as i am able in imparting to you some sentiments that you ought to know  your late miseries oh my dear james went too near my heart and the day that your furniture and even our bed was last seized i had the rashness to take poison  a poison my husband which though very slow is certain in its operations my doctor has discovered the occasion of my illness long ago but in compliance with my entreaties has hitherto concealed it from you  how james can i sustain the sense of my guilt instead of dying i should have lived on purpose to make your life supportable in what a condition do i leave you oh my soul whither art thou going oh james  james  pity me save me  protect me from  fro  farewell  farewell i can no more  lucia reynolds   i shed my charlotte over this epistle the tears of sensibility it was written in a faint hand the words scarce legible and every syllable spoke the disorder of the unfortunate writer when i returned it to mr reynolds he kissed it as before folded it up as a miser would have folded a bank bill of a thousand pounds surveyed it on all sides with the greatest tenderness and then deposited it in a little box of ebony  so heaven befriend me sir said he as he put up the box i would not part with this to be restored to all the fortune i had a right to inherit no barbarous mother no inhuman parent this you cannot take from me of this inestimable relic you cannot rob me this is a treasure your child can call his own in defiance of all your artifices i thank the great and good god for the blessing  oh that i could find an honest man who would lay it upon my bosom when i enter the grave for which i have long most pathetically petitioned  mr reynolds said i you see that friend now before you should i survive and if not i would recommend that office to a dear and faithful woman who would not neglect it  i had scarce finished this promise before reynolds was upon his knees and gave me as he rose with his hands clasping mine such a look of acknowledgment that i felt enter into my heart  and is there then said i is there another mrs p  and was there ever another charlotte did mr reynolds call the one his wife and and the other his mother if so  you have still reason to be contented mr reynolds the blessed society of such a wife is more than a balance for the curses keen as they are of such a mother  blessed society returned mr reynolds yes sir here is was a blessed society horrible as was the death she died the life she lived might atone even for the crime of self destruction she was eleven years sir by my side during which time we were never in prosperity and yet  such was the charm that mutually bound us  we threw adversity into despair  she was my wife upon earth  she is an angel in heaven if you sir have got the counterpart of her do not talk of pains or prisons or penalties  if there is not something wrong in your heart  it must be happy  upon this charlotte i ran over the heads of my history at which even with the softness of a desdemona he wept particularly at such parts as related to my mothers barbarity and my charlottes kindness  i did not mention cleora by name and after i he gave me for my pains a world of sighs had ended he promised to reward me with a scene or two from his own disasterous volume  but the recital of this must be reserved to a future opportunity i am this instant summoned upon indispensible business pity reynolds and pray for  charles  letter cxxvii dr melbank to h t esquire ten days have i taken to compose an agitated and i had almost said infatuated mind i have engaged myself with unusual assiduity in the business of my profession  i have read  i have written  i have idled i have toiled  alas mr templeton i am ashamed at my progress or rather at my having made no progress at all  i am still a slave to my passions  this charming woman preengaged as she is still crowds on my imagination  i have banished myself from her sight and yet i see her i have pretended an absence from town on purpose to avoid all formal communication  yet notwithstanding all this i blush to tell you i am a very miserable man my friends perceive the effect in my looks without knowing the cause  the cause i dare not mention lest i deservedly become the object of ridicule you have dear mr templeton a gentle heart and it is some pleasure to correspond with you charlotte passed the other morning by my door as it is usual with her in her way to the park and she called to know of my servant supposing me to be out of town whether i was well when she last heard from me and when i was expected to return happy was it for me that i had preinstructed my servant in case of enquiry an interview at such a crisis would have certainly destroyed all my better resolutions and yet as she went from the door as i was in the street parlour i could not avoid going to the window the blinds favored me i saw her depart  she was dressed by the hand of hebe and in my opinion more beautiful than ever i heard her sweet and tuneful voice leave her best compliments for dr melbank the sound thrilled my soul i was strongly inclined to open the door that led to the entry where she stood i got up  took hold of the door handle  drew it  set it on the jar  every word she uttered was more distinct  she cordially hoped i was quite well  should be exceedingly glad to see me upon my return to town  and desired her most affectionate compliments might be transmitted  oh mr templeton had she staid another minute i should have discovered myself and my infirmity  adieu pray for the returning reason of your  e melbank  letter cxxviii mrs p  to cleora charles i find is out of prison chiefly through the means of charlotte who has contrived to raise him up a friend in the extravagance of one dr melbank no doubt the woman buys this mans friendship at a pretty dear rate however charles is mean enough to accept of a favor by whatever means it is procured and as you have nothing to expect from his generosity i would advise you to threaten him with putting some other of his creditors in pursuit of him thus perhaps you may extort through fears what yout cannot obtain through a sense of duty  your mother e p  letter cxxix the answer from cleora i can never adopt the measures you advise to oppress charles it would only put it more out of his power to befriend me in point of money matters he gives me from time to time as much as his circumstances admit though i am not sure if the presents be not chiefly made at the instance of charlotte i perceive it is a vain endeavor to disunite them they still love and still correspond  your obedient servant cleora  letter cxxx charles to charlotte long as it is i make no apology charlotte but expect many thanks for giving you as related by himself  the continuation of mr reynoldss history i will tell you only such other of my adventures sir as more immediately led me to my present situation and that i may not unnecessarily increase your melancholy i will relate the story with as much life and humor  for i have been engaged in whimsical scenes  as my poor exhausted spirits will permit  mr reynolds sat down and began the continuation of his narrative ran thus  i shall begin this part of my history at the day i obtained after various delightful difficulties the hand of my beloved lucia who being only a farmers daughter was considered by my mother who can match yours for cruelty as an intruder in the family and therefore took every opportunity to insult her this contemptuous treatment made us resolve to leave her house and rather earn our bread by daily labor than be indebted for it to one who was constantly upbraiding us for the bounty as i was not bred to any business i was obliged to seek for such an employment as depended rather on the application and versatility of genius than any thing else having a well grounded classical education and a sprightly vein for undetached compositions i was advised by a young friend who knew the town to apply to the booksellers and endeavor to get a livelihood from the pursuits of the press while my poor lucia was to throw in her mite by attending to the needle with these views and only three guineas and a half in our pockets we left this cruel mothers house one evening pretty late taking advantage of her absence from home and set out to a neighboring town from whence we embarked in a wagon for london upon our arrival there we called on our young metropolitan friend who agreed the next morning to attend me to a printer of his acquaintance we soon through his assistance produced a lodging and for the sake of literary convenience it was in a small court that led into paternosterrow  upon going into the printers shop the master surveyed me critically and without any previous or delicate ceremony asked as soon as he understood my business  what i could do whether i had any specimens about me whether i was a verseman or a proseman whether i had ever dabbled in those doings or was only going to throw my ink about the world  my friend answered for me that i was a young man of genius who could turn my hand to any thing that i would enter into immediate employ and that my diligence might be depended on  as authorship was thus early the necessary means of eating and drinking it was not to be supposed i had much time to bestow upon the elegancies of composition upon polishing my periods arranging my arguments or decorating my sentiments good or good for nothing so many pages were to produce so many pence and therefore the main point was to have the pen almost always in my hand and scribble away for the supplies of the day generally speaking however my taskmasters the booksellers cut out my business and told me what and how much would be wanting that night  if as it is asserted there be universal charms in variety never ought man to be more contented or think himself more entertained than myself for i have often wrote round the whole circle of the sciences in twenty four hours  i purchased my breakfast by a page of politics  my dinner by a sheet of biography  my tea by history  my supper by a poem on the pleasures of the spring and my lodging which i shifted nearly as often as my subjects and much oftener than my linen by divinity the next day came into play for the morning a slice of mathematics  for noon a plate of translation and for the evening a dish of indexes my employers sir notwithstanding this labor of hercules made woeful complaints that my works did not sell that they did not pay for paper and print  that i was not known that unless i could get a popular writer to lend me his name they must decrease the copymoney  about this time poor lucias wardrobe began to decline though her lovely face was ever dressed in smiles of congratulation or in tears of sympathy  my own apparel began to be truly literary and i recollected to have often seen one of my booksellers whose name was meadows slide about his shop in the mornings till after hair dressing time in a green frock we were both of a size and i made formal proposals  this very frock sir cost me a whole octavo volume of sermons which were printed the following month under the taking title of sermons by a late right reverend prelate warranted originals and to be seen by the curious in his lordships own hand writing while i was laboring for the coat i had no other wages till i had earned that than what i could get by working after stated hours and yet it was absolutely necessary for me and my wife to subsist in the interim accordingly i sat up for two nights together and wrote a large poem of the  s  d size on conjugal tenderness entitled the faithful pair i hurried away with this the next morning to a new purchaser who said if i would leave it ten days or a fortnight he would give me his answer this proposal not suiting the situation of affairs at home i went to a second dealer in these wares who having looked at the title said he had made an oath never to burn his fingers against the blaze of poetry any more a third observed that he would sell me a parcel of poems by the pound  and a fourth hinted that if i would take the opposite side of the subject and write in support of conjugal infidelity he would treat with me  chagrined wounded desolate and disgusted i went into a pawnbrokers shop and pledged a pocketpiece of silver upon which  the value being four shillings  they lent me two and twenty pence with this modicum i bought a few necessaries and ran to offer them to the halfstarved but still uncomplaining lucia in her dear company i forgot every indignity and every care and we passed the whole evening over a mutton chop and a pot of porter with joy content and tenderness inexpressible  the next morning an hour before the time of going to work i thought something agreeable might happen from trying the heart of mr meadows and setting myself seriously down to the task while lucia was asleep i thus addressed the feelings of a bookseller  to mr meadows bookseller paternosterrow sir my wants are extreme the opportunities of supplying them are few the greatest part of those wants have been brought about by misfortune i have this day a bill coming due for house rent or i should rather have said roomrent will you this once advance a single guinea to prevent the unhappy consequences  i am your most grateful servant i r mr meadows returned by the bearer this short and laconic reply  to mr reynolds sir were your principles equal to your understanding there might be some encouragement but while i admire you for the one common honesty requires that i should despise you for the other  j meadows   upon the receipt of this audacious letter i thought my reason would have left me i threatened vengeance on the barbarous writer oh sir hear the circumstances that attended it i had many misfortunes and many debts upon me i dared not venture abroad till the shades of the night befriended me i sold the labors of my pen to this fellow on his own terms and i had entrusted him with the knowledge of my abode that i might correct what are called the proof sheets as they come from the press the wretch knew at what an advantage he took me and that he might say almost any thing with impunity but oh sir what villainy could exceed his insult at such a time  by a fellow too with whom i had scrupulously fulfilled every engagement and who knew not a syllable of me or of my affairs but from the vague breath of partial or vulgar report  i did not however answer his impudent letter but crushed it in my hand and to prevent its being seen by the too cruel and sympathizing lucia threw it into the fire  disdaining to work any more in the service of meadows i sought out a new talkmaster i left the management of the remainder of the two and twenty pence to lucia and began my search i at length made myself known to one little celebrated but very busy and was directly to begin a new family bible by a certain dean and a society of clergymen  my new master had just dined and as the cloth was removing i suppose he saw me look somewhat wishingly he was very much addicted to wit and thus facetiously began to interrogate  what i warrant me now you eat as well as i  that is begging your pardon you would if you could ten to one but you drink too  eh what a pity it is you scriberecumdasho gentry should be pestered with those plaguey passions and hankerings after meat drink and clothing zounds if i was an author  i would live like the meaning very likely the cameleon camel on my own idearers oh d  m  e you you ant half an author yet  well come since thee have such curses upon thee thee can not help em  so here susan susan he went to the door of the kitchen stairs bring up the beef bones here is one of my authors a hungry as usual  bring up also susan the suety pudding that was too little boiled a sunday and the broth that your mistress said tasted of the copper and all the bits of broken bread that you can find and make haste damme master author i am better than a father to you even before you have written a single syllable  better than a mother sir said i you assuredly are and then the tears sprang into my foolish eyes as i compared the delicate dinner that i supposed she then might be eating to the bare bones stale pudding coppery broth and broken bread that susan was now going to place before me however as i was never quite so hungry since i was born and as i knew my ever dear lucia had sufficient for a frugal meal i never eat a more hearty meal or blessed heaven with more sincerity that a meal though coarse was bestowed at all  when mr reynolds had finished the last sentence charlotte the bailiffs servant brought in the supper and his history was suspended you must therefore suspend your curiosity till i can recollect the remainder of this most interesting narrative  mean while i am yours charles    letter cxxi from the same to the same the history of mr reynolds concluded when supper was over and i had persuaded mr reynolds to drink a glass of wine he proceeded in this manner  in the midst of this literary labor and indigence a relation of lucias died and bequeathed her the sum of two hundred pounds this was a delicious windfall and i received it in bank bills a month after the persons decease violent and immediate transitions however are undesirable and dangerous the leap from poverty to plenty is truly alarming and many a mans head turns giddy in making it such was the present case i had no sooner got this precious treasure in my hands than i gave a loose to imagination as it was lucias money i could not bear the idea of using it for my purposes i considered the poor hut in which that excellent creature resided as unworthy such an inhabitant and therefore immediately and unknown to her i took two little neat apartments and furnished them to  what i knew to be her taste  i reflected upon the forlorn state of her wardrobe and i repaired it by silks laces linens etc to the amount of almost one of the hundred pounds  with these purchases which i made from time to time in the course of the first week i at a proper period made lucia acquainted and the dear creature sir was almost ready to faint at the tidings she saw the conjugal delicacy and disinterestedness of my intentions but she saw also the imprudence of laying out all our little property in finery that was wholly inconsistent with our embarrassed state and our future expectation luckily however my furniture was second hand and i had eighteen guineas still in my possession we therefore agreed to manage this with the utmost frugality till i could supply myself by writing some work that by taking time and pains with it might be likely to establish my reputation as an author after which according to the trite expression a man may lie a bed in pursuance of these oeconomical resolutions i had fixed upon my subject sketched out the plan of my design entered upon the introductory parts and began to kindle in the progress when lo i had not with all my foresight provided against certain demands which various tradespeople had on their books against me for former necessaries  one evening after i had laid aside the pen in order to enjoy the sweets of a conversation never tedious and always tender just as lucia began to entertain me with a favorite song a man came into our apartment and presented a bill for thirtyseven pounds which had been owing him and collecting to that size for upwards of two years startled as i was i hardly knew how to stammer forth an apology and the creditor perceiving my confusion took it as a token of my distress and was therefore resolved to have his money on the spot i equivocated he left me abruptly and with the authority of a creditor slapt to my dining room door with a show of indignation our song and all our harmony you may be sure was now broken and we were left to many sorrowful reflections  our affection however sir was of so delicate a nature that all the ardours of romance were realized in my conduct and even pastoral sentiments scarce did justice to the tenderness of my passion  nature had formed her for eminence and such was her mind that she bore with me the burden of anxiety and doubled the sense of better fortune at the time that she shared it but the great charm which endeared and distinguished her was that fervid fortitude that gave her strength even after the bed was torn from under her to go through the most piercing inconvenience and the hardest trials the insults i sustained however were too much for her and she grew quite melancholy and would sometimes pass whole days without being able to utter a word  at last the hour approached when all the miseries of my existence were to be collected to a point  when fortune piqued at my former defiance of her by one decisive blow  the moment at last came  which  which  you know the rest sir  spare  spare  oh spare me the repetition  lucia is in her grave  excuse  excuse me   mr reynolds my dear charlotte broke off abruptly  so must charles  p s my tears will give me leave in pity to you to inform you that i this very day am to have mr reynoldss company at dinner which may serve to show that he is no longer in a house of confinement adieu    letter cxxii charlotte to charles how truly do i pity the unforfortunate reynolds  how much am i obliged to charles for the narrative  but how infinitely do i honor him for the sentiment and intelligence of the postscript  and so you have restored the prisoner to freedom  what a fate was his lucias  ah charles how many tears did i sacrifice to her deathbed letter  merciless creditors  what a woman  what a wife did ye destroy how will templeton rejoice  how will the good melbank who is arrived congratulate charles on the service he has rendered such a character as mr reynolds  in a jail only for twentyfive pounds  a man of his brilliance  good god  but he is now at large and through my charless means  oh my friend bring us all together  what have i said  no charles  no  adieu to visits  fatal indulgencies  and yet  surely  when we think of reynolds  when his harder much harder fortunes are considered  we may be well satisfied  cannot we cherish the most tender and innocent friendship without once cherishing a guilty thought how unreasonable oh charles let us be above it  we will assuredly all have one happy meeting  i will put confidence in you because i know i can now safely trust myself farewell you shall soon hear again from  charlotte  letter cxxiii charlotte to dr melbank charlotte hears of her good doctors return to town with great pleasure particularly as she wants both his advice and company on wednesday to meet charles and an agreeable stranger  letter cxxiv dr melbank to charlotte it is impossible to resist your invitation i shall attend it  and yet is there not a little tincture of  of  of  pshaw nonsense into what idle stuff am i rambling you may depend upon me  e melbank  letter cxxv charles to charlotte mr reynolds will not be the only visitor you may expect on wednesday you will see another of your friends on that day besides dr melbank the incomparable and the unchangeable  charles  letter cxxvi charles to cleora i find that the baseminded mrs p refuses any longer to provide for the child and that she who has pillaged all the fathers effects and the sons property has the impudence to plead poverty  what pangs cleora are in store for that woman what a sickness is she preparing for her soul as to the child since no entreaties can prevail with you to trust it into my arms pray send for it directly into yours and as my affairs are now likely to mend a little i shall be able to accommodate both you and your little companion  charles  letter cxxvii dr melbank to h t esquire now sir indeed my misery is completed  i have had another interview with charlotte in the presence of charles  a stranger was there  oh mr templeton such a stranger upon his coming into the room i was greatly struck with the resemblance of features which i shall never forget at dinner charles drank to his health under the name of mr reynolds  i no sooner heard the sound than my heart ceased to beat  i felt a mixture of inexpressible misery and fell back in my chair they officiously recovered me to greater misery  whom do you think sat opposite to me sir  the only man in the world that i had injured  the nephew of that very mr reynolds who was the father of my maria and who but for some petty offense  some partial misrepresentations was to have heired the fortunes that were given to me reynolds sir said i  are those features the exact image of mr stokes the property of mr reynolds  of the very person who is now before me mr stokes sir replied he was my uncle the brother of my mother  but i was when very young most falsely painted to him and never saw him afterward he had a daughter then at a boarding school  he had so sir said i almost sobbing and that daughters name was   maria stokes said he   and that maria stokes rejoined i was my wife  and she is   where said mr reynolds  with the god that made her  but is it possible resumed i that you should be this very mr reynolds  where have you been by what means have you eluded my most industrious enquiries  i have been buried sir he returned amongst the booksellers  i have been condemned under fifty names to conceal from the gripe of the creditor a wretched body not worth the fatigue of a single search  i have never shown my face  or applied by letters to those who basely deserted me  i have hid myself in the thickness of a thousand disguises  and in short sir my kind benefactor who sits next to me will explain the rest  upon this mr templeton charles withdrew a moment with charlotte and on their return put a packet of letters into my hand containing  what do you think sir  nothing less than the history of mr reynolds  i have borrowed these letters sir and now send them in franks for your reading  look into them sir with an eye of compassion   when i had finished this perusal of them i made use of the little strength i had left to fall upon my knee  i took mr reynoldss hand and so sir said i  i have at last found out the unhappy gentleman whose natural expectations i have despoiled  why did you not leave some clue to your residence before the death of your uncle  i was only a servant in his family  i did not even know at that time that he had a nephew in being  i  i  in a word sir as this lady has furnished me with your narrative  she will be so kind to give you a sketch of mine  in the mean while let me retire into another room  i cannot support it any longer without relief  i went mr templeton into a small book closet  flung myself on a sopha which was there and burst into tears  i must make a pause   letter cxxviii the same to the same charles and charlotte after an hours absence in which i will not attempt to describe what i felt came to me each of them took a hand and led me into the apartment again  mr reynolds advanced and began to address me  we have both had our misfortunes sir said he  but i can see no trace of guilt in your conduct as to my uncle i had long buried my expectations of receiving any benefit from him nor did i ever see him but five times in my life my mother turned his heart and his passions against me and i am now rejoiced to hear she has not been the better or the richer upon that account my indulging friend charles has since you were out of the room trusted to me a paper sent him by this lady which relates all i could desire to know  nay more than i could desire  for i find my cousin is dead  you have lost your wife  alas alas sir and i  i have lost mine  he wept mr templeton and i had but too many reasons to sympathize  the delicacy of charles and charlotte during this surprising interview is not to be imagined their passion seemed to be now quite extinguished and they attended only to us  i had a thousand things to say and yet i was obliged to go away with a full heart without saying any thing to the purpose  i am your unhappy e melbank  letter cxxix charlotte to charles what a scene  what a party was yesterdays i have not heard from either dr melbank or mr reynolds consider my impatience and all that you know communicate to  charlotte p s your care of my sister was noble i receive her at your hands with many tender thanks    letter cxxx dr melbank to charles pray my dear charles forward the enclosed to mr reynolds and let illness excuse my making this letter to you so abrupt  e melbank the enclosed to mr reynolds i dreamed last night that i was the murderer of your wife  i saw her in my visions  the figure of your cousin too arose close by the side of her to reproach me  i have certainly been the unknown instrument of mischief to many  pray come to me that i may quiet my conscience  to have been even the innocenct cause of anguish is too much for a delicate heart  how intricate are the mazes of providence  i charge you to come  e melbank     letter cxxxi charles to charlotte i have only time to fold up dr melbanks note and to scribble a hasty copy of his letter to mr reynolds  that gentleman and i are this moment going to the house of that noble character  adieu charles  letter cxxxii cleora to charlotte madam i have at length brought myself to be really sorry you and charles cannot be properly reunited as i now see that the circumstances which happened prior to and since our separation would render a reunion intolerably imperfect and as you are evidently the woman of his choice i am willing to enter into articles of mutual release and try how far it is possible for your return to charles to be put upon a moral footing  i thank you madam for the papers that have past between you giving an account of your whole intercourse i am at least glad to see that charles does not dwell on the vile report that was promulgated against my reputation  in regard to any difference in our tempers and disagreement in other respects we have both smarted for them sufficiently without dragging into the account the most barbarous report that ever was invented to destroy the fame of a woman i confess to you the impossibility as things have fallen out of my ever being happy with charles  whatever he may think  i should now scorn as much the advances to so unprofitable a reconciliation as himself  we were never comfortable  at least we were never fond after the first month  i was dupe enough to listen to a lovetale made by a man upon the bachelors ramble under a fictitious name  every step we both took was romantic and had i not been as much besotted with a wild madheaded scheme as himself i might have seen prudence without going to charles and cleora were married in that kingdom scotland for repentance but the deed is done and i wish with all my heart it were undone how can you madam believe charles a constant man  can it be possible he should have such a principle in his nature ingenuity  wit  address  elegance i am ready to grant him  but fidelity to any one favorite whether wife or not is surely out of the list of things practicable you say he will after he has come to some terms with his creditors contribute to my genteeler support he writes me word he will also assist me in a proper provision for the child   if he fulfills these promises heaven knows i never desire a closer intercourse with him and i have resolved in my mind to mark this as the last letter he shall ever see or charlotte ever receive on the subject for to tell you the truth i do not see that i have divided you from him to any good purpose i do not pray for his death or my own but never did a matrimonial prisoner pray oftener or more earnestly for liberty and an honorable escape from bondage  i am madam in conclusion of our correspondence your humble servant cleora p s i hear that charless mother frets and laughs alternately at the receipt of his retaliating letter she says she will persecute him for it without mercy i should hope she would not put her threats in execution but i have friendship enough for his safety to beg you will put him upon his guard    letter cxxiii charles to charlotte alas charlotte i have been witness to another scene more tender even than the first reynolds and melbank were an hour together without the intrusions of a third person and when i joined them they were tenderly locked in embraces the poor doctor is exceedingly ill and we both sat by his bedside all night about twelve oclock this morning he fell into a short slumber and reynolds went to bed i begin indeed now charlotte to consider our pangs of separation as trifling in opposition to what i have lately heard and lately seen dr m  mentioned you several times in the course of the night with the greatest marks of respect  kissed the picture of the deceased maria  wept again over the fate of lucia  pitied charles  and bathed the hands of mr reynolds in tears  i shall return to him again as soon as i have put a wafer under this for the satisfaction of the sympathizing charlotte  charles  letter cxxiv dr melbank to h t esquire i am held up in my bed  and i have past the night in a fever  do not think me superstitious if i say  if i prophecy  that this will be the last time you will receive a letter from me poor reynoldss situation teras me one way and my affection for charlotte another  i love her yet sir  yes mr templeton guilty as i know myself  god knows i love her yet  i have the killing circumstances too of having charles constantly before me and exerting himself more indefatigably than my nurse  his hand is often in mine  he smoothes my bedcloaths  he offers me medicines  he keeps a deathlike silence in the room  he most tenderly avoids speaking of charlotte  i am afraid he still suspects my lurking passion what can possibly have made me thus weak i am a child  i am a child mr templeton  may god bless you  e melbank  letter cxxv charles to charlotte twelve oclock at night the doctor is quite delirious charlotte  he cries out by fits  and enquires for mr reynolds  mr reynolds appears and he bids him avoid his presence before his fever had reduced him to this state he sat up in his night gown and ordered the lawyer to come to his bedside  he waved us out of the room smilingly  the servants were called as witnesses  a will was made  we reentered and he placed us both on different sides of his bed i am afraid dear friends said he i have suffered from visiting lately a poor woman in the fleet prison  i have reason to think the fever she has since idied of is of the contagious kind  ll as i was i visited her on the very evening after i had found the long lost mr reynolds  my spirits were then very bad    i desire you will take the bare possibility of it for granted  i must not suffer you to enter my chamber again my friends till i am better  when i am certain as to the nature of my disorder you shall be again with joy admitted till then  farewell  farewell  the doctor pressed our hands very softly  desired us to wash the fingers in hungary water  and then threw the sheet over his face touched at the solemnly affecting manner in which he spoke reynolds and i withdrew and have not dared to enter against his express inhibitions since  charles  letter cxxvi james spedman to charles sir my poor dear master orders me to tell you that his physician has pronounced his disorder to be catching and requests you will on no account come near the house and that you will not suffer mr reynolds to leave london  your humble servant j spedman  letter cxxvii charles to charlotte affection has i fear hurried me into danger  i past the best part of the last night in the bedchamber of dr melbank  no fear of his discovering me  he knows no one  his situation cannot possibly be described  still does he lie charlotte in the struggles of death  his lips silent his eye closed  and the sigh breaking laboriously from his bosom  i kissed his hand  i could not help it charlotte  it was the hand that saved me from destruction  he loves charlotte too  some veneration is due to him for that   a loose paper lay on his pillow  i have pillaged it  and the theft has been repaid by an almost brokn heart  read it charlotte  what a character is this to the last pray assiduously for his recovery   charles the paper to charles  charlotte and mr reynolds let those to whom this loose sheet written at different snatches is addressed religiously observe the sentiments it contains  be the friendship of charles and charlotte ever inviolate  when they die it is desired they will order themselves to be placed in my family vault at  let mr reynolds write a line of forgiveness on my tombstone it will soothe me   mr templeton is requested to attend my funeral  charlotte is pathetically invited to put on mourning   alas alas  where am i wandering  foolish  foolish melbank  i have quite lost myself  let me then while sense is returning use the precious interval to desire my will may be opened and the articles performed the day after my death   e melbank     letter cxxviii charlotte to charles deeply as i am affected for the amiable dr melbank i cannot excuse your rashness in going to him after interdiction  and running the hazard of losing another valuable life take some advice upon the matter i conjure you and let me know by constant messages how the good doctor and my best friend go on surely  surely such esteemed characters will be yet restored in pity to their admirers and for the service of mankind  charlotte  letter cxxix charles to charlotte our best friend is no more i have power only to write the sentence and wrap up into a cover the letter that brought the news how will the tears stream from your dear eyes at the tidings  charles the enclosed james spedman to charles sir my excellent master is amongst the angels he departed this life in the forest miseries of a putrid fever this morning a little after day break he was sensible to every thing and knew every body about him about two hours before he left the world the names of charles mr reynolds and one or two more were several times repeated he clasped his hands together and employed his last breath in blessing you all after this he turned upon his pillow and though he exhibited the greatest signs of pain remained speechless till he expired  i was with him all the time  i am not afraid of catching any bad sickness in performing my duty to the best man and the best master that ever lived  god almighty knows best in such cases what to do but i am sure he could not be pleased if i like the rest of the servants had neglected so worthy a gentleman in such a situation and i shall ever honor you sir for the courage your friendship gave you to come and look at the good doctor when other people run away from him i have been nineteen years his servant sir on and off and he has many times saved my life  i certainly shall not now leave him while he is upon the earth and yet the physician says he must be put into the ground directly  i am sir your most humble servant james spedman     letter cxxx charles to h t esquire the large packet of letters that i send you will at once apologize and account for my long silence neither charlotte mr reynolds or your friend have of late been able to take up the pen it was this day month that the body of our most worthy benefactor was committed to the earth  i do most truly assure you that the affluence in which his unequalled generosity has left me by no means compensate the pleasure i had in his society and the satisfaction i received from his life  he has divided the bulk of his fortunes amongst three persons my templeton who certainly could form no possible expectation of his bounty here follows a faithful extract from his will    item to my beloved friend charles i bequeath my dwelling house in st jamessstreet with all its furniture plate etc etc   item i bequeath to charlotte in testimony of my esteem for her virtue and reverence for her misfortunes the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds to be paid immediately on my decease or as soon afterward as the said sum can be conveniently drawn from the funds where lie certain moneys mentioned in other parts of this my last testiment   item i give and bequeath to my servant james spedman one hundred pounds sterling   item to charles esquire i bequeath one thousand pounds for the use of cleora to be paid out of my cash now lying and being in the funds   item i bequeath to the said charles esquire my sussex estate subjected to the yearly rent of two hunpounds to be paid into the hands of j reynolds esquire which is a debt due to the said j reynolds esquire for many years   item to the aforesaid j reynolds esquire in consideration of interest on the said debt my houses lands and properties whatsoever and wheresoever lying and being in the island of jamaica   item i bequeath to charlotte all my pictures in my library with all my books paintings and the miniature of my dear wife maria hanging over the library chimney piece   item i charge the said sussex estate given to charles esquire with the annual deduction of one hundred pounds to be paid to charlotte during her natural life on every eighteenth day of august being the anniversary of that ladys birth   item i give and bequeath to h templeton esquire one hundred guineas for a mourning ring and any other testimonies of friendship that he may choose to employ it in   item i give and bequeath to charlotte the watch and some trinkets lying in a little gold box in my front parlour drawers also my old and favorite dog pompey with an annuity of five pounds during his natural life to be paid out of the sussex estate over and above the annuity of one hundred pounds  can any words oh my dear templeton be adequate to such circumstances  and yet there is not a single person concerned who would not rather enjoy the dear company of the testator than the splendid evidences of his tenderness and attention  and then to die as he did in the meridian of life  in a situation so pathetic at a time so delicately critical blessed for ever blessed be his memory upon earth  rich and abundant be his rewards in heaven never did i see such genuine unaffected grief and gratitude that mix themselves in the sympathy of charlotte and mr reynolds   cleoras letter also upon the subject does her honor   reynolds and i live at present in the good doctors house and we are so often reminded of his image and his goodness in every thing about us that it is not in the power of gold to charm our grief   that i have still a sigh for charlotte is but too certain and i would most willingly reject all that i am now worth and after all deductions that will i find be a considerable fortune  yes templeton i would yield up every shilling  be again involved  again a prisoner  again liable to all the insults of an unfortunate man  and depend for the remainder of my days upon the precarious efforts of my own hands  had i this minute the privilege of of leading her by the hand to the foot of the altar   i conjure you to come to town and let us in the first place do justice to our benefactor by erecting to his memory a suitable monument and let us inscribe on it such sentiments as express our grief and our gratitude in the most lively manner  charles  finis
