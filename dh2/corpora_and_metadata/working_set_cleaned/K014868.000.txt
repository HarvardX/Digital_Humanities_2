marlborough while crowds of princes your deserts proclaim proud in their number to enroll your name while emperors to you commit their cause and annas praises crown the vast applause accept great leader what the muse indites that in ambitious verse records your fights fired and transported with a theme so new ten thousand wonders opening to my view shine forth at once sieges and storms appear and wars and conquests fill the important year rivers of blood i see and hills of slain an iliad rising out of one campaign the haughty gaul beheld with towering pride his ancient bounds enlarged on every side pirenes lofty barriers were subdued and in the midst of his wide empire stood ausonias states the victor to restrain opposed their appenines and alps in vain nor found themselves with strength of rocks immured behind their everlasting hills secured the rising danube its long race began and half its course through the new conquests ran amazed and anxious for her sovraigns fates germania trembled through a hundred states great leopold himself was seized with fear he gazed around but saw no succor near he gazed and half abandoned to despair his hopes on heaven and confidence in prayer to brittains queen the nations turn their eyes on her resolves the western world relies confiding still amidst its dire alarms in annas councils and in churchills arms thrice happy britain from the kingdoms rent to sit the guardian of the continent that sees her bravest son advanced so high and flourishing so near her princes eye thy favorites grow not up by fortunes sport or from the crimes or follies of a court on the firm basis of desert they rise from long tried faith and friendships holy ties their sovraigns welldistinguishd smiles they share her ornaments in peace her strength in war the nation thanks them with a public voice by showers of blessings heaven approves their choice envy it self is dumb in wonder lost and factions strive who shall applaud em most soon as soft vernal breezes warm the sky brittanias colors in the zephyrs fly her chief already has his march begun crossing the provinces himself had won till the moselle appearing from afar retards the progress of the moving war delightful stream had nature bid her fall in distant climes far from the perjured gaul but now a purchase to the sword she lies her harvests for uncertain owners rise each vineyard doubtful of its master grows and to the victors bowl each vintage flows the discontented shades of slaughtered hosts that wandered on her banks her heroes ghosts hoped when they saw brittanias arms appear the vengeance due to their great deaths was near our godlike leader ever the stream he past the mighty scheme of all his labors cast forming the wondrous year within his thought his bosom glowed with battles yet unfought the long laborious march he first surveys and joins the distant danube to the maese between whose floods such pathless forests grow such mountains rise so many rivers flow the toil looks lovely in the heroes eyes and danger serves but to enhance the prize big with the fate of europe he renews his dreadful course and the proud foe pursues amidst the sultry gales his temples beat infected by the burning scorpions heat till on the borders of the maine he finds defensive shadows and refreshing winds our british youth with inborn freedom bold unnumberd scenes of servitude behold nations of slaves with tyranny debased their makers image more than half defaced hourly instructed as they urge their toil to prize their queen and love their native soil still to the rising sun they take their way through clouds of dust and gain upon the day when now the neckar on its friendly coast with cooling streams revives the fainting host that cheerfully its labors passed forgets the midnight watches and the noonday heats over prostrate towns and palaces they pass now covered over with weeds and hid in grass breathing revenge whilst anger and disdain fire every breast and boil in every vein here shattered walls like broken rocks from far rise up in hideous views the guilt of war whilst here the vine over hills of ruin climbs industrious to conceal great bourbons crimes at length the fame of englands hero drew eugenio to the glorious interview great souls by instinct to each other turn demand alliance and in friendship burn a sudden friendship while with stretched out rays they meet each other mingling blaze with blaze polished in courts and hardened in the field renowned for conquest and in council skilled their courage dwells not in a troubled flood of mounting spirits and fermenting blood lodged in the soul with virtue overruled inflamed by reason and by reason cooled in hours of peace content to be unknown and only in the field of battle shown to souls like these in mutual friendship joined heaven dares entrust the cause of human kind brittanias graceful sons appear in arms her harrasd troops the heros presence warms whilst the high hills and rivers all around with thundering peals of british shouts resound doubling their speed they march with fresh delight eager for glory and require the fight so the stanch hound the trembling deer pursues and smells his footsteps in the tainted dews the tedious track unravling by degrees but when the scent comes warm in every breeze fired at the near approach he shoots away on his full stretch and bears upon his prey the march concludes the various realms are past the immortal schellenberg appears at last like hills the aspiring ramparts rise on high like valleys at their feet the trenches lie battries on battries guard each fatal pass threatening destruction rows of hollow brass tube behind tube the dreadful entrance keep whilst in their wombs ten thousand thunders sleep great churchill owns charmed with the glorious sight his march oerpaid by such a promised fight the western sun now shot a feeble ray and faintly scattered the remains of day evening approached but oh what hosts of foes were never to behold that evening close thickning their ranks and wedged in firm array the close compacted brittons win their way in vain the cannon their thronged war defaced with tracks of death and laid the battle waste still pressing forward to the fight they broke through flames of sulphur and a night of smoke till slaughtered legions fill the trench below and bear their fierce avengers to the foe high on the works the mingling hosts engage the battle kindled into tenfold rage with showers of bullets and with storms of fire burns in full fury heaps on heaps expire whole nations trampled into dirt and bruised in one promiscuous carnage lie confused how many generous brittons meet their doom new to the field and heroes in the bloom the illustrious youths that left their native shore to march where brittons never marched before o fatal love of fame o glorious heat only destructive to the brave and great after such toils overcome such dangers past stretched on bavarian ramparts breathe their last but hold my muse may no complaints appear nor blot the day with an ungrateful tear while marlbro lives britannias stars dispense a friendly light and shine in innocence plunging through seas of blood his fiery steed where ever his friends retire or foes succeed those he supports these drives to sudden flight and turns the various fortune of the fight forbear great man renowned in arms forbear to brave the thickest terrors of the war nor hazard thus confused in crowds of foes britannias safety and the worlds repose let nations anxious for thy life abate this scorn of danger and contempt of fate thou livst not for thy self thy queen demands conquest and peace from thy victorious hands kingdoms and empires in thy fortune join and europes destiny depends on thine at length the longdisputed pass they gain by crowded armies fortified in vain the war breaks in the fierce bavarians yield and see their camp with british legions filled so belgian mounds bear on their shattered sides the seas whole weight increased with swelling tides but if the rushing wave a passage finds enraged by watery moons and warring winds the trembling peasant sees his country round covered with tempests and in oceans drowned the few surviving foes dispersed in flight refuse of swords and gleanings of a fight in every russling wind the victor hear and marlbros form in every shadow fear till the dark cope of night with kind embrace befriends the rout and covers their disgrace to donnawert with unresisted force the gay victorious army bends its course the growth of meadows and the pride of fields whatever spoils bavarias summer yields the danubes great increase britannia shares the food of armies and support of wars with magazines of death destructive balls and cannons doomed to batter landaus walls the victor finds each hidden cavern stored and turns their fury on their guilty lord deluded prince how is thy greatness crossed and all the gaudy dream of empire lost that proudly set thee on a fancied throne and made imaginary realms thy own thy troops that now behind the danube join shall shortly seek for shelter from the rhine nor find it there surrounded with alarms thou hopest the assistance of the gallic arms the gallic arms in safety shall advance and crowd thy standards with the power of france while to console thy doom the aspiring gaul shares thy destruction and adorns thy fall unbounded courage and compassion joined tempring each other in the victors mind alternately proclaim him good and great and make the hero and the man complete long did he strive thobdurate foe to gain by proffered grace but long he strove in vain till fired at length he thinks it vain to spare his rising wrath and gives a loose to war in vengeance roused the soldier fills his hand with sword and fire and ravages the land a thousand villages to ashes turns in crackling flames a thousand harvests burns to the thick woods the woolly flocks retreat and mixed with bellowing herds confusedly bleat their trembling lords the common shade partake and cries of infants sound in every brake the listening soldier fixed in sorrow stands loath to obey his leaders just commands the leader grieves by generous pity swayed to see his just commands so well obeyed but now the trumpet terrible from far in shriller clangors animates the war confedrate drums in fuller consort beat and ecchoing hills the loud alarm repeat gallias proud standards to bavarias joined unfurl their gilded lillies in the wind the daring prince his blasted hopes renews and while the thick embattled host he views stretched out in deep array and dreadful length his heart dilates and glories in his strength the fatal day its mighty course began that the grieved world had long desired in vain states that their new captivity bemoaned armies of martyrs that in exile groaned sighs from the depth of gloomy dungeons heard and prayers in bitterness of soul preferred europes loud cries that providence assailed and annas ardent vows at length prevailed the day was come when heaven designed to show his care and conduct of the world below behold in awful march and dread array the long extended squadrons shape their way death in approaching terrible imparts an anxious horror to the bravest hearts yet do their beating breasts demand the strife and thirst of glory quells the love of life the british souls low images disclaim the heat of vengeance and desire of fame oerlook the foe advantaged by his post lessen his numbers and contract his host though fens and floods possessed the middle space that unprovoked they would have feared to pass nor fens nor floods can stop britannias bands when her proud foe ranged on their borders stands but o my muse what numbers will thou find to sing the furious troops in battle joined methinks i hear the drums tumultuous sound the victors shouts and dying groans confound the dreadful burst of cannon rend the skies and all the thunder of the battle rise twas then great marlbros mighty soul was proved that in the shock of charging hosts unmoved amidst confusion horror and despair examined all the dreadful scenes of war in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed to fainting squadrons sent the timely aid inspired repulsed battalions to engage and taught the doubtful battle where to rage so when an angel by divine command with rising tempests shakes a guilty land such as of late over pale britannia past calm and serene he drives the furious blast and pleased the almightys orders to perform rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm but see the haughty housholdtroops advance the dread of europe and the pride of france the wars whole art each private soldier knows and with a genrals love of conquest glows proudly he marches on and void of fear laughs at the shaking of the british spear vain insolence with native freedom brave the meanest briton scorns the highest slave contempt and fury fire their souls by turns each nations glory in each warrior burns each fights as in his arm the important day and all the fate of his great monarch lay a thousand glorious actions that might claim triumphant laurels and immortal fame confused in crowds of glorious actions lie and troops of heroes undistinguished die o dormer how can i behold thy fate and not the wonders of thy youth relate how can i see the gay the brave the young fall in the cloud of war and lie unsung in joys of conquest he resigns his breath and filled with englands glory smiles in death the rout begins the gallic squadrons run and rush in crowds to meet the fate they shun thousands of fiery steeds with wounds transfixed floating in gore with their drowned masters mixed midst heaps of broken spears and standards lie and in the danubes bloody whirlpools die troops of bold youths born on the distant soan or sounding borders of the rapid rhone or where the sein her flowery fields divides or where the loire through winding vineyards glides in heaps the rolling billows sweep away and into scythian seas their bloated corpse convey from bleinheims towers the gaul with wild affright beholds the various havoc of the fight his waving banners that so often had stood planted in fields of death and streams of blood so used the guarded enemy to reach and rise triumphant in the fatal breach or pierce the broken foes remotest lines the hardy veteran with tears resigns unfortunate tallard oh who can name the pangs of rage of sorrow and of shame that with mixed tumult in thy bosom swelled when first thou saw thy bravest troops repelled thine only son pierced with a deadly wound choked in his blood and gasping on the ground thy self in bondage by the victor kept the chief the father and the captive wept an english muse is touched with generous woe and in the unhappy man forgets the foe greatly distressed thy loud complaints forbear blame not the turns of fate and chance of war give thy brave foes their due nor blush to own the fatal field by such great leaders won the field whence famed eugenio bore away only the second honors of the day with floods of gore that from the vanquished fell the marshes stagnate and the rivers swell mountains of slain lie heaped upon the ground or midst the roarings of the danube drowned a captive host the conqueror detains in painful bondage and inglorious chains even those who scape the fetters and the sword nor seek the fortunes of a happier lord their raging king dishonours to complete marlbros great work and finish the defeat from memminghens high domes and ausburgs walls the distant battle drives the insulting gauls freed by the terror of the victors name the rescued states his great protection claim whilst ulme the approach of her delivrer waits and longs to open her obsequious gates the heros breast still swells with great designs in every thought the towering genius shines if to the foe his dreadful course he bends over the wide continent his march extends if sieges in his laboring thoughts are formed camps are assaulted and an army stormed if to the fight his active soul is bent the fate of europe turns on its event what distant land what region can afford an action worthy his victorious sword where will he next the flying gaul defeat to make the series of his toils complete where the swollen rhine rushing with all its force divides the hostile nations in its course while each contracts its bounds or wider grows enlarged or straightened as the river flows on gallias side a mighty bulwark stands that all the wide extended plain commands twice since the war was kindled has it tried the victors rage and twice has changed its side as often whole armies with the prize oerjoyd have the long summer on its walls employed hither our mighty chief his arms directs hence future triumphs from the war expects and though the dog star had its course begun carries his arms still nearer to the sun fixed on the glorious action he forgets the change of seasons and increase of heats no toils are painful that can danger show no climes unlovely that contain a foe the roving gaul to his own bounds restrained learns to encamp within his native land but soon as the victorious host he spies from hill to hill from stream to stream he flies such dire impressions in his heart remain of marlbros sword and hockstets fatal plain in vain britannias mighty chief besets their shady coverts and obscure retreats they fly the conquerors approaching fame that bears the force of armies in his name austrias young monarch whose imperial sway sceptres and thrones are destined to obey whose boasted ancestry so high extends that in the pagan gods his lineage ends comes from afar in gratitude to own the great supporter of his fathers throne what tides of glory to his bosom ran clasped in the embraces of the godlike man how were his eyes with pleasing wonder fixed to see such fire with so much sweetness mixed such easy greatness such a graceful port so turned and finished for the camp or court achilles thus was formed with every grace and nireus shone but in the second place thus the great father of almighty rome his features flusht with an immortal bloom that cythereas fragrant breath bestowed in all the charms of his bright mother glowed the royal youth by marlbros presence charmed taught by his counsels by his actions warmed on landau with redoubled fury falls discharges all his thunder on its walls over mines and caves of death provokes the eight and learns to conquer in the heros sight the british chief for mighty toils renowned increased in titles and with conquests crowned to belgian coasts his tedious march renews and the long windings of the rhine pursues clearing its borders from usurping foes and blessed by rescued nations as he goes treves fears no more freed from its dire alarms and traerbach feels the terror of his arms seated on rocks her proud foundations shake while marlbro presses to the dire attack plants all his battries bids his cannon roar and shows how landau might have fallen before scared at his near approach great louis fears vengeance reserved for his declining years forgets his thirst of universal sway and scarce can teach his subjects to obey his arms he finds on vain attempts employed the ambitions projects of his race destroyed the work of ages sunk in one campaign and lives of millions sacrificed in vain such are the effects of annas royal cares by her britannia great in foreign wars ranges through nations wheresoeer disjoined without the wonted aid of sea and wind by her the unfettered isters states are free and taste the sweets of english liberty but who can tell the joys of those that lie within the constant influence of her eye whilst in diffusive showers her bounties fall like heavens indulgence and descend on all secure the happy succor the distressed make every subject glad and a whole people blessed thus would i fain britannias wars rehearse in the smooth records of a faithful verse that if such numbers can over time prevail may tell posterity the wondrous tale when actions unadorned are faint and weak cities and countries must be taught to speak gods may descend in factions from the skies and rivers from their oozy beds arise fiction may deck the truth with spurious rays and round the hero cast a borrowed blaze marlbros exploits appear divinely bright and proudly shine in their own native light raised of themselves their genuin charms they boast and those who paint em truest praise em most finis books
