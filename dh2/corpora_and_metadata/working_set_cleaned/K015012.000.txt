the case of mr law truly stated in answer to a pamphlet entitled a letter to mr law  lonon printed for a moore near st pauls and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster      price sixpence  the case of mr law truly stated sir there has been a pamphlet published here entitiled a letter to you mr law which has partly banterd you and partly flattered you in a kind of a flourishing but superficial way leaving us altogether in the dark at the close as to the authors meaning or indeed whether he has any meaning or no other than to have you spoken of and made a little obnoxious and this indeed seems to be the principal design of the book if as i say above there is any real design in it or if not this then by setting out your great capacities and perhaps more than your own modesty will suffer you to acknowledge prepare us to expect some great things from you here and to receive them well when they shall be proposed  i have observed among the boys in our streets  with your pardon for the allusion when sometimes one more quarrelsome than his fellows falls upon another and offers him any violence that the ordinary return of the injured boy is thus let me alone i dont meddle with you the natural justice in that reply however boyish is very pungent and as this book called a letter or the letter called a book has thus offered you a piece of simple empty unmeaning violence it would be a full answer for mr law to say to the rhetocial author no more than this let me alone i dont meddle with you  but since mr law is come among us and though he does not meddle with us we will meddle with him give me leave sir to address you in another manner perhaps with more plainness and fewer flourishes yet with more justice to you and as much to our selves in order to this i must first ask your leave to follow him a little in his too partial history of your late transactions abroad as also in his parallel with ours at home  what you did in france and how or to what extravagance things were run up there is nothing at all to us besides if this authors history of you is just viz that your scheme was right and that the extravagant advance of things was against your judgment and opposed by you with all your might but that you were overruled by those who had an influence at court at that time and who had worse designs i say if his history is just all the disasters which have happened there are nothing at all to you but on the contrary he supposes you had been able to have carried on all your schemes with success and every thing would have answered it self and that you were so far from being the instrument of ruin to the french nation that they were only ruined by your being overruled by those that had an influence as court at that time if this be true all his long blank may be filled up without any prejudice to your character or without putting any body in apprehension either of what you may do or of what others may project to do by your means or by your assistance among us  this book called a letter gives a long detail of your abilities your skill in calculations your being a man whose talent and genius lay particularly in figures who had thereby a superior and uncommon skill in those games which depend chiefly on calculation who had visited most of the courts of europe and made your observations of every thing relating to the management of their finances and after he has thus set you off is every jot as favorable to your projects intimating that they were such as would have supported themselves and that the principles on which they were founded were good that the whole structure was overthrown by nothing but the excessive rise of the stock run up by the rash and sudden humor of the people not only of france but even of all the nations of europe who in such prodigious numbers flocked at that time to paris to get into them  now sir not to flatter you with all these fine things which i humbly presume to say you know your self to be false and which you cannot but smile at the reading of knowing how unfairly though to your advantage your case is there stated give me leave with all decency and respect to your person to tell the world that if mr law himself was to give a true and genuine history of himself with respect to the part which he acted in france it would be quite another way and he would acknowledge that great part of those fine things which are said of him in the said letter either are not true in fact or ought to have quite another turn given them seeing they are set in a wrong light and our eyes are turned from a true to a delusive perspective in our view both of his conduct and of his design  previous to this sir give me leave to say that all this which the letter has been pleased to say of mr law and of his designs is no more or less but what may and perhaps with the same justice be said of the late directors of the south sea company of whom since our eyes have been open to some of the secret movements of that affair we have said so many gross things and whom we have treated with such contempt  it cannot be said nor as i have heard was it ever pretended that sir john blunt or the abdicated mr knight could imagine or did suppose that ever the stock of the south sea could rise to so surprising a height as by the avarice and humor of the people afterward appeared they have not been charged with forming any schemes upon a supposed advance of such a magnitude nor indeed was it possible they should all the rise was astonishment and surprise nor can it be denied but that sir john blunt himself pretended to be against the advance of the stock and was heard in the height of his prosperity very often to say that the madness of the people would ruin them all  on the other hand neither did mr law in france forbear to make use of and form as great and if i may say so as impracticable projects upon the foot of the popular madness of the people and perhaps worse in their kind than ever sir john blunt or the directors formed here which projects unwieldly in themselves and unable to perform added their weight to the overthrow of mr law and his schemes when but a minute accident gave them a check even just as those others did to sir john blunt and his schemes when they received a shock from a like accident as the other  and now sir as this part may unfold some arcana both in your management among the french courtiers and in the management of our c  among the south sea directors which are not yet fully penetrated by us no not by some of those who were very nearly concerned in them give me leave to run a short parallel between the two schemes or rather between the management respectively on either side and we shall see into the reason of the overthrow of both perhaps farther than we ever saw yet  mr law s first step says the letter was to establish a bank which receiving and paying considerable sums for the government lending money at the low interest of   per cent discounting bills issuing a great number of notes payable at demand and causing those notes to be answered with the utmost exactness raised its credit to such a height as made its notes be   or   per cent better than specie and all the designs to ruin the credit of that bank or its director gained the highest reputation to both  the first step sir john blunt and the directors of the south sea company took was to make a proposal to the parliament for the paying the public debts of the nation by ingrafting all the debts of the public into the south sea stock and enabling the government to discharge the funds by reducing the interest to   per cent and by yielding to the government out of the advance made upon the stock a sum of millions in money in a certain time  had either mr law or sir john blunt contented themselves with the utmost that they could either expect from these several establishments or so much as believe to be possible at that time they had still retained the general applause of the country they were in and not the first been forced to fly from the fury of the rabble and the last be attainted sorefaulted confiscated and hated  but to go on mr law finding himself at the head of a bank whose credit as above was   per cent better than specie a thing never heard of in england fate and his working head pushed him upon innumerable projects some of them impracticable and imaginary as the missisipps others of them vast immense and unmanagable as that of raising the general farms four millions a year and yet throwing off all the burdensome part of the taxes and giving them up to the people such as the duties upon flesh fish fruit wine and fuel taking the management of the whole revenue of france upon themselves and dismissing  0000 collectors tollgatherers and other officers who subsisted on the spoils of the people all which was done not with a real view to be able to support it by any other way than the public fame and credit of the scheme for that was impossible but to raise up the credit to a stupendous height and so to perform if he really intended to perform all those impossible things out of the plunder of those people whose avarice dupd them into such a frenzy as to give  0 0 per cent for shares in his bubble  how then can any man say that mr law opposed the rising of stock mr law could not but know that advancing a small real value by credit to a great imaginary value was the only way to support all those vast undertakings and that if that credit lasted or so long as it lasted those undertakings might be upheld and therefore it was that he every day went into some new project broached some new proposal however monstrous and impracticable to keep up the spirits of the people which he had raised in so surprising a manner such was the undertaking coinage for nine years the farm of tobacco the east india company and the missisippi such was the undertaking eighteen hundred millions of public debts and the managing the whole public revenue such was erecting manufactures making canals and navigations building new cities and the like  the author of the letter forgets or perhaps was not enough in the secret of mr laws history to mention his grave resolution to crush entirely all the english stocks and sink their credit and the several wise measures not to say cunning measures he entered into for the performing it and in which he was bit by some gentlemen who understand english stocks better than he did and in which simple project to say no worse of it he lost about one hundred and sixty thousand pistoles which he paid difference money in all which i never saw any of his craft except it was in taking care that france should not hear of it in which also he was more beholden to the modesty of the english gentlemen he was concerned with who valued their money enough but despised the gasconade of it than to his own policy  come we back to the long scene of management in france while the stock kept up its prodigious height how many new creations of stock fifty millions at once did mr law crave at a time till  00 millions of new stock was granted him all to be sold at the monstrous advance which the stock then went at  it cannot be doubted that had  00 millions of stock been actually transferred and sold at the price which it then was advanced to namely from  000 to  0 0 per cent it must have enabled mr law not only to have paid off all the public debts and done all the great things he had proposed but even an hundred times as many he might not only have peopled missisippi but america and have planted a new world if he could have found land to place it on and the purchase of what he had so created could not have been paid for by all the money plate and jewels in europe  let us go back to the directors of the south sea company they prompted by the same surprising advance upon their stock went on in their degree to innumerable vast conceptions how many projects and schemes lay before them no less than taking in the east india company and their trade the african company and their trade the bank and their business and at last all the customs by their credit they were to dissolve the taxes at once clear the revenue of all its anticipations they were to advance all the money the parliament would have occasion to grant and the world began to think once they would make themselves parliament government and every thing what they might have done or rather what they might not have done that way or what mr law might not have done in france had they both gone on is scarce to be expressed but nascitur ridiculus mus the parallel goes on still both were overturned by their own bulk the unperforming machines blew themselves up by the force of their own motion and the projectors are overwhelmed with them  so engineers that spring an illchargd mine sink in the ruin of their own design  as mr law to supply the monstrous demands which he had brought upon his company by taking upon them   00 millions of debts coined every day new grants of stock which the humor of the messeurs de quincampoix early found chapmen to take off at the most prodigious and extravagant prices so our directors formed as often as they thought fit new subscriptions upon their stock to the tune of     or  0 millions at a time and at the prodigious advance of  00  00 to  000 per cent which the gentlemen crowding every day to exchange alley found means to take off their hands at the most monstrous and extravagant prices that they could have the face to put them up at and at an advance beyond it  they do the directors of the south sea company injustice in the highest degree who pretend to say that they could not have answered the highest dividend that they ever proposed and for the longest time that it was ever proposed namely    years had all the money for which those subscriptions were taken in at been either paid to them or secured to be paid to them and i appeal to the men of figures let them be as partial as they please if they are but just to cast up what a subscription of   millions and a half at  000 and  0 millions at   00 per cent as was talked of at that time would not have done the only injustice done by the directors in making those proposals of dividends was that it was evident these subscriptions on which they were founded like mr laws new millions of coined stock could never be paid for that it was impossible and that not all the money or credit of the nation could perform it  and this made the directors by a weak and scandalous loan part with all the money and paper they had to the tune of    millions to support the circulations of things in the town which as they did no doubt see or might have seen could never have been paid and which yet if they had not done their stock could not have held up its head a week together  it may be true and i believe it would have been true that if the company had stood and had proposed a fifth subscription at  000 or even at   00 per cent it would have been subscribed and  00 per cent or perhaps  00 per cent would have been paid in though to have done it the company must not only have issued all the money and bills they had but all the circulating cash and all the paper credit of the nation must have been strained to the utmost  but it must also have been true that after the company had been thus possessed of the whole treasure of the kingdom if they had not found some way or other to have issued it again every time a new payment on those subscriptions had been due those payments could not have been made the reason is plain that like a board of play when the box has got all the money of the gamesters if it does not think fit to lend it out to them again the game is at an end they can play no more so those men having thus possessed all the cash of the nation that is to say all that could be come at all that was to be had and all the credit also that the men of credit were able to answer if they did not think fit to issue it again on some foot or other the play would have been at an end no men could have made good their payments and all sorts of confusion would have followed  this was exactly parallel to mr laws case in france who likewise made a dividend upon his stock when it was about  000 per cent intimating that he was able to do the like in proportion to any advance which the stock might have been raised to as doubtless he would have done had all the stock which he daily created been purchased at the advanced price which it was current at when created and paid for too for what might not he do who could create fifty or an hundred millions of stock when he pleased and sell it immediately at  000 per cent all the difficulty was that indeed he might while the humor of the people lasted sell his stock at that price but that all the wealth of europe could not pay for it and so as i said before the machine burst it self by its own weight and the violence of its own motion  and shall any man come now and compliment you mr law with telling the world how equal your genius is to the vast designs you had laid and that it was only your being overruled by those who had an influence at court that overthrew it all  to be plain sir and not to injure truth or you so much the case was only this that those people who had the influence at court finding that you had laid schemes too large for the whole treasure of the world to answer and that you only screwed up the adventurous humor of the people by starting every day new surprises new oceans for them to launch out into so supporting one chimera by another building infinite opon infinite which it was evident must sink all at last into infinite confusion i say seeing this they thought fit to give a check to the velocity of the motion in hopes to have let things fall gently and gradually but the machine being unweildy and all the parts depending upthe progression of the foremost like a strong current hastily and effectually stopped the waters at the first check overflowed all the country round them and still not able to find a vent forward reverted with an ebb a thousand times more surious than the flux which first brought them on and it was then no wonder that mr law could not stand it twas really more a wonder that those great men whose act and deed that catastrophe was had power left to carry him off as they did and i believe sir you are the first man that ever came clear off if you may think your self safe from the resentment of a whole nation and with so much of the ruins of their country in his pocket  just thus sir has it been here in its kind happy had it been if the great persons concerned here of whom sir john blunt and his fraternity have been little more than the shadow had as much in time and from the same principle of concern for the public good put a check to the monstrous growth of things which they could not but foresee and mr aislabie tells us he did foresee would at last blow up and end in confusion and destruction  but on the contrary they went on to the last gasp till they were overwhelmed by their own folly and by that envy which was only the blinded child of unbounded avarice and ambition as i shall show presently  the fall of your machine i have touched at already the author of the letter seems not at all to see the nature of it and is quite wide of the occasion and hinting only at the instruments as if they were scarce known in which by the way he is also mistaken places it to the account of a mere trifle namely that the first adventurers began to think of realizing their stock and converting the prodigious gains they had made into specie and this says he brought such a demand upon the bank as it was impossible to answer  how poor and mean a description is here of the most flagrant cheat in the world and which was just then offered in the face of the sun the like of which was enough to alarm all the world the meaning of it all was in short nothing more or less than this that the great men who were first in this monstrous adventure of yours and who had as you say come in at  0 per cent under par and stood now at  000 per cent above par knowing very well that it was as above impossible to be supported but must at last fall all to pieces and come to nothing began to think it high time to be satisfied and sell out vesting their vast stocks in the bank and from thence as you say drawing such great sums in specie that it was impossible the bank or even the whole kingdom should answer them  this was indeed done with less art than in england it was immediately seen in the rue de quincampoix that the great men and particularly the first projectors began to sell out their stock and buy estates nay the great mr law on whose example so much depended was not so politic in this part as sir john blant but bought estates lordships palaces nay as i have heard even roy alties and principalities i hope no man will place that part among his prudentials or as a testimony of his most accomplished genius if mr law did not foresee that his selling our and the other peoples selling out who were looked upon to be in the main secret of the affair would at least he an example to others to do the like and that the alarm once taken it would soon bring more sellers to market than buyers the consequence of which must be a fall of the price which would be fatal as death i say if he did not foresee this he could not be the great man the world at that time esteemed him to be and if he did foresee it and yet openly acted so he must be supposed to see himself at the end of the adventure and like a skilful pilot who seeing first the unavoidable wreck of the ship he is in makes provision for his own safety and takes care to get something too out of the cargo for himself but neither of these suppositions give us any idea of mr law to his advantage whether we speak of his capacity or of his integrity  come we then to the circumstances which overthrew our south sea fabric here which are in proportion the same that which gave them the first blow was likewise a trifle and from which even the longest head among them did not expect the consequence that happened nay it was seen without doors before it was seen within if we may believe some who were witnesses to the surprise it was even to those who struck the blow when they found the wound was felt where it was not intended the case was this  avarice an unwearied and impatient vice finding the scheme on which her great advantages were built rivaled as it was then called by petty bubbles of rising fame and not brooking any such thing as to see part of the gain going besides her mill grown insolent by her success and grasping the whole world in her imagination she grew also uneasy at their success and though she soared infinitely above them all ought to have disdained them or that being her self a bubble she ought to have encouraged the universal humor of bubbling i say avarice impatient thus to be mated or so much as rivaled stirred up her old ancestor envy to fall upon them and in a word to make use of her friends to suppress all the other bubbles of the town  in consequence of this project came out a publication and process was ordered to be issued out by writ of scire facias against several of the projects that were then on foot such as yorkbuildings british copper welsh copper lustring and others and the two companies since called the royal exchange and the london assurances were threatened with the same  but the influence of this design run quite counter to what was intended and things began presently to take another turn for as this immediately struck a mortal blow upon the stocks of all those companies which were already very high and that a prodigious number of contracts were made for their stock and afterward became void by their never being able to open their books the people were immediately obliged to sell off their south sea stock to support their credit which had received such a blow in these bubbles  but it did not end here for    this brought such a prodigious quantity of stock to market that it was impossible buyers should be found to take it off which as it always is when there are more sellers than buyers made stock immediately fall and which was still worse    it checked the adventurous humor of the people gave them a shock made them sick of bubbles in general and made them suggest that the south sea it self being by the extravagant greatness become a bubble also might some time or other meet with a like shock and thus withdrawing universally from every thing the catastrophe began and has ever since gone on to what we see it is at present  all this while as was afterward discovered the great men who were in the secret who knew that one time or other it must all blow up were like your great men in france realizing their stock that is to say turning it into specie and buying estates with it for which they gave most extravagant rates such as the sellers almost blushed to ask for them paying for them as much as possibly they could in south sea stock so to cover the transferring such large sums of stock the better  now all the difference between mr law and the great men in france and the directors in england was that he did it openly and unwarily and thereby gave the alarm which overthrew their whole scheme but our people did it subtily and privately and that our alarm coming another way as above they were not found out till afterward  and thus i have run a parallel between the two schemes and the management on either side as far as it concerns mr law in which i think i do mr law no injury if i say that the letter writer has made a wide deviation from his true character and that though his genius was really very much bent upon figures and calculations and that he had at first just notions of credit and cash and of forming projections for the carrying those undertakings which related to a bank yet he was bold enterprizing rash and adventurous beyond the reach of the plan on which he proposed to act that he attempted impracticable things and supported them by launching into more things equally impracticable so that there was a necessity for him at last to sink as i have said in the ruins of his own design that finding this necessity approaching and inevitable he sold out and amassed an infinite treasure in specie part of which he remitted that is conveyed out of the kingdom and with other parts of which he purchased palaces estates honors and lands without number and when in the consequence of this the people began to be alarmed and did the like and that the bank stopped the stock sunk and all fell into confusion he got leave to run away to avoid the just resentment of a ruined nation  and now sir i appeal to your self whether this is not a fairer account of the fact and a truer history of mr law than what the letter has undertaken or than what he has introduced as from paris and that though you are not flattered no injury is done you in it nor any hurt intended you  it remains now to enquire here with the same plainness into what the writer of the letter would only suggest whether maliciously or not i will not determine namely that mr law being arrived here all these things may be the consequence of his coming hither which ought to be written down in the four lines which he has left blank in his letter intimating if we please to take it so for he leaves every one to take it as he will that mr law may be employed on great designs here among us whether to good or hurt he would likewise leave us to conjecture  this i must needs say i think is doing you a great deal of injury and exposing you to very great hardships and resentments one way or other as people may be prompted by their fears or hopes to suggest  now in this sir i may perhaps do you an unexpected piece of justice and am not out of hopes of meriting much of your favor by it at least i will undertake to deliver mr law from all the prejudices and jealousies which seem to be rising against him among us and this you will be further satisfied of in the reading these sheets wherein if i effectually make it appear that all that is suggested of mr law as to what he may do here is groundless and that it is impossible that he should ever be able to do either good for us or hurt to us i shall tout de une coup remove all the jealousies and ill will that i see some people begin to entertain of him and though it may be suggested that then i shall vote him useless which they say is indeed making him a mere invalid and bespeaking a cell for him at chelsea or at greenwich yet i say i shall make him full amends by delivering him from the clamours of the people and stoping the mouths of these speechmaking enemies which he might otherwise find very troublesome to him on all occasions making his native country a true assylum to him as it is to a great many harmless worthless gentlemen beside  nor is there here any need to enter into arguments from your good character and the general principle which your friends say you have acted by and so endeavor to prove that you will do us no harm since i have that more solid argument to make use of namely the reputation of your sense your understanding and penetration for having once laid it down as a fundamental and proved it past contradiction that it is impossible you should do either good or hurt to us i leave your character of a man of sense and judgment to vouch for you that you will not attempt it and it would be the greatest satyr imaginable upon mr law and an affront which my regard for him will not suffer me to offer him to insinuate that he will venture to embark in any thing which his understanding must tell him is impossible we are a nation credulous enough and have been censured for our folly in the conduct of our private affairs by all the wiser people of europe and our late south sea follies give but too much reason for us to acknowledge that the reproach is just and had the great mr law acted in the place of the less politic mr knight or the still less able mr c  g i know not to what farther extremes we might have run  i acknowledge that in the height of our jobbing madness many people as amazed and surpised would frequently start a little and offer the idle question where will all these things end but there was not a man that did or perhaps durst boldly take pen and ink and show by just calculations where they must end and what destruction attended them and of which it might have even then been said they were not only possible to be the consequences but that it was impossible to be otherwise i say no body durst be so free and honest for he was sure to be run down by the popular rage of the day on one hand and checked perhaps insulted by power on the other hand nor do i say thus much without good reasons  but had any of those wise men who like prophets that prophecy after a thing is come to pass have since shown us how impossible it was those things should end otherwise than they did had zeal enough for their countrys good and to have adventured to say as much and with as clear demonstrations of it beforehand as they did afterward however they might have been treated then they would have obtained a double share of reputation now as well for their honesty as their penetration  but we must take things as they are and as nature presents them to us fate and our national precipitations determined us at that time to be a prey to our deluders and which is worse to be the fools of fools for really the managers however by the insatuation of the times they prevailed to impose upon us to such a degree yet it must be acknowledged used no great cunning in deceiving us the baits were laid so superficially and the hook appeared so open that had we not been blinded by a voracious avarice it had been impossible to have brought a whole nation to be plundered as they were even running into the pit with their eyes open  it is reported that a certain fish which we deal much in abroad is so eager for the prey that if a hook be but covered with a bit of red cloth instead of flesh they swallow it all at once and are taken without any bait at all we were indeed taken in those days without a bait we were a temptation to our selves our own avarice led us on and we came to the south sea house so eager to be undone that there was no need to lay traps and plots to deceive us  the use i make of this for i am not entering into the history of it is not to show how mad we were then but to show how sensible we are of it now and to let you see sir that the train being now fired and blown up there is no need to fear we shall a second time be drawn in that we can no more be bubbleriden that we shall not bite at a red rag now and if all the men of figures and men of art in europe were to angle for us they would catch no more guageons here the season is over the moonblind people are effectually cured the frenzy is abated not the sharpest jobber of the town can reach us or overreach us now no not the great mr law if he thinks he can he may go to work when he pleases but he will soon see his engines will not work the season for national delusion is over he may as well raise a harvest in winter as raise the adventurous temper again among the people after the shocks and damps to their courage which they have lately received as the adventuring temper of the people is checked and the edge of their courage that way taken off so mr law must give me leave to say and lay a great stress upon it too that the tools to work with on such occasions i mean money and credit  mr law was certainly right in his postulata which the letter to him says to his praise p    were the principles which he went upon in his great undertaking namely that trade depended on money that credit was equal to money that the credit of the royal bank supported by the whole species of all and formed into one great trading company had infinite advantage over credit in the hands of private traders that consequently such credit might be extended much farther than private personal credit that paper might supply the place of silver and was even better qualified to be used as money   i say these are all solid and undoubted axioms in the affairs of trade or revenues funds national treasure and such like things and are worthy of the genius of the great mr law when acting in france where credit never showed much of her face before though here with your pardon these things are common topics that every stockjobber is master of  but what is all this to be talked of now and i wonder that the letter writer could mention them after what he had said p   of the deplorable condition of our native country see his words  you will find our trade lost our credit ruined our money in the hands of the basest men among us and the innocent and deluded still groaning under the oppressions of the wicked and insatiable   now sir after this is it not a most preposterous thing an absurdity and merits ridicule to the highest degree to hear the same writer talk of any danger from mr law what can be more inconsistent mr law indeed laid down the great and undoubted particulars above as complete propositions and he was right and upon these he founded all the great things he did in france for example he set up a bank amassed money and erected credit on these three what might he not do and much greater things he might have done if his genius which this man extols so much had been equal to his undertaking  but what is this to his setting his wheels to work among us who this man says have neither trade money or credit if the best engineer or millwright in the nation were to build a watermill and make it a most beautiful complete piece of work that ever was seen yet if he has no water to drive it it is a thing without life useless and fit for nothing for mr law to set his wit to work upon a scheme of credit may be a fine thing and i am ready to do mr law justice with my utmost skill but what can this do among us whose credit is ruined do gamesters invite people to play that have no bank or do merchants invite men to buy that have no credit  again as we have no credit so we have no money and what have we to fear being cheated of who have nothing to lose  contabit vacuus coram latrone viator if we had a flowing cash and a high credit we might indeed be jealous of a man samd for an extraordinary genius which i take to be only fine words for something else and a mannerly way of calling a gentleman a bite and a sharper which i shall not imitate i say mr law may be all that this gentleman says of him though i shall not say i believe it of him but if mr law was sharper than he and forty more as cunning as himself they could never raise a project to the hurt of those people who have neither money or credit  if mr law will set up the finest project in the world upon a foundation of nothing we will come all into it and bring nothing to his nothing and let him see what he will make of us there can be no danger on our side  i remember an old verse of a gentleman who having lost what he had at play listed himself for a soldier and his friends persuading him against it and telling him of the danger he wrote this to them in answer what cares he to die sir that cannot tell how to live  i turn the case to the point in hand projects are a game let mr law set up as many as he pleases we may all come into them for what care they to game sir who nothing have to lose this is argued upon the authors own hypothesis namely that our trade is lost our money gone our credit ruined if this be true what can mr law make of us what can he get by us so we may effectually clear him of having any design upon those of whom nothing is to be gotten  but least it should be suggested that this is only catching at the advantage given in argument but has no solid weight in it for that the assumption may be denied and it is apparent we have both trade and money and credit though not much of the latter  to come then to the other side of the proposition and prove that as he will not attempt us because nothing is to be got by us so he cannot hurt us if he should attempt it because our eyes are now open we are the burnt children who shall always dread the fire we have been bit once and it was our masters the     and our masters the      and our masters the      s fault but if we are bit again it will be our own faults and no bodys else and on this account only i am far from being of their opinion and would have none be jealous of mr law i say let mr law go to work and if he has not spent all his ammunition in france and exported all his policy and exhausted his calculating genius there let him try his hand among us let him go to work with us and see what he can make of it and welcome i say that what between those who have no money to lose and those who having lost so much are made too cunning to lose any more we have nothing to fear from mr law  in the next place and to conclude all here are no materials for mr law to work with here are no more funds to bring in as there are no more fools to subscribe them so there are no things for them to subscribe  it is true that our credit has suffered a blow a deep wound though i hope not a mortal wound on the other hand it is not to be revived by any project i say not by any the whole world cannot restore credit in england to what it has been but by the assistance of the one article called time which does not consist with any companys declas either mr law or any man in the world can bring forth  our credit has been lost by knavery by tricking and false dealing and nothing but the reverse of the chicane which is honesty can restore it and this honesty must be approved to be the prevailing general practice of the age as the other has been before it can introduce credit honesty and credit went away together and they must come together or not at all the allusion will be found to be just and the consequence is plain that till by length of time we recover our honesty of dealing we shall never fully restore our credit and till credit is restored there is no foundation for a man of genius to build upon to do us or himself any good and i take mr law to be too wise a man to pretend to form any new undertaking here as both we and himself are now circumstancd in the world  i might have mentioned here that the particular jealousy people have of mr law upon account of the late undertaking in france and that little credit he has obtained for integrity in his part is another obstruction to his making any attempt and especially seeing the letter wrote to compliment him so much and perhaps to prepare us to think better of him has so ill come off in his panegyric and endeavoring to prove him the great genius that he would have him be thought to be he has neither cleared him as an honest man or as a wise man i could explain my self to mr laws disadvantage but i forbear till further occasion may be given which however i foresee will not be long  i am sir your humble servant  finis
