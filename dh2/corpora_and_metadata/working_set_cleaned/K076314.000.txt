good an elephant before him lay that much encumbered had the way the messenger who is still in haste would fain have bowed and so have past when up arose the unweildy brute and would repeat a late dispute in which he said he would gained the prize from a wild boar of monstrous size but fame quoth he with all her tongues who lawyers ladies soldiers wrongs has to my disadvantage told an action thoroughly bright and bold has said that i foul play had used and with my weight the opposer bruised had laid my trunk about his brawn before his tushes could be drawn had stunned him with a hideous roar and twentythousand scandals more but i defy the talk of men or voice of brutes in every den the impartial skies are all my care and how it stands recorded there amongst you gods pray what is thought quoth mercury  then have you fought solicitous thus should i be for what is said of my verse and me or should my friends excuses frame and beg the critics not to blame since from a female hand it came defects in judgment or in wit they would but reply  then has she writ our vanity we more betray in asking what the world will say than if in trivial things like these we wait on the event with ease nor make long prefaces to show what men are not concerned to know for still untouched how we succeed it is for themselves not us they read whilst that proceeding to requite we own who in the muse delight it is for our selves not them we write betrayed by solitude to try amusements which the prosperous fly and only to the press repair to six our scattered papers there though whilst our labors are preserved the printers may indeed be starved all is vanity i how vain is life which rightly we compare to flying posts that haste away to plants that fade with the declining day to clouds that sail amidst the yielding air till by extention into that they flow or scattering on the world below are lost and gone ere we can say they were to autumnleaves which every wind can chase to rising bubbles on the waters face to fleeting dreams that will not stay nor in the abused fancy dance when the returning rays of light resuming their alternate right break on the illorderd scene on the fantastic trance as weak is man whilst tenant to the earth as frail and as uncertain all his ways from the first moment of his weeping birth down to the last and best of his few restless days when to the land of darkness he retires from disappointed hopes and frustrated desires reaping no other fruit of all his pain bestowed whilst in the vale of tears below but this unhappy truth at last to know that vanitys our lot and all mankind is vain ii if past the hazard of his tendrest years neither in thoughtless sleep oppressed nor poisoned with a tainted breast loosed from the infant bands and female cares a studious boy advanced beyond his age wastes the dim lamp and turns the restless page for some loved book prevents the rising day and on it stolen aside bestows the hours of play him the observing master does design for search of darkened truths and mysteries divine bids him with unremitted labor trace the rise of empires and their various fates the several tyrants over the several states to babels lofty towers and warlike nimrods race bids him in paradise the bank survey where man newmoulded from the tempered clay till fired with breath divine a helpless figure lay could he be led thus far  what were the boast what the reward of all the toil it cost what from that land of everblooming spring for our instruction could he bring unless that having humane nature found unseparated from its parent ground however we vaunt our elevated birth the epicure in soft array the loathsome beggar that before his rude unhospitable door unpitied but by brutes a broken carcass lay were both alike derived from the same common earth but ere the child can to these heights attain ere he can in the learned sphere arise a guiding star attracting to the skies a fever seizing the oerlabourd brain sends him perhaps to deaths concealing shade where in the marble tomb now silent laid he better does that useful doctrine show which all the sad assistants ought to know who round the grave his short continuance mourn that first from dust we came and must to dust return iii a bolder youth grown capable of arms bellona courts with her prevailing charms bids the enchanting trumpet sound loud as triumph soft as love striking now the poles above then descending from the skies soften every falling note as the harmonious lark that sings and flies when near the earth contracts her narrow throat and warbles on the ground shows the proud steed impatient of the check against the loudest terrors proof pawing the valley with his steeled hoof with lightning armed his eyes with thunder clothed his neck who on the advanced foe the signal given flies like a rushing storm by mighty whirlwinds driven lays open the records of fame no glorious deed omits no man of mighty name their stratagems their tempers she will repeat from alexanders truly styled the great from caesars on the worlds imperial seat to turennes conduct and to condes heat it is done and now the ambitious youth disdains the safe but harder labors of the gown the softer pleasures of the courtly town the once loved rural sports and chaces on the plains does with the soldiers life the garb assume the gold embroidries and the graceful plume walks haughty in a coat of scarlet die a color well contrived to cheat the eye where richer blood alas may undistinguisht lie and oh too near that wretched fate attends hear it ye parents all ye weeping friends thou fonder maid won by those gaudy charms the destined prize of his victorious arms now sainting dye upon the mournful sound that speaks his hasty death and paints the fatal wound trail all your pikes dispirit every drum march in a slow procession from afar ye silent ye dejected men of war be still the hautboys and the flute be dumb display no more in vain the lofty banner for see where on the bier before ye lies the pale the fallen the untimely sacrifice to your mistaken shrine to your false idol honor iv as vain is beauty and as short her power though in its proud and transitory sway the coldest hearts and wisest heads obey that gay fantastic tyrant of an hour on beautys charms although a fathers right though grave seleucus to thy royal side by holy vows fair stratonice be tied with anxious joy with dangerous delight too often gazes thy unwary son till past all hopes expiring and undone a speaking pulse the secret cause impart

strand a cleopatras coming down the cydnus exactly agreeing with the description of it in plutarch queen at his tribunal to be tried a queen that armed in beauty shall deride his feeble rage and his whole fate command over the still waves her burnisht galley moves rowed by the graces whilst officious loves to silken cords their busy hands apply or gathering all the gentle gales that fly to their fair mistress with those spoils repair and from their purple wings disperse the balmy air hovering perfumes ascend in odorous clouds curl over the barque and play among the shrouds whilst gently dashing every silver oar guided by the rules of art with tuneful instruments designed to soften and subdue the stubborn mind a strangely pleasing and harmonious part in equal measures bore like a new venus on her native sea in midst of the transporting scene which pen or pencil imitates in vain on a resplendent and conspicuous bed with all the pride of persia loosely spread the lovely syrene lay which but discerned from the yet distant shore the amazed emperor could hate no more no more a baffled vengeance could pursue but yielding still still as she nearer drew when cleopatra anchored in the bay where every charm could all its force display like his own statue stood and gazed the world away where ends alas this pageantry and state where end the triumphs of this conquering face envied of roman wives and all the female race oh swift vicissitude of beautys fate now in her tomb withdrawn from public sight from near captivity and shame the vanquished the abandoned dame proffers the arm that held anothers right to the destructive snakes more just embrace and courts deforming death to mend his leaden pace v but wit shall last the vaunting poet cries the immortal streams that from parnassus flow shall make his neverfading laurels grow above this mouldring earth to flourish in the skies  and the two lines with these marks  before them are thus translated by ben johnson from ovid when his body falls in funeral fire when late revolving ages shall consume the very pillars that support his tomb  his name shall live and his best part aspire deluded wretch grasping at future praise now planting with mistaken care round thy enchanted palace in the air a grove which in thy fancy time shall raise a grove of soaring palms and everlasting bays could thou alas to such renown arrive as thy imaginations would contrive should numerous cities in a vain contest struggle for thy famous birth should the sole monarch of the conquered earth his wreathed head upon thy volume rest like maro could thou justly claim amongst the inspired tuneful race the highest room the undisputed place and after near two thousand years of fame have thy proud work to a new people shown the unequaled poems made their own in such a dress in such a perfect style as on his labors dryden now bestows as now from drydens just improvement flows in every polished verse throughout the british isle what benefit alas would to thee grow what sense of pleasure would thou know what swelling joy what pride what glory have when in the darkness of the abject grave insensible and stupid laid below no atom of thy heap no dust would move for all the airy breath that formed thy praise above vi true says the man to luxury inclined without the study of uncertain art without much labor of the mind mere uninstructed nature will impart that life too swiftly flies and leaves all good behind sieze then my friends he cries the present hour the pleasure which to that belongs the feasts the overflowing bowls the mirth the songs the orangebloom that with such sweetness blows anacreons celebrated rose the hyacinth with every beauteous flower which just this happy moment shall disclose are out of fortunes reach and all within our power such costly in the life of demetrius in plutarch there is a description of a garment ordered to be made for him wherein was expressed in precious stones and other costly materials the elements as here described garments let our slaves prepare as for the gay demetrius were designed where a new sun of radiant diamonds shined where the enameled earth and scarcediscerned air with a transparent sea were seen a sea composed of the emralds green and with a golden shore encompassed round where every orient shell of wondrous shape was found the whole creation on his shoulders hung the whole creation with his wish complied did swiftly for each appetite provide and fed them all when young no less the sardanapalus assyrian prince enjoyed of bliss too soon deprived but never cloyed whose counsel let us still pursue whose monument did this inscription show to every passenger that trod the way where with a slighting in sardanapaluss statue upon his monument as described by several authors and upon medals his right hand is held up with his fingers in a posture as giving a filip to the world hand and scornful smile the proud essigies on the instructive pile a great example lay i here entombed did mighty kingdoms sway two cities raised anchialus and tarsus in one prodigious day thou wandering traveller no longer gaze no longer dwell upon this useless place go feed and drink in sports consume thy life for all that else we gains not worth a moments strife thus talks the fool whom no restraint can bound when now the glass has gone a frequent round when soaring fancy lightly swims fancy that keeps above and dances over the brims whilst weighty reason sinks and in the bottoms drowned adds to his own an artificial fire doubling every hot desire till the auxiliary spirits in a flame the stomachs magazine defy that standing pool that helpless moisture nigh through every vital part impetuous fly and quite consume the frame when to the under world despised he goes a pampered carcass on the worms bestows who rioting on the unusual cheer as good a life enjoy as he could boast of here vii but hold my muse thy farther flight restrain exhaust not thy declining force nor in a long pursued and breathless course attempt with slackened speed to run through every vanity beneath the sun lest thy oerwearyd reader should complain that of all vanities beside which thine or his experience ever have tried thou art too tedious muse most frivolous and vain yet tell the man of an aspiring thought of an ambitious restless mind that can no ease no satisfaction find till neighboring states are to subjection brought till universal awe enslaved mankind is taught that should he lead an army to the field for whose still necessary use the extended earth could not enough produce nor rivers to their thirst a full contentment yield yet must their dark reverse of fate roll round within that course of years within the short the swift and fleeting date prescribed by xerxes xerxes reviewing his most numerous army wept upon the reflection that within  00 years not one of them would be left alive when his falling tears bewailed those numbers which his sword employed and false hyenalike lamented and destroyed tell him that does some stately building raise a windsor or versailles erect and thorough all posterity expect with its unshaken base a firm unshaken praise tell him judeas temple is no more upon whose splendor thousands heretofore spent the astonished hours forgetful to adore tell him into the earth again is hurled that most stupendous wonder of the world justly presiding over the boasted seven by humane art and industry designed this the rich draught of the immortal mind the architect of heaven remember then to fix thy aim on high project and build on the other side the sky for after all thy vain expense below thou can no fame no lasting pleasure know no good that shall not thy embraces fly or thou from that be in a moment caught thy spirit to new claims new interests brought whilst unconcerned thy secret ashes lie or stray about the globe o man ordained to dye the prevalence of custom a female to a drunkard married when all her other arts miscarried had yet one stratagem to prove him and from good fellowship remove him finding him overcome with tipple and weak as infant at the nipple she to a vault transports the lumber and there expects his breaking slumber a table she with meat provided and robbed in black stood just beside it seen only by one glimring taper that blewly burnt through misty vapor at length he wakes his wine digested and of her phantomship requested to learn the name of that close dwelling and what offends his sight and smelling and of what land she was the creature with outspread hair and ghastly feature mortal quoth she to darkness hurried know that thou art both dead and buried conveyed last night from noisie tavern to this thy still and dreary cavern what strikes thy nose springs from the shatters of bodies killed with cordial waters stronger than other scents and quicker as urged by more spirituous liquor my self attend on the deceased when all their earthly trains released and in this place of endless quiet my business is to find them diet to show all sorts of meats and salades till i am acquainted with their palates but that once known then less suffices quoth he and on his crupper rises thou guardian of these lower regions thou providor for countless legions thou dark but charitable crony far kinder than my tisiphony who of our victuals thus art thinking if thou have care too of our drinking a bumper fetch quoth she a halter since nothing less thy tone can alter or break this habit thoust been getting to keep thy throat in constant wetting the mussulmans dream of the vizier and dervis where is that world to which the fancy flies when sleep excludes the present from our eyes whose map no voyager could ever design nor to description its wild parts confine yet such a land of dreams we must allow who nightly trace it though we know not how unfettered by the days obtruded rules we all enjoy that paradise of fools and find a sorrow in resuming sense which breaks some free delight and snatches us from thence thus in a dream a mussulman was shown a vizir whom he formerly had known when at the port he bore deputed sway and made the nations with a nod obey now all serene and splendid was his brow whilst ready waiters to his orders bow his residence an artful garden seemed adorned with all that pleasant he esteemed full of reward his glorious lot appeared as with the sight our dreamers mind was cheered but turning next he saw a dreadful sight which filled his soul with wonder and affright pursued by friends a wretched dervis sled through scorching plains which to wide distance spread whilst every torture gloomy poets paint was there prepared for the reputed saint amazed at this the sleeping turk enquires why he that lived above in soft attires now rolled in bliss while the other rolled in fires we are taught the sufferings of this future state the excess of courts is likeliest to create whilst solitary cells oergrown with shade the readiest way to paradise is made true quoth the phantom which he dreamed replied the lonely path is still the surest guide nor is it by these instances denied for know my friend whatever fame report the vizier to retirements would resort the ambitious dervis would frequent the court the shepherd piping to the fishes shepherd seeking with his lass to shun the heat of day was seated on the shadowed grass near which a flowing stream did pass and fish within it play to phillis he an angle gave and bid her toss the line for sure quoth he each fish must have who does not seek to be thy slave a harder heart than mine assemble here you watery race transportedly he cries and if when you behold her face you ever desire to quit the place you see not with my eyes but you perhaps are by the ear more easy to be caught if so i have my bagpipe here the only music that is not dear nor in great cities bought so sprightly was the tune he chose and often did repeat that phillis though not up she rose kept time with every thrilling close and jiggd upon her seat but not a fish would nearer draw no harmony or charms their frozen blood it seems could thaw nor all they heard nor all they saw could woo them to such terms the angry shepherd in a pett gives over his wheedling arts and from his shoulder throws the net resolved he would a supper get by force if not by parts thus stated laws are always best to rule the vulgar throng who grow more stubborn when carest or with soft rhetoric addressed if taking measures wrong love death and reputation reputation love and death the last all bones the first all breath the amidst composed of restless fire from each other would retire through the world resolved to stray every one a several way exercising as they went each such power as fate had lent which if it united were wretched mortals could not bear but as parting friends do show to what place they mean to go correspondence to engage nominate their utmost stage death declared he would be found near the fatal trumpets sound or where pestilences reign and quacks the greater plagues maintain shaking still his sandy glass and mowing human flesh like grass love as next his leave he took cast on both so sweet a look as their tempers near disarmed one relaxed and the other warmed shades for his retreat he chose rural plains and soft repose where no dowry ever was paid where no jointure ever was made no ill tongue the nymph perplexed where no forms the shepherd vexed where himself should be the care of the fond and of the fair where that was they soon should know au revoir then turned to go reputation made a pause suiting her severer laws second thoughts and third she used weighing consequences mused when at length to both she cried you two safely may divide to the antipodes may fall and reascend the encompast ball certain still to meet again in the breasts of tortured men who by one too far betrayed call in the other to their aid whilst i tender coy and nice raised and ruined in a trice either six with those i grace or abandoning the place no return my nature bears from green youth or hoary hairs if through guilt or chance i sever i once parting part for ever there is no tomorrow a fable imitated from sir roger lestrange two long had loved and now the nymph desired the cloak of wedlock as the case required urged that the day he wrought her to this sorrow he vowed that he would marry her tomorrow again he swears to shun the present storm that he tomorrow will that vow perform the morrows in their due successions came impatient still on each the pregnant dame urged him to keep his word and still he swore the same when tired at length and meaning no redress but yet the lie not caring to confess he for his oath this salvo chose to borrow that he was free since there was no tomorrow for when it comes in place to be employed it is then today tomorrows never enjoyed the tales a jest the moral is a truth tomorrow and tomorrow cheat our youth in riper age tomorrow still we cry not thinking that the present day we dye vnpractisd all the good we had designed there is no tomorrow to a willing mind the petition for an absolute retreat inscribed to the right honble catharine countess of thanet mentiond in the poem under the name of arminda give me o indulgent fate give me yet before i dye a sweet but absolute retreat amongst paths so lost and trees so high that the world may never invade through such windings and such shade my unshaken liberty no intruders thither come who visit but to be from home none who their vain moments pass only studious of their glass news that charm to listening ears that false alarm to hopes and fears that common theme for every fop from the statesman to the shop in those coverts never be spread of who is deceased or who is to wed be no tidings thither brought but silent as a midnight thought where the world may never invade be those windings and that shade courteous fate afford me there a table spread without my care with what the neighboring fields impart whose cleanliness be all it is art when of old the calf was dressed though to make an angels feast in the plain unstudied sauce nor treufle nor morillia was nor could the mighty patriarchs board one farfetched ortolane afford courteous fate then give me there only plain and wholesome fare fruits indeed would heaven bestow all that did in eden grow all but the forbidden tree would be coveted by me grapes with juice so crowded up as breaking through the native cup figs yet growing candyd over by the suns attracting power cherries with the downy peach all within my easy reach whilst creeping near the humble ground should the strawberry be found springing wheresoeer i strayed through those windings and that shade for my garments let them be what may with the time agree warm when phoebus does retire and is illsupplyd by fire but when he renews the year and verdant all the fields appear beauty every thing resumes birds have dropped their winterplumes when the lilly full displayed stands in purer white arrayed than that vest which heretofore the luxurious josephus says that every monday solomon went to the house of lebanon in an open chariot clothed in a robe most dazzling white which makes that allusion not improper and may give us grounds to believe that the lilly mentioned by our savior compared to solomon in his glory might really be the common white lilly although the commentators seem in doubt what flowers are truly meant by the lillies as thinking the plain lilly not gay enough for the comparison whereas this garment is noted by josephus to be wonderfully beautiful though only white nor can any flower i believe have a greater luster than the common white lilly monarch wore when from salems gates he drove to the soft retreat of love lebanons all burnished house and the dear egyptian spouse cloth me fate though not so gay cloth me light and fresh as may in the fountains let me view all my habit cheap and new such as when sweet zephyrs fly with their motions may comply gently waving to express unaffected carelessness no perfumes have there a part borrowed from the chemists art but such as rise from flowery beds or the falling jasmin sheds twas the odor of the field esaus rural coat did yield that inspired his fathers prayer for blessings of the earth and air of gums or pouders had it smelt the supplanter then unfelt easily had been descried for one that did in tents abide for some beauteous handmaids joy and his mothers darling boy let me then no fragrance wear but what the winds from gardens bear in such kind surprising gales as gathered from these circumstances are related by plutarch in the life of sylla fidentias vales all the flowers that in them grew which intermixing as they flew in wreathen garlands dropped again on lucullus and his men who cheered by the victorious sight trebld numbers put to flight let me when i must be fine in such natural colors shine wove and painted by the sun whose resplendent rays to shun when they do too fiercely beat let me find some close retreat where they have no passage made through those windings and that shade give me there since heaven has shown it was not good to be alone a partner suited to my mind solitary pleased and kind who partially may something see preferred to all the world in me slighting by my humble side fame and splendour wealth and pride when but two the earth possessed twas their happiest days and best they by business nor by wars they by no domestic cares from each other ever were drawn but in some grove or flowery lawn spent the swiftly flying time spent their own and natures prime in love that only passion given to perfect man whilst friends with heaven rage and jealousy and hate transports of his fallen state when by satans wiles betrayed fly those windings and that shade thus from crowds and noise removed let each moment be improved every object still produce thoughts of pleasure and of use when some river slides away to increase the boundless sea think we then how time does haste to grow eternity at last by the willows on the banks gathered into social ranks playing with the gentle winds strait the boughs and smooth the rinds moist each fiber and each top wearing a luxurious crop let the time of youth be shown the time alas too soon outgrown whilst a lonely stubborn oak which no breezes can provoke no less gusts persuade to move than those which in a whirlwind drove spoiled the old fraternal feast and left alive but one poor guest rivelld the distorted trunk sapless limbs all bent and shrunk sadly does the time presage of our too near approaching age when a helpless vine is found unsupported on the ground careless all the branches spread subject to each haughty tread bearing neither leaves nor fruit living only in the root back reflecting let me say so the sad ardelia lay blasted by a storm of fate felt through all the british state fallen neglected lost forgot dark oblivion all her lot faded till armindas love guided by the powers above warmed anew her drooping heart and life diffused through every part mixing words in wise discourse of such weight and wondrous force as could all her sorrows charm and transitory ills disarm chearing the delightful day when disposed to be more gay with wit from an unmeasured store to woman never allowed before what nature or refining art all that fortune could impart heaven did to arminda send then gave her for ardelias friend to her cares the cordial drop which else had overflowed the cup so when once the son of jess every anguish did oppress hunted by all kinds of ills like a partridge on the hills trains were laid to catch his life baited with a royal wife from his house and country torn made a heathen princes scorn fate to answer all these harms threw a friend into his arms friendship still has been designed the support of humankind the safe delight the useful bliss the next worlds happiness and this give then o indulgent fate give a friend in that retreat though withdrawn from all the rest still a clue to reach my breast let a friend be still conveyed through those windings and that shade where may i remain secure waste in humble joys and pure a life that can no envy yield want of affluence my shield thus had the description of this cave is exactly taken from plutarch in the life of crassus crassus been content when from marius rage he went with the seat that fortune gave the commodious ample cave formed in a divided rock by some mighty earthquakes shock into rooms of every size fair as art could ever devise leaving in the marble roof against all storms and tempests proof only passage for the light to refresh the cheerful sight whilst three sharers in his fate on the escape with joy dilate beds of moss their bodies bore canopyd with ivy over rising springs that round them played over the native pavement strayed when the hour arrived to dine various meats and sprightly wine on some neighboring cliff they spied every day anew supplied by a friends entrusted care had he still continued there made that lonely wondrous cave both his palace and his grave peace and rest he might have found peace and rest are under ground nor have been in that retreat famed for a proverbial fate in pursuit of wealth been caught and punished with a golden draught nor had sertorius he who crowds could blind whispering with a snowy hind made em think that from above like the great impostors dove tidings to his ears she brought rules by which he marched and fought after spain he had oerrun cities sacked and battles won drove romes consuls from the field made her darling pompey yield at a fatal treacherous feast felt a dagger in his breast had he his oncepleasing thought of solitude to practice brought had no wild ambition swayed in those islands had he stayed justly called the seats of rest truly the canary islands called by the ancients the fortunate islands and taken by some of the poets for elysium fortunate and blessed by the ancient poets given as their best discovered heaven let me then indulgent fate let me still in my retreat from all roving thoughts be freed or aims that may contention breed nor be my endeavors led by goods that perish with the dead fitly might the life of man be indeed esteemed a span if the present moment were of delight his only share if no other joys he knew than what round about him grew but as those who stars would trace from a subterranean place through some engine lift their eyes to the outward glorious skies so the immortal spirit may when descended to our clay from a rightly governed frame view the height from whence she came to her paradise be caught and things unutterable taught give me then in that retreat give me o indulgent fate for all pleasures left behind contemplations of the mind let the fair the gay the vain courtship and applause obtain let the ambitious rule the earth let the giddy fool have mirth give the epicure his dish every one their several wish whilst my transports i employ on that more extensive joy when all heaven shall be surveyed from those windings and that shade jupiter and the farmer when poets gave their god in crete a birth then jupiter held traffic with the earth and had a farm to let the fine was high for much the treasry wanted a supply by danaes wealthy shower exhausted quite and dry but mercry who as steward kept the court so racked the rent that all who made resort unsatisfied returned nor could agree to use the lands or pay his secret fee till one poor clown thought subtler than the rest through various projects rolling in his breast consents to take it if at his desire all weathers toward his harvest may conspire the frost to kill the worm the brooding snow the filling rains may come and phoebus glow the terms accepted signed and sealed the lease his neighbors grounds afford their due increase the care of heaven the owners cares may cease whilst the new tenant anxious in his mind now asks a shower now craves a rustling wind to raise what that had lodged that he the sheaves may bind the sun thoershadowing clouds the moistning dews he with such contrariety does choose so often and so oddly shifts the scene whilst others load he scarce has what to glean o jupiter with famine pinched he cries no more will i direct the unerring skies no more my substance on a project lay no more a sullen doubt i will betray let me but live to reap do thou appoint the way the decision of fortune a fable fortune wellpicturd on a rolling globe with waving locks and thin transparent robe a man beholding to his neighbor cried whoever would catch this dame must swiftly ride mark how she seems to fly and with her bears all that is worth a busy mortals cares the gilded air about her statue shines as if the earth had lent it all her mines at random here a diadem she slings and there a scarlet hat with dangling strings and to ten thousand fools ten thousand glorious things shall i then stay at home dull and content with quarterdays and hard extorted rent no i will to horse to sea to utmost isles but i will encounter her propitious smiles whilst you in slothful ease may choose to sleep and scarce the few paternal acres keep farewell replied his friend may you advance and grow the darling of this lady chance whilst i indeed not courting of her grace shall dwell content in this my native place hoping i still shall for your friend be known but if too big for such acquaintance grown i shall not be such a fond mistaken sot to think remembrance should become my lot when you exalted have your self forgot nor me ambitious ever shall you find or hunting fortune who they say is blind but if her want of sight should make her stray she should be welcome if she came this way it is very like the undertaker cried that she her steps to these lost paths should guide but i lose time whilst i such thoughts deride

makes it to his glass there in himself now seeks amends convinced that where a wit pretends a beau is but an ass the executor a greedy heir long waited to fulfill as his executor a kinsmans will and

his flattering wiles and softens the dispute with smiles but folly who no temper knows words pursues with hotter blows till the eyes of love were lost which has such pain to mortals cost venus hears

pursued and at what time the aguish fit renewed the waining wretch each day become more faint in like proportion doubles his complaint now swooning sweats he begs him to allay now give his lungs more liberty to play and take from emptied veins these scorching heats away or if he saw the danger did increase to warn him fair and let him part in peace my life for yours no hazard in your case the quack replies your voice your pulse your face good signs afford and what you seem to feel proceeds from vapors which well help with steel with kindled rage more than distemper burns the suffering man who thus in haste returns no more of vapors your beloved disease your ignorances skreen your whatyouplease with which you cheat poor females of their lives whilst men dispute not so it rid their wives for me i will speak free as i have paid my fees my flesh consumes i perish by degrees and as through weary nights i count my pains no rest is left me and no strength remains all for the better sir the quack rejoins exceeding promising are all these signs fallingaway your nurses can confirm was never in sickness thought a mark of harm the want of strength is for the better still since men of vigor fevers soonest kill even with this gust of passion i am pleased for they are most patient who the most are seized but let me see here is that which all repels then shakes as he some formal story tells the treaclewater mixed with powdered shells my stomachs gone what do you infer from thence nor will with the least sustenance dispense the better for where appetite endures meats intermingle and no medicine cures the stomach you must know sir is a part  but sure i feel deaths pangs about my heart nay then farewell i need no more attend the quack replies a sad approaching friend questions the sick why he retires so fast who says because of fees i have paid the last and whilst all symptoms toward my cure agree am for the better dying as you see verses written under the king of swedens picture observe this piece which to our sight does bring the fittest posture for the swedish king encompassed as we think with armies round though not expressed within this narrow bound who whilst his warlike and extended hand directs the foremost ranks to charge or stand reverts his face lest that so fair and young should call in doubt the orders of his tongue whilst the excited and emboldened

peer to whom she owes her being here in whom our britain lets us see what once they were and still should be as when the earliest race was drowned some patterns from amongst them found were kept to show succeeding times their excellence without their crimes more easily we might express what virtues do her mother dress what does her form and mind adorn of whom the engaging nymph was born what piety what generous love does the enlarged bosom move of the lady coventry her whose favorite she appears who more than as a niece endears such full perfections obvious lie and strike at first a poets eye deep lines of honor all can hit or mark out a superior wit consummate goodness all can show and where such graces shine below but the more tender strokes to trace to express the promise of a face when but the dawnings of the mind we from an air unripend find which altring as new moments rise the pen or pencils art defies when flesh and blood in youth appears polished like what our marble wears fresh as that shade of opening green which first upon our groves is seen enlivened by a harmless fire and brightened by each gay desire these nicer touches would demand a cowleys or a wallers hand to explain with undisputed art what it is affects the enlightened heart when every darker thought gives way whilst blooming beauty we survey to show how all that is soft and sweet does in the fair serena meet to tell us with a sure presage the charms of her maturer age when hothfeild shall as heretofore from its farsought and virtuous store it families of great renown did with illustrious hymens crown when hothfeild shall such treasure know as fair serena to bestow then should some muse of lotier wing the triumphs of that season sing describe the pains the hopes the fears of noble youths the

year   0  a wit transported with inditing unpayd unpraisd yet ever writing who for all fights and favorite friends had poems at his fingers ends for new events was still providing yet now desirous to be riding he packdup every ode and ditty and in vacation left the city so rapt with figures and allusions with secret passions sweet confusions with sentences from plays wellknown and thousand couplets of his own that even the chalky road looked gay and seemed to him the milky way but fortune who the ball is tossing and poets ever will be crossing misled the steed which ill he guided where several gloomy paths divided the steepest in descent he followed enclosed by rocks which time had hollowed till he believed alive and booted he would reached the shades by homer quoted but all that he could there discover was in a pit with thorns grown over old mammon digging straining sweating as bags of gold he thence was getting who when reproved for such dejections by him who lived on high reflections replied brave sir your time is ended and poetry no more befriended i hid this coin when charles was swaying when all was riot masking playing when witty beggars were in fashion and learning had oerrun the nation but since mankind is so much wiser that none is valued like the miser i draw it hence and now these sums in proper soil grow up to a plumb is a cant word signifying a hundred thousand pound plumbs which gathered once from that rich minute we rule the world and all that is in it but quoth the poet can you raise as well as plumbtrees groves of bays where you which i would choose much rather may fruits of reputation gather will men of quality and spirit regard you for intrinsic merit and seek you out before your betters for conversation wit and letters fool quoth the churl who knew no breeding have these been times for such proceeding instead of honored and rewarded are you not slighted or discarded what have you met with but disgraces your prior could not keep in places and your vanbrug had found no quarter but for his dabbling in the mortar row no advantages could hit on till verse he left to write northbriton philips who is by the shilling known

like the roman maroes no  quoth the man of broken slumbers yet we have patrons for our numbers there are mecaenass among em quoth mammon pray sir do not wrong em but in your censures use a conscience nor charge great men with thriftless nonsense since they as your own poets sing now grant no worth in any thing but so much money as twill bring then never more from your endeavors expect preferment or less favors but if you will scape contempt or worse be sure put money in your purse money which only can relieve you when fame and friendship will deceive you sir quoth the poet humbly bowing and all that he had said allowing behold me and my airy fancies subdued like giants in romances i here submit to your discourses which since experience too enforces i in that solitary pit your gold withdrawn will hide my wit till time which hastily advances and gives to all new turns and chances again may bring it into use roscommons may again produce new augustean days revive when wit shall please and poets thrive till when let those converse in private who taste what others dont arrive at yielding that mammonists surpass us and let the bank outswell parnassus the change poor river now you are almost dry what nymph or swain will near thee lie since brought alas to sad decay what flocks or herds will near thee stay the swans that sought thee in thy pride now on new streams forgetful ride and fish that in thy bosom lay choose in more prosperous floods to play all leave thee now thy ebb appears to waste thy sad remains in tears nor will thy mournful murmurs heed fly wretched stream with all thy speed amongst those solid rocks thy griefs bestow for friends like those alas thou never did know and thou poor sun that satst on high but late the splendor of the sky what flower though by thy influence born now clouds prevail will toward thee turn now darkness sits upon thy brow what persian votary will bow what river will her smiles reflect now that no beams thou can direct by watery vapors overcast who thinks upon thy glories past if present light nor heat we get unheeded thou may rise and set not all the past can one adorer keep fall wretched sun to the more faithful deep nor do thou lofty structure boast since undermined by time and frost since thou can no reception give in untrod meadows thou may live none from his ready road will turn with thee thy wretched change to mourn not the soft nights or cheerful days thou have bestowed can give thee praise no lusty tree that near thee grows though it beneath thy shelter rose will to thy age a staff become fail wretched building to thy tomb thou and thy painted roofs in ruin mixed fall to the earth for that alone is fixed the same poor man the same must be thy fate now fortune frowns on thee her favor every one pursues and losing her thou all must lose no love sown in thy prosperous days can fruit in this cold season raise no benefit by thee conferred can in this time of storms be heard all from thy troubled waters run thy stooping fabric all men shun all do thy clouded looks decline as if thou never did on them shine o wretched man to other worlds repair for faith and gratitude are only there enquiry after peace a fragment peace where art thou to be found where in all the spacious round may thy footsteps be pursued where may thy calm seats be viewed on some mountain do thou lie screnely near the ambient sky smiling at the clouds below where rough storms and tempests grow or in some retired plain undisturbed do thou remain where no angry whirlwinds pass where no floods oppress the grass high above or deep below fain i thy retreat would know fain i thee alone would find balm to my oerwearyd mind since what here the world enjoys or our passions most employs peace opposes or destroys pleasures a tumultuous thing busy still and still on wing flying swift from place to place darting from each beauteous face from each strongly mingled bowl through the inslamd and restless soul sovereign power who fondly craves but himself to pomp enslaves stands the envy of mankind peace in vain attempts to find thirst of wealth no quiet knows but near the deathbed siercer grows wounding

till you who make again repair the breach for when to shades of death our joys are fled when for a loss like this our tears are shed none can revive the heart but who can raise the dead but yet my muse if thou had softer verse than ever bewailed the melancholy hearse if thou had power to dissipate the gloom inherent to the solitary tomb to rescue thence the memory and air of what we lately saw so fresh so fair then should this noble youth thy art engage to show the beauties of his blooming age the pleasing light that from his eyes was cast like hasty beams too vigorous to last where the warm soul as one the confines lay ready for flight and for eternal day gently disposed his nature should be shown and all the mothers sweetness made his own the fathers likeness was but faintly seen as ripened fruits are figured by the green nor could we hope had he fulfilled his days he should have reached weymovths unequaled praise still one distinguished plant each lineage shows and all the rest beneath it is stature grows of tullys race but he possessed the tongue and none like julius from the caesars sprung next in his harmless sports he should be drawn urging his courser over the flowery lawn sprightly himself as the enlivened game bold in the chase and full of generous flame yet in the palace tractable and mild perfect in all the duties of a child which fond reflection pleases whilst it pains like penetrating notes of sad harmonious stra selected friendships timely he began and siezd in youth that best delight of man leaving a growing race to mourn his end their earliest and their ages promised friend but far away alas that prospect moves lost in the clouds like distant hills and  whilst with increasing steps we all pursue what time alone can bring to nearer view that future state which darkness yet invol known but by death which every doubt resol the critic and the writer of fable weary at last of the pindarick way through which adventrously the  would st to fable i descend with soft delight pleased to translate or easily endite whilst aerie fictions hastily repair to fill my page and rid my thoughts of care as they to birds and beasts new gifts impart and teach as poets should whilst they divert but here the critic bids me check this vein fable he cries though grown the affected strain but dies as it was born without regard or pain whilst of his aim the lazy trifler fails who seeks to purchase fame by childish tales then let my verse once more attempt the skies the easily persuaded poet cries since meaner works you men of taste despise the walls of troy shall be our loftier stage our mighty theme the fierce achilles rage the strength of hector and ulysses arts shall boast such language to adorn their parts as neither hobbes nor chapman could bestow or did from congreve or from dryden flow amidst her towers the dedicated horse shall be received big with destructive force till men shall say when flames have brou her do  troy

now ambition gains reasons lost throne and sovereign rule maintains though beyond loves ambitions empire goes for who feels love ambition also knows and proudly still aspires to be possessed of her he thinks superior to the rest as could be proved but that our plainer task does no such toil or definitions ask but to be so rehearsed as first twas told when such old stories pleased in days of old a king observing how a shepherds skill improved his flocks and did the pastures fill that equal careth assaulted did defend and the secured and grazing part attend approves the conduct and from sheep and curs transfers the sway and changed his wool to furrs lord keeper now as rightly he divides his just decrees and speedily decides when his sole neighbor whilst he watched the fold a hermit poor in

it true some ill that shall this seeming good ensue thousand distastes tallay thy envied gains unthought of on the parcimonious plains so proved the event and whisprers now defame the candid judge and his proceedings blame by wrongs they say a palace he crects the good oppresses and the bad protects to view this seat the king himself prepares where no magnificence or pomp appears but moderation free from each extreme whilst moderation is the builders theme ashamed yet still the sycophants persist that wealth he had concealed within a chest which but attended some convenient day to face the sun and brighter beams display the chest unbarrd no radiant gems they find no secret sums to foreign banks designed but humble marks of an obscure recess emblems of care and instruments of peace the hook the scrip and for unblamd delight the merry bagpipe which ere fall of night could sympathizing birds to tuneful notes invite welcome ye monuments of former joys welcome to bless again your masters eyes and draw from courts the instructed shepherd cries no more dear relics we no more will part you shall my hands employ who now revive my heart no emulations or corrupted times shall falsely blacken or seduce to crimes him whom your honest industry can please who on the barren down can sing from inward ease how is this the monarch something moved rejoins with such low thoughts and freedom from designs what made thee leave a life so fondly prized to be in crowds or envied or despised forgive me sir and humane frailty see the swain replies in my past state and me all peaceful that to which i vow return but who alas though mine at length i mourn was ever without the curse of some ambition born an epistle from a gentleman to madam deshouliers returning money she had lent him at bassette upon the first day of their acquaintance translated with liberty from the french urania whom the town admires whose wit and beauty share our praise this fair urania who inspires a thousand joys a thousand ways she who could with a glance convey favors that had my hopes outdone has lent me money on that day which our acquaintance first begun nor with the happiness i taste let any jealous doubts contend her friendship is secure to last beginning where all others end and thou known cheat upheld by law thou disappointer of the craving mind bassette who thy original do draw from venice by uncertain seas confined author of murmurs and of care of pleasing hopes concluding in despair to thee my strange felicity i owe from thy oppression did this succor flow less had i gained had thou propitious been who better by my loss have taught me how to win yet tell me my transported brain whose pride this benefit awakes know thou what on this chance depends and are we not exalted thus in vain whilst we observe the money which she lends but not alas the heart she takes the fond engagements and the ties her fatal bounty does impose who makes reprisals with her eyes for what her generous hand bestows and though i quickly can return those useful pieces which she gave can i again or would i have that which her charms have from me borne yet let us quit the obliging score and whilst we borrowed gold restore whilst readily we own the debt and gratitude before her set in its approved and fairest light let her effectually be taught by that instructive harmless slight that also in her turn she ought repaying every tender thought kindness with kindness to requite to edward jenkinson esquire a very young gentleman who writ a poem on peace fair youth who wish the wars may cease we own you better formed for peace nor pallas you nor mars should follow your gods are cupid and apollo who give sweet looks and early rhimes bespeaking joys and halcyon times your face which we as yet may praise calls for the myrtle and the bays the martial crowns fatigues demand and laurelld heroes must be tanned a fate we never can allow should reach your pleasing polished brow but granting what so young you have writ from nature flowed as well as wit and that indeed you peace pursue we must begin to treat with you we females sir it is i mean whilst i like bristol for the queen for all the ladies of your age as plenipo betimes engage and as first article declare you shall be faithful as youre fair no sighs when you shall know their use shall be discharged in loves abuse nor kindling words shall undermine till you in equal passion join nor money be alone your aim though you an overweight may claim and fairly build on your desert if with your person goes your heart but when this barrier i have gained and trust it will be well maintained who knows but some imprudent she betraying what is secured by me shall yield through verse or stronger charms to treat anew on easier terms and i be negligently told  you was too young and i too old to have our distant maxims hold to the painter of an illdrawn picture of cleone the honorable mrs thynne sooner i would praise a cloud which light beguiles than thy rash hand which robs this face of smiles and does that sweet and pleasing air control which to us paints the fair cleones soul it is vain to boast of rules or labored art i miss the look that captivates my heart attracts my love and tender thoughts inspires nor can my breast be warmed by common fires nor can ardelia love but where she first admires like jupiters thy head was sure in pain when this virago struggled in thy brain and strange it is thou have not made her wield a mortal dart or penetrating shield giving that hand of disproportioned size the power of which thou have disarmed her eyes as if like amazons she must oppose and into lovers force her vanquished foes had to theanor thus her form been shown to gain her heart he had not lost his own nor by the gentle bands of human life at once secured the mistress and the wife for still cleones beauties are the same and what first lightened still upholds his flame fain his compassion would thy works approve were pitying thee consistent with his love or with the taste which italy has wrought in his refined and daily heightened thought where poetry or painting find no place unless performed with a superior grace could but my wish some influence infuse never should the pencil or the sistermuse be tried by those who easily excuse but strictest censors should of either judge applaud the artist and despise the drudge then never would thy colors have debased cleones features and her charms defaced nor had my pen more subject to their laws assayed to vindicate her beautys cause a rigid fear had kept us both in awe nor i composed nor thou presumed to draw but in cleone viewing with surprise that excellence to which we never could rise by less attempts we safely might have gained that humble praise which neither has obtained since to thy shadowings or my ruder verse it is not given to show or to rehearse what nature in cleones face has writ a soft endearment and a cheerful wit that allsubduing that enlivening air by which a sympathizing joy we share for who forbears to smile when smiled on by the fair a pastoral dialogue between two shepherdesses silvia pretty nymph within this shade whilst the flocks to rest are laid whilst the world dissolves in heat take this cool and flowery seat and with pleasing talk a while let us two the time beguile though thou here no shepherd see to incline his humble knee or with melancholy lays sing thy dangerous beautys praise  dorinda nymph with thee i here would stay but have heard that on this day near those beeches scarce in view all the swains some mirth pursue to whose meeting now i haste solitude does life but waste  silvia prithee but a moment stay  dorinda no my chaplet would decay every drooping flower would mourn and wrong the face they should adorn  silvia i can tell thee though so fair and dressed with all that rural care most of the admiring swains will be absent from the plains gay sylvander in the dance meeting with a shrewd mischance to his cabins now confined by mopsus who the strain did bind damon through the woods does stray where his kids have lost their way young narcissus ivory brow racd by a malicious bough keeps the girilish boy from sight till time shall do his beauty right  dorinda where is alexis  silvia  he alas lies extended on the grass tears his garland raves despairs mirth and harmony forswears since he was this morning shown that delia must not be his own  dorinda foolish swain such love to place  silvia on any but dorindas face  dorinda hasty nymph i said not so  silvia no  but i thy meaning know every shepherd thou woudst have not thy lover but thy slave to increase thy captive train never to be loved again but since all are now away prithee but a moment stay  dorinda no the strangers from the vale sure will not this meeting fail graceful one the other fair he too with the pensive air told me ere he came this way he was wont to look more gay  silvia see how pride thy heart inclines to think for thee that shepherd pines when those words that reached thy ear chloe was designed to hear chloe who did near thee stand and his more speaking looks command  dorinda now thy envy makes me smile that indeed were worth his while chloe next thyself decayed and no more a courted maid  silvia next myself young nymph forbear still the swains allow me fair though not what i was that day when colon bore the prize away when   dorinda  oh hold that tale will last till all the evening sports are past till no streak of light is seen nor footstep prints the flowery green what thou were i need not know what i am must haste to show only this i now discern from the things thoudst have me learn that womankinds peculiar joys from past or present beauties rise  alcidor while monarchs in stern battle strove for proud imperial sway abandoned to his milder love within a silent peaceful grove alcidor careless lay some termed it cold unmanly fear some nicety of sense that drums and trumpets could not hear the sullying blasts of powder bear or with foul camps dispense a patient martyr to their scorn and each illfashiond jest the youth who but for love was born remained and thought it vast return to reign in clorias breast but oh a ruffling soldier came in all the pomp of war the gazettes long had spoke his fame now hautboys his approach proclaim and draw in crowds from far cloria unhappily would gaze and as he nearer drew the man of feather and of lace stopped short and with profound amaze took all her charms to view a bow which from campaigns he brought and to his holsters low herself and the spectators taught that her the fairest nymph he thought of all that formed the row next day ere phoebus could be seen or any gate unbarrd at hers upon the adjoining green from ranks with waving flags between were softened trumpets heard the noon does following treats provide in the pavilions shade the neighborhood and all beside that will attend the amorous pride are welcomed with the maid poor alcidor thy hopes are crossed go perish on the ground thy sighs by stronger notes are tossed drove back or in the passage lost rich wines thy tears have drowned in womens hearts the softest things which nature could devise are yet some harsh and jarring strings that when loud fame or profit rings will answer to the noise poor alcidor go fight or dye let thy fond notions cease man was not made in shades to lie or his full bliss at ease enjoy to live or love in peace some pieces out of the first act of the aminta of tasso daphnes answer to sylvia declaring she should esteem all as enemies who should talk to her of love then to the snowy ewe in thy esteem the father of the flock a foe must seem the faithful turtles to their yielding mates the cheerful spring which love and joy creates that reconciles the world by soft desires and tender thoughts in every breast inspires to you a hateful season must appear whilst love prevails and all are lovers here observe the gentle murmurs of that dove and see how billing she confirms her love for this the nightingale displays her throat and love love love is all her evening note the very tigers have their tender hours and prouder lions bow beneath loves powers thou prouder yet than that imperious beast alone denyst him shelter in thy breast but why should i the creatures only name that sense partake as owners of this flame love farther goes nor stops his course at these the plants he moves and gently bends the trees see how those willows mix their amorous boughs and how that vine clasps her supporting spouse the silver firr dotes on the stately pine by love those elms by love those beeches join but view that oak behold his rugged side yet that rough bark the melting flame does hide all by their trembling leaves in sighs declare and tell their passions to the gathering air which had but love over thee the least command thou by their motions too might understand amintor being asked by thirsis who is the object of his love speaks as follows amint thirsis to thee i mean that name to show which only yet our groves and fountains know that when my death shall through the plains be told thou with the wretched cause may that unfold to everyone who shall my story find carved by thy hand in some fair beeches rind beneath whose shade the bleeding body lay that when by chance she shall be led that way over my sad grave the haughty nymph may go and the proud triumph of her beauty show to all the swains to strangers as they pass and yet at length she may but oh alas i fear too high my flattering hopes do soar yet she at length may my sad fate deplore may weep me dead may over my tomb recline and sighing wish were he alive and mine but mark me to the end   their go on for well i do thy speech attend perhaps to better ends than yet thou know  amint being now a child or but a youth  mo when scarce to reach the blushing fruit i knew which on the lowest bending branches grew still with the dearest sweetest kindest maid young as myself at childish sports i played the fairest sure of all that lovely kind who spread their golden tresses to the wind cydippes daughter and montanos heir whose flocks and herds so numerous do appear the beauteous sylvia she it is she i love warmth of all hearts and pride of every grove with her i lived no turtles ever so fond our houses met but more our souls were joined together nets for fish and fowl we laid together through the spacious forest strayed pursued with equal speed the flying deer and of the spoils there no divisions were but whilst i from the beasts their freedom won alas i know not how my own was gone by unperceived degrees the fire increased which filled at last each corner of my breast as from a root though scarce discerned so small a plant may rise that grows amazing tall from sylvias presence now i could not move and from her eyes took in full draughts of love which sweetly through my ravished mind distilled et in the end such bitterness would yield that often i sighed ere yet i knew the cause and was a lover ere i dreamed i was but oh at last too well my state i knew and now will show thee how this passion grew then listen while the pleasing tale i tell  thirsis persuades amintor not to despair upon the predictions of mopsus discovring him to be an impostor thirsis why do thou still give way to such despair  amintor too just alas the weighty causes are mopsus wise mopsus who in art excels and of all plants the secret virtue tells knows with what healing gifts our spring a bound and of each bird explains the mystic sound twas he even he my wretched fate foretold  their do thou this speech then of that mops hold who whilst his smiles attract the easy view drops flattering words soft as the falling dew whose outward form all friendly still appears though fraud and daggers in his thoughts he wears and the unwary labors to surprise with looks affected and with riddling lies if he it is that bids thy love despair i hope the happier end of all thy care so far from truth his vain predictions fall  amint if ought thou know that may my hopes recall conceal it not for great i have heard his fame and feared his words   their  when hither first i came and in these shades the false impostor met like thee i prized and thought his judgment great on all his studied speeches still relied nor feared to err whilst led by such a guide when on a day that business and delight my steps did to the neighboring town invite which stands upon that rising mountains side and from our plains this river does divide he checked me thus  be warned in time my son and that new world of painted mischiefs shun whose gay inhabitants thou shall behold plumed like our birds and sparkling all in gold courtiers that will thy rustic garb despise and mock thy plainness with disdainful eyes but above all that structure see thou fly where hoarded vanities and witchcrafts lie to shun that path be thy peculiar care i ask what of that place the dangers are to which he soon replies there shall thou meet of soft enchantresses the enchantments sweet who subtly will thy solid sense bereave and a false gloss to every object give brass to thy sight as polished gold shall seem and glass thou as the diamond shall esteem huge heaps of silver to thee shall appear which if approached will prove but shining air the very walls by magic art are wrought and repetition to all speakers taught not such as from our echoes we obtain which only our last words return again but speech for speech entirely there they give and often add beyond what they receive their downy couches to false rest invite the lawn is charmed that faintly bars the light no gilded seat no ivory board is there but what thou may for some delusion fear whilst farther to abuse thy wondering eyes strange antic shapes before them shall arise fantastic fiends that will about thee flock and all they see with imitation mock nor are these ills the worst thyself may be transformed into a flame a stream a tree a tear congealed by art thou may remain till by a burning sigh dissolved again thus spoke the wretch but could not shake my mind my way i take and soon the city find where above all that lofty fabric stands which with one view the town and plains commands here was i stopped for who could quit the ground that heard such music from those roofs resound music beyond the enticing syrenes note music beyond the swans expiring throat beyond the softest voice that charms the grove and equaled only by the spheres above my ear i thought too narrow for the art nor fast enough conveyed it to my heart when in the entrance of the gate i saw a man majestic and commanding awe yet tempered with a carriage so refined that undetermined was my doubtful mind whether for love or war that form was most designed with such a brow as did at once declare a gentle nature and a wit severe to view that palace me he asked to go though royal he and i obscure and low but the delights my senses there did meet no rural tongue no swain can cer repeat celestial goddesses or nymphs as fair in unveiled beauties to all eyes appear sprinkled with gold as glorious to the view as young aurora decked with pearly dew bright rays dispensing as along they passed and with new light the shining palace graced phabus was there by all the muses met and at his feet was our elpino set even humble me their harmony inspired my breast expanded and my spirits fired rude pastral now no longer i rehearse but heroes crown with my exalted verse of arms i sung of bold adventurous wars and though brought back by my too envious stars yet kept my voice and reed those lofty strains and sent loud music through the wondering plains which mopsus hearing secretly malignd and now to ruin both at once designed which by his sorceries he soon brought to pass and suddenly so clogged and hoarse i was that all our shepherds at the change amazed believed i on some evningwolf had gazed when he it was my luckless path had crossed by whose dire look my skill awhile was lost this have i told to raise thy hopes again and render by distrust his malice vain  from the aminta of tasso though we of small proportion see and slight the armed golden be yet if her sting behind she leaves no ease the envenomed flesh receives love less to sight than is this fly in a soft curl concealed can lie under an eyelids lovely shade can form a dreadful ambuscade can the most subtle sight beguile hid in the dimples of a smile but if from thence a dart he throw how sure how mortal is the blow how helpless all the power of art to bind or to restore the heart from the aminta of tasso part of the description of the golden age then by some fountains flowery side the loves unarmed did still abide then the loosed quiver careless hung the torch extinct the bow unstrung then by the nymphs no charms were worn but such as with the nymphs were born the shepherd could not then complain nor told his amorous tale in vain no veil the beauteous face did hide nor harmless freedom was denied then innocence and virtue reigned pure unaffected unconstrained love was their pleasure and their praise the soft employment of their days to the nightingale exert thy voice sweet harbinger of spring this moment is thy time to sing this moment i attend to praise and set my numbers to thy lays free as thine shall be my song as thy music short or long poets wild as thee were born pleasing best when unconfined when to please is least designed soothing but their cares to rest cares do still their thoughts molest and still the unhappy poets breast like thine when best he sings is placed against a thorn she begins let all be still muse thy promise now fulfill sweet oh sweet still sweeter yet can thy words such accents fit can thou syllables refine melt a sense that shall retain still some spirit of the brain till with sounds like these it join twill not be then change thy note let division shake thy throat hark division now she tries yet as far the muse outslies cease then prithee cease thy tune trifler will thou sing till june till thy business all lies waste and the time of buildings past thus we poets that have speech unlike what thy forests teach if a fluent vein be shown that is transcendent to our own criticize reform or preach or censure what we cannot reach the atheist and the acorn methinks this world is oddly made and every things amiss a dull presuming atheist said as stretched he lay beneath a shade and instanced in this behold quoth he that mighty thing a pumpkin large and round is held but by a little string which upwards cannot make it spring or bear it from the ground whilst on this oak a fruit so small so disproportioned grows that who with sense surveys this all this universal casual ball its ill contrivance knows my better judgment would have hung that weight upon a tree and left this mast thus slightly strung amongst things which on the surface sprung and small and feeble be no more the caviller could say nor farther faults descry for as he upwards gazing lay an acorn loosened from the stay fell down upon his eye the offended part with tears ran over as punished for the sin fool had that bough a pumpkin bore thy whimseys must have worked no more nor scull had kept them in the tradesman and the scholar a citizen of mighty pelf but much a blockhead in himself disdained a man of shining parts master of sciences and arts who left his book scarce once a day for sober coffee smoke or tea nor spent more money in the town than bought when need required a gown which way of living much offends the alderman who gets and spends and grudges him the vital air who drives no trade and takes no care why bookworm to him once he cried why setting thus the world aside do thou thy useless time consume enclosed within a lonely room and poring damnify thy wit till not for men or manners fit hopst thou with urging of thy vein to spin a fortune from thy brain or gain a patron that shall raise thy solid state for empty praise no trust not to your soothings vile received per mes the only style

thus to unfold his breast and taught succeeding times an easy way their secret thoughts by letters to convey to bassle absence and secure delight which till that time was limited to sight the parting farewell spoke the last adieu the lessening distance past then loss of view the friend was gone which some kind mome ga and absence separated like the grave the wings of love were tender too till then

field own to be fruitful greece yet not so clean those ears were reaped but still there is some to glean and from the lands of vast invention come daily new authors with discovries home this curious piece which i shall now impart fell from malherbe a master in his art to racan filled with like poetic fire both tuneful servants of apollos choir rivals and heirs to the horatian lyre who meeting him one day free and alone for still their thoughts were to each other known thus asked his aid  some useful counsel give thou who by living long have learnt to live whose observation nothing can escape tell me how i my course of life shall shape to something i would fix eret be too late you know my birth my talents my estate shall i with thee content all search resign and to the country my desires consine or in the court or camp advancement gain the worlds a mixture of delight and pain though rough it seems there is pleasure in the wars and hymens joys are not without their cares i need not ask to what my genius tends but would content the world the court my friends please all the world in haste malherbe replies how vain the attempt will prove in him that tries learn from a fable i have somewhere found before i answer all that you propound a miller and his son the father old the boy about some fifteen years had told designed their ass to sell and for the fair some distance off accordingly prepare but lest she in the walk should lose her flesh and not appear for sale so full and fresh her feet together tied between them two they heaved her up and on the rusticks go till those who met them bearing thus the ass cried are these fools about to act a farce surely the beast however it seem to be is not the greatest ass of all the three the miller in their mirth his folly finds and down he sets her and again unbinds and though her grumbling showed she liked m me the lazy way she traveled in before he minds her not but up the boy he sets upon her back and on the crupper gets thus on they jog when of three men that passed the eldest thinking age to be disgraced called to the youth ho you young man for shame come down lest passengers your manners blame and say it ill becomes your tender years to ride before a grandsire with gray hairs truly the gentlemen are in the right the miller cries and makes the boy alight then forward slides himself into his place and with a mind content renews his pace but much he had not gained upon his way before a troop of damsels neat and gay partial to youth to one another cried see how with walking by that dotards side the boy is tired whilst with a prelates state he rides alone and dangling in the seat hangs like a calf thrown up across the beast the miller thinking to have spoiled that jest replied he was too old for veal to pass but after more on him and on his ass he stands convinced and takes his son again to ride at ease himself still next the mane yet ere he would thirty paces borne the lad the next they met cried  are these fellows mad have they no pity thus toerload the jade sure at the fair they for her skin may trade see how is she spent and sinks beneath their strokes the miller whom this most of all provokes swears by his cap he shows his want of brains who thus to please the world bestows his pains however well try if this wayt may be done and off he comes and fetches down his son behind they walk and now the creature drive but could no better in their purpose thrive nor escape a fellows censure whom they meet that cries to spare the ass they break their feet and whilst unladen at her ease she goes trudge in the dirt and batter out their shoes as if to burden her they were afraid and men for beasts not beasts for men were mad the proverb right the cart before the horse the miller finding things grow worse and worse cries out i am an ass it is agreed and so are all who would in this succeed hereafter though reproof or praise i find i will neither heed but follow my own mind take my own counsel how my beast to sell this he resolved and did it and did well for you sir follow love the court the war obtain the crosier or the citys furr live single all your days or take a

time in praising thee they spend and thy protecting power commend the shepherd here from scorching freed tunes to thy dancing leaves his reed whilst his loved nymph in thanks bestows her flowery chaplets on thy boughs shall i then only silent be and no return be made by me no let this wish upon thee wait and still to flourish be thy fate to future ages may thou stand untouched by the rash workmans hand till that large stock of sap is spent which gives thy summers ornament till the fierce winds that vainly strive to shock thy greatness whilst alive shall on thy lifeless hour attend prevent the axe and grace thy end their scattered strength together call and to the clouds proclaim thy fall who then their evningdews may spare when thou no longer art their care but shall like ancient heroes burn and some bright hearth be made thy urn a nocturnal reverie in such a night when every louder wind is to its distant cavern safe confined and only gentle zephyr fans his wings and lonely philomel still waking sings or from some tree famed for the owls delight she hollowing clear directs the wanderer right in such a night when passing clouds give place or thinly vail the heavens mysterious face when in some river overhung with green the waving moon and trembling leaves are seen when freshend grass now bears it self upright and makes cool banks to pleasing rest invite whence springs the woodbind and the bramblerose and where the sleepy cowslip sheltered grows whilst now a paler hue the foxglove takes yet checquers still with red the dusky brakes when scattered glowworms but in twilight fine show trivial beauties watch their hour to shine whilst salisbry stands the test of every light in perfect charms and perfect virtue bright when odours which declined repelling day through temperate air uninterrupted stray when darkened groves their softest shadows wear and falling waters we distinctly hear when through the gloom more venerable shows some ancient fabric awful in repose while sunburnt hills their swarthy looks conceal and swelling haycocks thicken up the vale when the loosed horse now as his pasture leads comes slowly grazing through the adjoining meads whose stealing pace and lengthened shade we fear till torn up forage in his teeth we hear when nibbling sheep at large pursue their food and unmolested kine rechew the cud when curlews cry beneath the villagewalls and to her straggling brood the partridge calls their shortlivd jubilee the creatures keep which but endures whilst tyrant man does sleep when a sedate content the spirit feels and no fierce light disturbs whilst it reveals but silent musings urge the mind to seek something too high for syllables to speak till the free soul to a composdness charmed finding the elements of rage disarmed over all below a solemn quiet grown joys in the inferior world and thinks it like her own in such a night let me abroad remain till morning breaks and all is confused again our cares our

servile fetters tied which broke the bondage of the proud messenians whom sparta long had held in hard subjection ere yet their captive general does appear be it amongst your selves my lords resolved what course will answer best our ends upon them speak you clarinthus formost of the assembly and then let every one add what he pleases  clar short be my speech and plain as is the way which must secure what lacedemon toils for let him resign that country kept by him from the entire subjection to our yoke or let his speedy death deliver to us what his too active life has long kept back  anax what say the rest   all the sen all all agree to this  clar no middle course can be of use to sparta  anax it is enough call for the prisoner there  a lord bring in the prisoner it is the kings command  aristomenes is brought in by the guard aristor in a spartan dress presses in amongst the crowd whilst phila appears at the door anax at last we see the hero can be conquered to clar  clar not in his looks for they are haughty still and so his mind will prove if i mistake not  anax that you our prisoner now of late our foe have urged that country where you rule in chief to break our yoke and make incursions on us since known to all will justify our sentence which is that you shall meet the death deserved unless to keep our quiet for the future you bring again messenia to our sway paying such tribute as shall be imposed by us the lords of that offensive state this is the choice we kindly set before you and wish that you would take the safest part  aristom enslave my country to secure my life that power forbid it under whose protection i have often fought her battles with success and drove the illgrounded war home to your sparta  clar he braves us in his bond then you would dye  aristom i do not say i would i am a man and nature bars that saying yet i dare dye no spartan here but knows it but since the fates whose wills we best can read when thus unfolded in their dire events tell me by these vile bonds i must submit propose the gentlest bargain you can make and if i find my life bears equal weight i am content to take it else it is yours  anax it is not for us to wave or change our terms mistaken men who think not of our power and that we may command what we propose since the first sally now must take possession of what your frighted rout will soon abandon  aristom my frighted rout ye basely wrong with foul reproachful names those valiant troops which yet ye cannot conquer for know thou proud insulting anaxander there is at their head a resolute young man that will not bate thee in his strict account one sigh or groan thy tortures or thy dungeons shall wrest in dying from his fathers bosom anaxander and the senate talk among themselves whilst aristor comes forward upon the stage but there he stands aside seeing aristor aristor through that spartan dress i view and never till now wished not to see my son protect him from their knowledge some kind power if youth or virtue ever engaged your pity  clar let it be so and speedily performed aloud for he will never yield to what has been demanded  anax you named the dungeon with a threaten too of swift revenge thinking to fright our justice but well take care first to perform our part then venture what your daring son can offer the dungeon is his sentence thither bear him  aristor not till this hand has done a swifter justice draws and runs at anax anax ha what means this my guards he avoids the thrust phila runs in phila help soldiers help seize that distracted spartan who now has got a sword disarm and take him they disarm him aristor it is false stand off ye slaves and know i am   phila oh stop his mouth for if he raves he dies they stop his mouth with a handkerchief aristom as sure as now he lives had he spoke more aside therefore be blessed the stratagem that stopped him  anax what means this phila speak who is this madman  phila one by a friend entrusted to my care sent from the country here to find a cure but hearing as the crowd passed by his lodgings that aristomenes would soon be sentenced he broke his ward and fancied he must save him i have pursued him till i am faint with crying and am confounded at his frantic passion oh royal sir forgive it   anax we do and pity him remove him hence then to thy mistress my dear daughter go and say we now again shall soon see sparta  phila i shall my lord now follow me i will lead ye to his lodgings to the guards exit phila with the guards bearing off aristor aristom whoever she be may heaven reward her if she means his safety aside now i can meditate on my own fortunes and slight the worst can reach me  anax he is deep in thought which may produce a change again i will try him  to clar now aristomenes that this wild chance has given you time to think upon our sentence have you enough considered of it is horror to bend your stubborn will to our demands  aristom yes anaxander i have weighed it well that active faculty which we call fancy soon as you spoke dragged me thus bound by slaves through the thronged streets exciting several passions the barbarous crowd shouted their clamorous joy because unpunished they might sport with blood old men and matrons destined long for death with envious pleasure saw me forced before them to tread that path in spite of vigorous nature whilst tender virgins turned aside their heads and dropped in silence the soft tears of pity but oh the soldiers from the soldiers hands methoughts i saw their swords neglected thrown when fortune showed they could not save the bravest if once she frowned from such a fate as mine  clar he will move the crowd urge him to speak directly  anax all this is from the purpose plainly tell whether you will meet our mercy or the dungeon  aristom my train of thoughts to that dark cave had led me i stood reclined upon the horrid brim and gazed into it till my baffled sight piercing beyond the many jetting rocks that help to break by turns the falling body was lost in shades where it must rest forever and ready now to be pushed rudely off this was my last and best reflection on it that there dwelt peace which is not to be found in his dark bosom that has sold his country  anax away with him to instant trial of it see this obeyed and plunge him headlong down there he will have time if life for such fine thoughts away

cursed deed they cannot prevent oh aristomenes my noble father hear me ye fates and let me but revenge him give me revenge and now methinks i grasp it broke through his guards i seize upon the tyrant and stab him thus and thus  he acts all this then bear him to the ground thus falling on him and to his heart thus tearing my wide way oh of of of  throws himself upon the ground enter amalintha the door by one without immediately locked after her amal where is this wretched mourner oh let me find him though to raise his sorrows with the sad sound of my repeated groans ha on the ground then be it

her handkerchief before her eyes weeping aristor whoever thou art repeat again that sound such groans shall hourly issue from his dungeon and fright the bloody spartans into madness he looks up ha sure i should know that form that shape those limbs that laboring bosom and those locks dissheveld but take not from thy face that friendly cloud do not expose it lest through all it is charms my deep revenge find out whose stamp it bears and urge me on to something dark and fatal  amal this from aristor this to amalintha she rises and shows her face aristor why woudst thou tempt me thus adventurous maid and bring the blood of anaxander near me coming up fiercely to her can thou too sondly think that loves soft bands his gentle cords of hyacinths and roses wovein the dewy spring when storms are silent can tie these islands provoked by horrid murder oh do not trust it  but fly this ground while i have power to bid thee  amal aristor no my flight shall not preserve me the life i have kept but to indulge your love now to this loud mistaken rage i offer take it oh take it means cannot be wanting although no instrument of death be near you this hair these slatterd locks these oncelovd tresses round my sad neck thus knit will soon perform it or on these trembling lips your hand but pressed will send the rising breath down to my heart and break it telling who denied it passage  aristor trial beyond the strength of man and lover  amal or if you would be quicker in dispatch speak but a few such words as now you uttered and my poor hovering soul will fly before em farewell aristor see the work is done i did but think i heard their killing sound and the bare fancy saves you farther study she faints he catches her in his arms aristor oh stop the glorious fugitive a moment and i will whisper to it such repentance such love such fondness such unheard of passion as shall confine it to it is beauteous mansion thus let me hug and press thee into life and lend thee motion from my beating heart to set again the springs of thine in working  amal i hear your summons and my life returns but tell me ere again so firm it is fixed that it must cost an agony like this to let it out to liberty and ease will you not hate me for my fathers guilt  aristor by the soft fires of love that fill my breast and dart through all the horrors of my soul like heavens bright flashes in a night of shadows i will not hate or ever reproach thee more yet let me breathe so gently one complaint so gently that it may not break thy peace though it for ever has discarded mine and ask why you thus cruelly would use me why have me seized and bound with frantic fetters snatched from my duty by a womans wile and here confined whilst my great father perished  amal twas none of mine by your dear self i swear it was the fates design and philas action she saw you thus disguised amongst the crowd and ere she would acquaint me with you danger followed to watch the means how to prevent it  aristor i will believe you to my hearts relief which must have broke had your consent beer with her but amalintha now my rage is gone and love through this mistake has forced his way it spreads before my thoughts the gaudy scene of those delights which have been once allowed it brings to my fancy in their softest dress the gentle hours that told our private meetings shows me the grove where by the moons pale light we have breathd out tender sighs till coming day has drawn them deeper warning us to part which never we did till some new time was set for the return of those transporting pleasures  amal and so again aristor well contrive and so again well meet and sigh and love  aristor oh of of  amalintha  amal oh why that groan that deep that deathlike groan  aristor when soul and body part it cannot be softer and i must leave thee soul to sad aristor with all those pleasures which i but repeated as dying friends will catch one last embrace of what they know they must forego forever  amal indeed you have called my wandering fancy back from those delights where twoud have endless strayed but my aristor for i will call you mine though all the stars combine against my title and bar fulfilling of the vows they have witnessed tell me though we must never in nuptials join may we not meet and at this distance sigh and when i have hoarded up a stock of tears which in the spartans sight i dare not lavish oh tell me if i may not seek you out and in large showers thus pour them down before you she weeps arictor cease to oppress me more thou weeping beauty and think with what vast storms my soul is tossed comes up to hear earnestly think too that but to gaze upon thee thus to stand in reach of thy ambrosial breath and hear thy voice sweet as the evening notes when in still shades the shepherds sooth their loves i would not mind an army in my way or stop at raging seas or brazen towers yet amalintha though i dye to speak it yet we must part we must my amalintha  amal never to meet again tell me but that  aristor alas not i the fates can only tell it let them make even one account betwixt us and give this hand the liberty to seal it and well in spite of vengeful thunder join if then thy heart be as resolved as mine  amal no on those terms you mean we must not meet but since those fates deny it to your power the will i to your mighty wrongs forgive from without the door  phila madam you will be surpised haste to return your fathers now just going to your lodgings  aristor all plagues and curses meet him aside  amal oh then i must be gone a little time will call the state to council and when the crowd by that is thither drawn one i will send to wait on your escape and if you tempt new dangers know aristor that amalintha too will perish in them  aristor fear not my love  phila haste madam haste or we are all undone from without  amal so from his few short moments calls away a gasping wretch the cruel bird of prey bids him make haste the eternal shades to find and leave like me all that is dear behind  aristor whilst like the friend that is sadly weeping by i see the much loved spirit from me fly and with vain cries pursue it to that coast where it must land and my weak hopes be lost he leads her to the door and returns speaking as he is going out at the other now let revenge a while sustain my heart and fate yet close my life with some exalted part exit the stage darkened represents the inside of a dungeon aristomenes lying down in it and struggling as coming out of a swoon aristom at last it is vanquished and my soaring spirits dispel the gloomy vapors that oppressed them and clothed my dreams with more than mortal horror so low in my deep fancy was i plunged that over my head impetuous rivers rushed and mountains grew betwixt our world and me hungry and cold methought i wandered on through fruitless plains that food nor comfort nourished till hideous serpents twisted me about and drew me to their den all foul and loathsome but i will quit the bed that breeds such visions and summon all my officers to council for with tomorrows dawn well storm phaerea he walks about feeling for the door ha where is

a tree enter climander looking toward the camp as expecting the return of arcasius clim he has exceeded much the time prefixed and yet i would not doubt him i have climbed the hill better to view the camp and all are fixed and motionless as death therefore a while i will command my patience he cannot now be long  he turns and sees herm and gazes earnestly on her  ha who lies there a lovely shepherdess but faint she seems say beauteous maid if so much strength is left how best a stranger may assist or serve you he kneels down by her she does not speak but looks into my heart and melts it to the softness of her eyes hard by a spring clear as the tears she drops runs bubbling under a delicious shade water thence fetched in a pomegranates rind may call her fainting spirits to their office he goes out herm he is gone but quickly will return again yet he is so gentle sure i need not fear him though at his first approach my heart beat high till halcyon sounds and words of pity calmed it nay something courtly in them was implied and if the swains are polished all like him their humble sheds may scorn our ruder greatness  enter again climander with water in a pomgranateshell

he whom you invoked reward you largely  clim oh you may far outdo all he can grant in but declaring where you feed your flocks and to what shade when phoebus hottest shines you lead those happy sheep to scape his fury that i exposing mine to the wide plains may seek you out and sigh till night before you  herm alas i have no flocks or skill to guide them no leafy hamlet strewn with painted flowers or mossy pillow to repose my head but wander from a distant fatal place where i have lost my parents and my succor and now in such a habit as becomes it seek the low plains to learn the art you practice  clim she may be noble then and for her form it is sure the fairest that my eyes ever fixed on aside who were your parents gentle maid declare  herm they were not mean and yet i must conceal

oracle he was confessed of all the race of men to be the best  clim the best of men and you the fairest woman and in a moment i the greatest lover he speaks this transportedly and seizes her hand which he kisses whilst to complete my bliss by heavens decree these beauties all are mine and thus i claim them  herm protect me all ye powers that wait on virtue from the dark ends of such unruly transports she takes her hand away hastily and rises nor dare presumptuous swain once to renew them or tempt more dangers than a crook can answer  clim a man there lives not should have urged that to me built round with steel or plunged all over in styx then let your beautys triumphs be complete which after such a threat can bend my knee and make me sue for pardon as for life  herm i can forgive whilst i forbid such language since she who yields to have her beauty worshipped must pay too much to him that brings the incense  clim to me you cannot it is a debt to fate your heart is mine the amorous stars ordain it which smiling hung over my auspicious birth and not an angry planet crossed their influence they bid me love and the harmonious god when asked what path should lead me on to glory sent forth a sound that charmed the hoary priest and said a passion soft as that must bless me then do not strive to disappoint their purpose or quench celestial flames with scorn or coldness oh that a smile might tell me that you would not a gentle word a look a sigh confirm it or any sign that bears the stamp of love but it is in vain and some more happy youth has drawn my lot and mocked foretelling phabus  herm i must not leave you with a thought that wrongs me for know no passion ever possessed this breast nor will the mighty griefs that now have seized it ever yield to give a softer guest admittance but my companion comes shepherd farewell when next we meet if heaven that moment sends for your assistance lent we may be friends  clim heaven cannot be true if it no more

supplied what fortune had denied him for attraction claimed my weak heart and said he must possess it  bar sure they have put off this melancholy meeting designed in honor of their lost protector in which our share though secret must be greatest i see none move nor hear their mournful notes  herm be not impatient where can we be better have i not heard thee say sometimes barina that in a dream formed by the days discourse of the sweet life that here they led in safety my mother saw me wed one of these swains and smiled though i had made a choice below me  bar she did and therefore never would consent that you like others should behold their revels nor have i since her death left you my charge allowed it till worse dangers forced us hither though of my self i never observe such trifles  herm do you call those nightly visions then but trifles  bar no doubt our dreams are so the work of fancy where things of yesterday are odly piecd with what had passed some twenty years before knit in a weak and disproportioned chain which cannot hold to lead us to the future whatever i have said i wish this had no meaning aside and that some other place could give us shelter  herm well walk a while  great aristomenes now could i meet thee but that is a blessing which i must not know aside till where thine is my spirit too shall go oh that my grief would force it to retire and

of love  enter climander behind her clim from those fair lips no sooner fell that word but all the neighboring echoes caught the sound and sent it doubled to climanders bosom the amorous streams have borne it down their banks and the glad plains breathe nothing since but love oh speak it once again and the fond vine shall with a stricter grasp embrance the elm whilst joyful birds shall hail it from the branches  herm no i have spoke too much  since on these plains no syllable is secret hereafter my close thoughts shall be confined and in this breast locked up from all mens knowledge  clim oh not if love be there it cannot be silence can never last long nor yet conceal it a thousand ways twill speak without a voice and whilst it struggles to obtain that freedom betraying sighs will scape and more declare it t will speak in listening to the lovers tale and say it is sympathy that makes it pleasant  herm he shakes my soul whilst thus he does describe it for all he speaks i feel and he must find aside oh yet let me reflect upon my birth and quit in time the ground i cannot maintain shes going clim nay do not fly me and i will be speechless for if i speak whilst on your eyes i gaze it must be all of love and that offends you yet since perhaps i never may meet you more i would have told the story of my heart and ever it breaks have moved you to compassion  herm meet him no more then what can crowns afford me amidst the noisie pomp that waits their luster still should i vainly listen for the sound aside of such soft words which charm my sorrows from me oh that our births were equal as our thoughts yet i will pity him and fate be guilty she stops and turns toward him clim blessed be the thought that thus retards your steps and turns again those gentle lights upon me if pity twas oh yet indulge that warmth and lovetwill soon produce to meet my wishes she looks kindly on him it is done it is done be witness ye still skies that all her looks are calm and smooth as yours and not one frown forbids my forward hopes let this fair hand be added to confirm them and case the mighty longings of my passion kneels and kisses her hand herm take freely take this first and last of favors now shepherd rise and hear what i have to say and if a sigh mix with the fatal sentence believe it is from the grief with which i give it you must not love me  she sighs clim i must not love you though you sigh to speak it should pan pronounce it in a voice so loud twoud rive the knotty oaks that shade his altars i would to syrinxes oppose your beauties and ask the gods whose loves had best foundation  herm those gods who made our births so disproportioned would say they never designed our hands should join but see the swains are gathering toward this place yet shepherd know that if a prince would love it is in your form he must successful prove  enter arcasius with a casket clim then in this happy form since you approve it behold  she interrupts him herm no more as you would keep thesteem i have shown you exit clim another time must tell this secret to her the ambition of her mind charms like her person aside nor can the blood that bleeds such thoughts be abject but welcome good arcasius with that bait which shall be soon dispersed among the soldiers and if it win them to my great design it is worth the kingdoms which its price might ransom exeunt with the casket followed by arcasius enter theata and lamia lamia the dews are falling and the sun declined whilst from this neighboring grove are heard the notes of that sweet bird that warbles to the night now telling us her shadows are approaching and yet the tardy shepherds are not come  theata when all our hours were gay it was not thus but who can haste to break his cheerful pipe tear the sweet garland made by her he sighs for and sing of death when love is all his passion  lamia now thou do talk of love yet ere we part or fall into our melancholy strains lend to that echo greedy of thy voice some moving words upon so soft a subject  theata rather that song i would choose which does prefer to all things else the joys of these sweet plains since now perhaps we must too soon forsake them  lamia a better cannot be chose haste to perform it lest the sad ceremony break our purpose  the song   she sings a young shepherd his life in soft pleasure still leads tunes his voice to his reed and makes love in the shades to be great to be wise to be rich to be proud to be loaded with business or lost in a crowd he never seeks or desires let but silvia be won he is great he is rich and his business is done   whilst their nymphs are as happy as happy as fair for who has most beauty has of lovers most share some will stay some will sly some be false some be true for the lost we never grieve but still cherish the new shouts it is vain of their frailties or falsehoods to mind em mankind we must take we must take as we find em    theala what shouts are these shouts lamia they are loud and speak some joy and still repeated  enter herminia and barina lamia fair stranger know you whence these shouts proceed  herm i do not but these coming sure can tell us  enter with great signs of joy clinias with other shepherds and shepherdesses etc clim swell swell panisus over thy spacious bounds flow like our joy and cheer the meads about thee pan take in thankful sacrifice our flocks and every rural swain proclaim his praises  lamia such sounds as these meet with a general welcome but yet the cause we wish to hear explained good clinias tell the cause   clin he is returned and stands like fate amongst em the plains protector and the armys genius the virgins refuge when the towns in flames and shield to those whom fortune makes his vassals  herm it is aristomenes thou have described no other ever could fill a praise like this  clin it is he indeed next to the gods our succor  herm transporting news how did the army meet him  clin just as a long stopped current meets the sea and rushes on when once t has forced a passage   d shep heaven has their plumes for high as that they toss em and not a dusty soldier in the host that has not hugged him to his swarthy bosom  clin no voice is what it was an hour ago and their hoarse joy sounds like their distant drums his hands as if the cretan thongs still held them are useless made and fettered now with kisses whilst neighing steeds think that the war surrounds them and prance in air light as their masters minds   d shep how he escaped all ask in such confusion that their loud questions drive his answers back and will not let them reach the nearest to him  herm it is enough ye powers that guard messenia we now must change our habits and return aside to bar what did i say return o yes i must and never hope to see climander more to herself yet will i give my heart this last relief since fate will have it bear the unequal passion to let him know my love and endless flight and live on the dear thought that he laments it exit with bar lam where is aristor is he too returned  clin that question did the general ask aloud and twas the only one that could be heard but no reply was made i think he is not  theata then we are but half restored  for he so heavily will take that loss our joys will not be long nor he amongst us  la  not the worst    d shep i met a rumor of a stranger prince that with large sums new fired the trembling host and from the camp had led on some design a party that for wealth would risque their lives though cold and dull to thoughts of generous duty  clin it is true of rhodes they say and some i heard that called him demagetus thick flew his gold as swarms of summerbees and twas to succor or revenge the general he asked their aid  but whither he has led them none can tell ere aristomes returned he went and is not heard of since   d shep the genrals safe and that is enough for us now therefore clinias you that guide our sports tell us what we are to do to show our joy  clin to laugh

had searched messenias utmost bound and traveled over the spacious world of shepherds she must be yet amongst their shades concealed and through them will i pierce like prying phoebus to find my love or lose myself for ever  arca you will not hear so much your passion sways the reasons why i chose to see you first ere i proceeded to pursue her paths  dema there spoke the sixty winters that have froze thee and turned swift eager love to icy reasons i must be cold as thou art if i hear thee or lose one moment more in doting questions hes going arca behold these tokens and let them retard you  dema tokens of love sent to the fond climander oh thou have found a way indeed to stay me  arca take that to you directed a letter and twas my hopes from thence of some discovery that kept me here till you had broke and read it  dema then thou shall hear it reads the direction this to climander from the nymph that leaves him to everlasting grief should have been added for so twill prove if no more comforts here he reads it to love yet from the object fly harder is than it is to dye yet for ever i remove yet for ever will i love shepherd seek no more to find fate not i has been unkind we pluck on fate by striving to avoid it to shun the low addresses of a swain for ever has she left a prince despairing why did thou not as i at parting bid thee find out and let her know my fair intentions and that my birth was noble as her wishes  arca i was not negligent nor would be thought so but full of transports when i heard your story thinking the fates would now fulfill their promise through her the daughter to the best of men fled to discover what you gave in charge traversed the plains in a long fruitless search but could not find that beauty born to bless us  dema i showed thee as we passed her new raised hamlet  arca thither at last i went but oh too late for ere i reached it the fair guest was vanished upon the floor lay her neglected hook and over the door hung boughs of fading willow to show as shepherds use the place forsaken that paper there i found and near it lay this precious gemm that bears a wellcut signet shews him a ring by chance sure dropped yet may assist your purpose  dema give me that emblem of my fatal passion for without end is that as is this circle oh that my way to bliss should seem so plain yet in a moment thus be lost and wilderd now in the midst of crowds and loud applauses that greet me for restoring them aristor must wretched demagetus sigh for love and hang his drooping head though wreathed with laurels a sound of drums and trumpets but hark the general comes  to him the oracle i have revealed and all the story of my rural life i will tell him too the cause of my new grief which to relieve i instantly must leave him  a flourish enter aristomenes aristor alcander and other attendants aristom why demagetus art thou from my sight from these fond arms that ever thus would hold thee embracing him thou kind restorer of my loved aristor come to the camp and hear them shout thy name whilst i declare thee equal in command with him who owes his life to thy young valor  dema alas my lord   aristom a soldier sigh when courting fame attends him i know you love by your own kind confession but that too must succeed since now your birth is known to answer all the great desires which to my wonder did possess the breast of that fair rural maid whose beauty charmed you well send and with the pomp that suits a princess since such your generous passion means to make her have her conducted to a rich pavilion and join your hands as heaven has joined your hearts this my aristor be your pleasing task  enter an attendant to aristomenes attend the princess is without and waits your pleasure  aristom conduct her in  i sent for her to see the generous stranger to alcander  enter behind the company herminia and barina aristor my lord what you command i take in charge to aristomenes tell me my best of friends the way to serve you to demagetus  dema i know it not my self and that is the torture hear me my lord nor think my sorrows light to aristomenes for love the only comfort of fond youth is lost for ever to the poor climander  herm climander  to barina that name and voice bears down my fainting spirits i shall be known yet have not strength to fly where will this end and where is herminias honor to herself  aristom so sad a pause still keeps us in suspense proceed and if there is help on earth well find it  dema at my return made joyful by success with hasty steps and in my heart soft wishes love and a thousand flattering expectations i sled the clamorous praise prepared to meet me and sought the path that led to my desires but ere i was advanced beyond the camp the voice of this old man crossed my sad way and cried she is gone for ever  aristom perhaps it is some mistake if other proofs are wanting to confirm it  dema oh far too many for climanders peace she owned her love and with this signet bound it and in the folds of this dear paper left at once the tokens of my joy and ruin gives the letter and ring to aristomenes herm the character and signet will betray me and now necessity must make me bold aside oh yet ere you proceed to view that paper she throws her self at aristomenes feet wrapped in confusion hear your daughter speak as he is opening the letter and pity in her fate all womens frailty  aristom ha thou do much surprise me but go on and till she has finished let no word be uttered  dema by all my fleeting sorrows it is my love nor could i but to hear her speak be silent aside  aristom proceed and bate those tears that stay thy speech  herm that i have stooped below the blood you gave me and cast my doting love upon that shepherd for such he is although a plume adorns him my wretched hand and now my tongue confesses for by that paper indiscreetly penned the secret would be told should i conceal it but oh my lord since you can never forgive me a sad recluse for ever let me live or dye for love to do my birth more justice  aristom be comforted and farther yet unfold how first you came acquainted with this shepherd  herm to scape the fury of prevailing foes disguised i in your absence sought the plains and in that habit heard the powerful sighs of one that knew not then his own presumption  aristom were he a prince and still would urge his suit woudst thou receive t and bless the powers that sent him  herm i should not hide my thoughts or blush to own them yes i could bless those powers which now undo me  demagetus comes forward demag i cannot wait these forms love plead my pardon when sir i disobey your ordered silence and haste to tell her it is a prince adores her that would have sought her on the lowly plains and for her favor quitted all dominion  aristom then take her thou most worthy prince of rhodes giving her to him and know herminia to increase thy passion thou holdst that noble hand that saved thy brother and give thy father in this new alliance more joy than when he first received and blessed thee  dema let all the joys of earth give place to mine whilst in deep silent raptures i possess them taking her from aristomenes for demagetus is above discourse and will not wrong his love with faint expressions  herm so let mine flow and o barina see i smiling give my hand now to a shepherd yet fear not to offend my mothers ghost  bar no that smiles too and all that love and serve you  arca the fate of rhodes is clear and cheerful now and old arcasius has outlived his cares  aristor now as a brother take this new embrace to demagetus though all the love it shows you had before  aristom conduct her demagetus to her tent i will soon be there and see those rites performed that shall confirm her yours be kind and happy exeunt herminia and demagetus leading her followed by arcasius barina and others aristor is going too but is called back by his father come back aristor and the rest withdraw for something i would say to you in private the attendants go off free from the crowd and unobserved my transports i would embrace and welcome thee to life and with a loud repeated blessing pay the pious care that brought it to such dangers oh that the love of women should be thought to pass the fondness which a father feels when thus he grasps a son of thy perfections embracing him my dear my loved aristor  aristor my prince my general and the best of fathers  aristom thy heart speaks loud and knocking at my breast seems as t would close in conference with mine  aristor it would my lord and strives to force its passage  aristomenes looses his arms from embracing him aristom oh no my son for now i must be plain and tell thee thou do lock some secret there which all my depth of kindness never could fathom i see it in the cloud that shades thy brow and still thy pensive eyes are downwards cast as thou woudst seek the grave or something lower long have i this observed  and thought whole nights away to find the cause which now my son i urge thee to reveal and think that he who best can love thee asks it  aristor oh that you did not love or would not ask it i cannot speak for speaking must offend yet should my silence grieve such mighty goodness twoud break that heart which thus you seek to succor upon my knees a strange request i make offering to kneel but his father takes him up that you would quite forget and think me dead which the approaching battle should confirm and leave you to possess your other comforts  aristom my other comforts all are light to thee and when i would have shared amongst my race impartial kindness as their birthrights claimed still to my heart aristor would be nearest still with a merit not to be withstood would press beyond my cool and equal purpose and seize a double portion of my love and will thou lose it now to keep thy silence  aristor my life i rather would but oh my lord sighs aristom another sigh another yet my son and then let words relieve this mighty passion they will they will the sweetness of thy temper will melt before a just and warm persuasion now let me know it   aristor believe that if twere fit it should be told but oh my lord it is what you must not know  aristom not i aristor if thy soul were bare as is thy faded cheek now to thy father it were most fit  oh think my son who twas that made it noble and trained it in the paths of truth and honor else what had hindered but thou might have been in spite of all the virtues with thee born for education is the stronger nature a bragging coward or a base detractor a slave to wealth or false to faith or friendship lulled in the common arms of some seducer and lost to all the joys of virtuous love  aristor ha virtuous love  aristom what do thou start why so i meant thou shoudst when hastily i pressed that word upon thee to catch that flushing witness in thy face was all this bait contrived no more my son no more dissembling of a truth so plain i see it is love the best of all our passions and framed like thee sure none could ever despair nor can i fear thoudst make a vulgar choice  aristor on idas top not paris made a nobler when of three goddesses he chose the fairest  aristom will she not hear thy love  aristor oh yes with all the softness of her sex and answers it with vows more strong than ours  aristom if thus it be what have thou then to fear  aristor a fathers wrath more dreadful to aristor than is the frown of jove that shakes the poles and makes the gods forget they are immortal  aristom thou wrongst my love in that mistaken terror by all those powers i swear i will not cross thee be she a spartan dame bate me but one and though a foe i yield thou shoudst possess her  aristor i dare not ask my trembling love forbids it who is that one so fatally excepted  aristom then i will by telling thee prevent that trouble it is the tyrant anaxanders daughter whom though i never beheld i must abhor as borrowing her blood from such a fountain  aristor take mine my lord then to wash out that stain offers his breast you will think it has contracted by her love for it is that tyrants daughter i adore and never while life is here will change my purpose  aristom confusion seize those words and her that caused em not groans of earthquakes or the burst of thunder the voice of storms urging the dangerous billows ever struck the sense with sounds of so much horror it must not oh it must not shall not be sooner this dagger though my soul lives in thee drawing amalinthas dagger should let out thine with this prepostrous passion than i would yield it ever should meet success  aristor of all the instruments by vulcan formed that poinard best is fitted to my heart since here is it was whose eyes have deeper pierced it quickly my lord let me receive it here and see me proud in death to wear that favor  aristomenes amazed looks on the dagger and speaks to himself aristom this dagger here is this anaxanders daughters fate then is practicing upon my soul what sudden turns and trials man can bear  aristor oh do not pause  lest fainting with the weight of what i feel i poorly fall unlike your son or soldier  aristom if this were here is here is were the grateful vows with which i rashly charged the life she gave me still to himself  aristor ha not a look not one sad parting word then my own hand thus sets me free for ever offers to stab himself but is stayed by aristomenes aristom hold by love and duty yet a moment hold  aristor my life they have swayed and must command a moment but let it not exceed lest both i cancel and only listen to my wild despair  aristom shall i perform them shall i hear her plead and to a womans claim resign my vengeance no let my ear still sly the fatal suit and from her tears be turned my hardened face what did i say a hasty blush has seized it for but imagining a thing so vile turn back my face from her that shunned not mine when it was death to know and to preserve me no let the fiends be obstinate in ill revenge be theirs while godlike man is grateful  enter an attendant attend pardon my gracious lord this bold intrusion two ladies veiled escaping from phaerea ask with such earnestness for prince aristor that sure their business is of mighty moment from one this ring at her entreaty sir i must deliver gives it to aristor and exit aristom retire and if not called return no more  aristor it is amalinthas ring my amalinthas she is come in time to see me fall her victim  aristom no to receive her from my hand my son since twas from here is i took this healing weapon that has cut off the hate in which i held her twas she that met me rising from my grave and fearless freed the foe to her and sparta then in a grateful promise was i bound not to deny whatever she should request and sure thy love before the pomp of crowns is what a maid must ask that knows its value  aristor the transports of my soul be thus expressed then let me dye for having grieved such goodness embracing his fathers knees  aristom no rise my son go meet and cheer thy love and to this tent conduct the royal maid whilst in that inner part i stand concealed and hear her tell why thus she comes to seel us thence will i issue as occasion calls and giving thee give all i hold most precious he goes into the inner tent aristor goes out at the other door and reenters immediately leading amalintha veiled followed by phila aristor dismiss that cloud and with it all your fears safe in this camp and in aristors love which never was truly blessed till this glad moment now amalintha let my joys overflow and ere i ask what brought thee to my sight let it be filled with thy amazing beauties and with this hand my longing lips be closed kisses her hand amal thus after each short absence may we meet thus pleased thus wrapped in love thus dying fond but oh aristor since i last beheld you so has this life been threatened by the fates that to your arms it is forced for peace and sa fety  aristor still may they prove a haven for my love too strong for all the shocks of rigrous fortune but what beneath thy fathers roof could fright thee or what bold danger break through his protection  amal twas from himself and all the lords of sparta when aristomenes they found escaped high was their rage as billows in a tempest and all the arts of state were put in use to find who had assisted in his flight but still in vain till subtle vile clarinthus   aristor that villain will be first in blood and mischief but could he pry into thy generous heart and find it there that you had nobly done it and are not secret thoughts secure against him  amal i did believe them so till he disproved it for twas his counsel when all others failed to know by speaking gods the deep contrivance and from the oracle in some few moments the full discovry will have reached phaerea which ere it does i was advised to leave by one that heard the horrid voice accuse me and with a speed unmarked outflew the rest  aristor as swiftly may the bounteous gods reward him  amal this my aristor brings me to your tents but not to save my life or scape their fury for should your heart which boldly i will claim be yet denied me by your injured father not all his army should retard my steps from leading to the town and certain ruin for they have sworn it with this imprecation that till it is done no victory may bless them to sacrifice the soul that saved the general  enter aristomenes from the inward tent aristom that army you have named shall first in flames consume the utmost town of lacedemon take your security and softest wishes your dear aristor take and if ought more the fair preserver of his father claims be it but named and at that instant granted  amal beyond aristors heart there is no request no longing thought no hope for amalintha for still his love prescribed their tender limits  aristor oh let it not be thought irrevrent passion if in the awful presence of a father i run upon my joys and grasp em thus embraces her aristom thou well do intimate i should retire for privacy is only fit for lovers  aristor pardon my transport sir nor thus mistake it  aristom no more my son but when the trumpet calls which must be soon remember you are a soldier and that the battle we shall lead to morrow will ask our best of care and preparation  aristor never was i yet wanting to my charge but give me leave here to attend that summons exit aristomenes for oh my amalintha since you are mine since i can tell my heart that darling truth the moments that must take me from thy sight will pass for lost and useless to aristor and this war done which now we soon shall finish for you not there what god will fight for sparta i will swear the sun and radiant light shall part ere i will once be found from this loved presence  amal confirm it all ye soft and gentle powers and let the pattern of a love so perfect reform mankind and bless believing women but can i think it is aristor speaks that i behold and hear you safe from danger whom late i saw assaulted so with death when from the guard a weapon you had snatched and but that brave swords length could keep him from you hope and fond expectation all had left me armed with this dagger full i stood in vain and from my window watched the fatal stroke which soon was to be copied on my heart then had i meant to own your noble love and told mine dying whilst the crowd had trembled  aristor i saw your dire intent and that preserved me for twas to stop your arm that mine performed what else had been above the force of nature and when the drums of demagetus thundered as through the shivered gates he rushed to save me you may remember that i would not meet him till i had told my love what meant the tumult which since has given me fears cold as pale death lest some observer might have charged it on you trumpets sound amal no for too much their own concern engaged them but oh already hark the trumpet calls and jealous fame no longer lets me keep you must you be gone must you obey this summons  aristor oh yes i must it is the voice of honor yet do not weep  be this embrace the earnest of a thousand now let me lead you to herminias tent then think i go more to secure your charms and fight to rest with peace in these fair arms he leads her off act v scene i the scene is the camp a noise of drums and trumpets enter aristomenes aristor demagetus alcander several officers and soldiers enter an officer from the other door and speaks to the general officer my lord i am from alcander bid to say the battle he has marshalled as you ordered and that your presence now is only wanted  aristom tell him we come and let the drums beat higher now my brave followers be your selves to day and more i need not ask that know your valor who have seen you at the backs of spartans ride till their long flight and not your conquest tired you the soldiers shout and oh my sons since they who bravely seek it may meet with death when all his darts are flying let me embrace and breathe my blessings on ye embraces demagetus yet demagetus if i scape him now and victory attends my great endeavor thou shall thriumphant lead me into rhodes where well obey the gods and save thy country  them still youre the best of men as they declared you  aristom now let me fold thee thus my lifes best treasure he embraces aristor but seems disordered and not to feel him in his arms which he often clasps about him thou do not fill my arms it is air i grasp nor do my eyes behold thee  where is my son ha where is my aristor  aristor here my dear lord here pressing to your bosom his voice seems to aristomenes still under his disorder to be low and different to what it was usually aristom from what far distant valley comes thy voice it sounds so hollow scarce my ear receives it  aristor what means my noble father  aristom till now my faithful senses never failed me they talk of omens ha i must not think on it such chilling damps would blast a day of battle aside yet let my evil genius but be true and a famed end is all it can portend me  aristor you reason with your self and turn from us may we not know what thus disturbs your thoughts  aristom nothing  a vapor crossed me but it is gone and now the field the dusty field my sons must be the scene where we shall nobly act what our great spirits and our country urges the trumpet calls with the impatient drum and he that loves his honor let him come he draws his sword and goes off followed by the rest with their swords drawn drums and shouts of battle immediately succeed the noise continues the scene changes to a fine tent enter amalintha followed by phila amal not yet enough when will this discord end is there no happy land where only love and its kind laws prevail where the false trumpet slatters not to death nor the more noisy drum outcries the dying oh phila why should men with hearts unmoved seek the bold war and leave ours trembling for them now whilst i speak a chilling fear surrounds me and every tread i hear is hastening on methinks to tell me all my hopes are perished  phila why should you madam who have passed already unhurt by fortune through more threatening dangers now faint when reason bids you think the best the sound goes from us and the lucky war since you have the promise of your fathers life proceeds as we could wish for the messenians  amal so does it seem but yet my failing spirits sink to my heart and bid it think of ruin last night my dreams showed me aristor bleeding and over my head a screaming voice proclaimed that amalinthas hasty fate had killed him i closed my eyes to catch another vision that might interpret or prevent the first but all in vain no help or comfort found me and wrapped in fears i waked and still continue for what is foretold so fatal to my love  phila your fate work his it rather will protect him but here come tidings and the bearer smiles good let them be and these vain fears will vanish  enter an officer amal from prince aristor does he live and send you  officer madam he does  and bids me say what i my self can witness that lacedemons battle breaks to pieces and soon will give him leave to find you here  amal take this and wear it soldier for your news gives him a jewel and may your honors still outshine its luster stay here whilst i report this to herminia if demagetus too be yet in safety  officer he is and near aristor did i leave him  amal come with me phila yet my heart is heavy and would be forcing tears to my sad eyes but i will repel them with this welcome message and put on all the smiles of love to meet him exit with phila into the tent officer the sentinels have all forsook the tents in hopes to share the plunder of the foe finding by their retiring we prevail but i will report it loudly to the general oh here are some returning are they messenians they wear the habit yet no face i know their haste and looks do seem to point at mischief i will conceal my self and watch their purpose he conceals himself enter clarinthus with others disguised like messenian soldiers clar you heard the king and the chief lords of sparta wish that no victory might bless our arms till we had sacrificed the traytors life that freed this lion which devours us all  sold we did we did   clar you have also heard twas amalinthas action  sold yes and the king then said his vow should stand and she had died i think had she not fled for it  clar it is true therefore when i reflected on our curse and saw that conquest would no more attend us till we performed what to the gods we swore i moved the king  to let me with your aid attempt the camp which if i found unguarded i would to sparta soon convey the traytress where she should meet the rigor of the law these are the royal tents where she must be therefore no more remains but to secure her they follow him into the inner tent and the concealed officer comes out officer cursed conspiration not to be prevented with but my single arm against their numbers but to the battle and aristors ear i will fly for help that may overtake and cross the bloody purpose exit the women shriek in the inner tent and reenter clarintha etc leading in amalintha and phila amal messenians are ye and yet treat met thus restrain those hands that gave your general to you let me but hear you speak and name the cause which if a just one i will submit to fortune  clar it is but too just and does not ask explaining  amal oh now clarinthus in your voice i read the cruel sentence of an angry father turn not a way that face but hear your princess i cannot resist no force no help is near me therefore command that but my arms be freed and let me not be dragged where i must follow  clar will you relying then on me for safety forbear to cry for help as we conduct you  amal by castors soul i swear it  clar then taking first her dagger free her arms give me your hand and now perform your promise to follow where i will lead you  just as clarinthus is offering to take her hand she snatches philas dagger and then answers clarinthus amal no stay clarinthus that i did not promise my voice and not my feet my word engaged and whilst my hand holds this i will not follow  clar so swift and subtle yet disarm and take her  amal hear me but speak clarinthus my fathers life already i have secured and if you yet will quit this dangerous purpose yours with rewards as great as your desires shall too be given you and all wrongs lie buried  clar more than i love rewards i hate messenia therefore alive or dead will bear you from em he offers to seize her she keeping him off with her dagger kneels amal oh pity yet my youth and wretched fortunes a princess at your feet behold in tears and spare the blood the royal blood of sparta  clar yes and be lost our selves to save a traytress for such you have been to that high blood you have boasted i will not spare nor pity but thus seize you he wrests the dagger from her she rises hastily and followed by phila escapes into the tent clarinthus pursues her and immediately the cries of women are heard enter at the other door aristor and soldiers aristor oh we are come in time detested villains your deaths are all that you shall meet with here they fight reenter clarinthus clar the victims struck which could not be borne off now my next task must be to rescue those who shared the danger he runs at aristor who kills him he speaks falling thoust killed clarinthus and the fiends reward thee  aristor dye and those fiends thou callst on meet thy spirit i asked but that to crown the war we have ended he and his men fall on the rest fighting off the stage enter amalintha wounded and supported by phila amal phila thy hand help me to reach that couch the dying bed of wretched amalintha nay do not weep since it is the fates decree who let one luckless moment interpose betwixt aristors coming and my ruin here set me down and let this last embrace sits down reward the cares and fears my life has cost thee now leave me phila to perform a part which must not be prevented by thy tears  phila thus pale thus faint thus dying must i leave you  amal yes if thou will obey thou must retire but be not far and when thou see me fallen dead in aristors arms who will soon return come forth and tell him twas my last request by all our love by all our sighs and sorrows by our new vows and swiftly faded joys that he would yet survive his amalintha nor let my fatal vision prove a truth that twas my fate my hasty fate that killed him  phila let me but stay at least till he is arrived  amal twoud cross my purpose hark i hear him coming quickly retire and let me hide this stream lest he should swell it with a flood of tears and waste in grief my small remaining life which i design to lavish out in love  phila goes off amalintha pulls her garment over her wound about him let my dying arms be thrown whilst i deny my parting life one groan my failing breath shall in soft sighs expire and tender words spend my last vital fire that of my death men this account may give she ceased to love as others cease to live  enter aristor hastily and sits down by her aristor how fares my love sink not beneath your fears when this most lucky hand has made them groundless securing to my life its greatest blessing your matchless love and all its dying transports  amal its dying transports did you say aristor i would be glad to know that death has transports but are there none none that do live and love that early meet and in the spring of youth uncrossd nor troubled in the soft design set sweetly out and travel on to age in mutual joys that with themselves expire  aristor indeed there are but few that are thus happy but since our lot it is tencrease the number let us not lose a thought on others fortunes but keep them still employed upon our own for in no hearts sure love ever wrought more wonders  amal oh no to mine i gladly did admit it through the stern hazards of a fathers wrath and all the hate of sparta and messenia if ever i wept twas love that forced the dew and not my country or my colder friendships and on my face when lacedemon mourned suspected smiles were seen to mock her losses because that love was on the adverse party thus fond thus doting have i passed my hours and with their dear remembrance will i close my lifes last scene and grasp you thus in dying she embraces him aristor far be that hour but oh my amalintha proceed thus to describe thy tender soul and charm me with thy mighty sense of passion for know twas that which fixed me ever thine when with a pleasure not to be expressed i found no language of my love escaped thee though wrapped in mystery to delude the crowd when every longing look could raise a blush and every sigh i breathed heave this loved bosom which held such soft intelligence with mine and now overflows with a like tide of pleasure  amal oh yes it does it meets the vast delight and takes the thoughts even of elysium from me nor will i as some peevish beauty might take light offense that mine you did not mention since it is my equalling aristors love is all the charm i would be proud to boast of  aristor believe not that i slighted such perfections i saw you fair beyond the fame of helen but beautys vain and fond of new applause leaving the last adorer in despair at his approach who can but praise it better whilst love narcissuslike courts his reflection and seeks itself gazing on others eyes when this i found in yours it bred that passion which time nor age nor death shall ever diminish  amal for time or age i think not of their power but after death aristor could you love me still call to me your thoughts when so far absent and mourn me sleeping in that rivals arms  aristor yes if i could outlive my amalintha still should i turn my eyes to that cold grave still love thee there and wish to lie as low but why does every period of thy speech thus sadly close with that too mournful subject why now i press this question do thou weep yet in my bosom strive to hide thy tears paleness is on thy cheek and thy damp brow strikes to my heart such sympathizing cold as quenches all its fire but that of love oh speak my life my soul my amalintha speak and prevent the boding fears that tell me eternal separation is at hand and after this i never shall clasp thee more embraces her and she starts and groans amal oh of of of  aristor nay if the gentle foldings of my love the tender circling of these arms can wound it is sure some inward anguish does oppress thee which too unkindly thou will still keep secret  amal secret it should have been till death had sealed it had not that groan and my weak tears betrayed me speaks faintly for death which from clarinthus i received is come to snatch my soul from these embraces  aristor oh fatal sound but let me not suppose it till art is wearied for thy preservation haste to procure it phila all that hear me fly to her aid or you more speedy gods the cure be yours and hecatombs attend you but none approach then let me haste to bring it though thus to leave her is an equal danger endeavours to go amal aristor stay nor let my closing eyes one moment lose the sight that ever charmed them no art can bring relief and melting life but lingers till my soul receives the impression of that loved form which ever shall be lasting though in new worlds new objects would efface it  aristor no amalintha if it must be so together well expire and trace those worlds as fond and as united as before for know my love the sword of war has reached me and none would i permit to bind the wound till to thy gentle hand i could reveal it the blood uncheckd shall now profusely flow and art be scorned that could but half restore me  amal oh let me plead in death against that purpose employ my hand yet warm to close the wound and with my suppling tears disperse the anguish your country asks your stay and more your father this blood is his allied to all his virtues by him more prized than what supports his frame nor should be lavished thus without his license oh aristomenes haste to preserve it since life from me departs and love is useless aristor  she dies aristor her fleeting breath has borne far hence my name but soon my following spirit shall overtake her my godlike father gave her to my arms and then resigned to her more powerful claim this purple stream which wafts me to possess her may every power that shields paternal goodness enfold his person and support his sway his dear remembrance take these parting drops he weeps and then be free my soul for ties more lasting eternal love the faithful lovers due in those blessed fields which stand displayed before me my amalintha  he takes her in his arms and dies enter phila phila i should have come and urged his preservation if when i saw her fall my strength had served me but all my cares departed with her life and mine i hope is now for ever going she falls in a swoon at amalinthas feet shouts of victory enter demagetus arcasius alcander and several officers their swords drawn as coming from battle demag a glorious day and warmly was in sought nor ever did a victory more complete stoop to the generals valor  some troops are ordered to secure phaerea and with tomorrows sun he enters there to take the homage of the conquered spartans  alcand they say that anaxander he has freed as generously as he would never known the dungeon  demag he did at prince aristors kind request and now with the high marks of conquest crowned is coming to declare to amalintha that all her wishes and her fears are ended turning to go into the tent he sees the bodies they are indeed for ever ever ended oh turn and see where that pale beauty lies and faithful dead aristor bleeding by her  alcand o sudden horror where is our conquest now our lofty boasts and brave expected triumphs lie there my sword beneath my leaders feet lays his sword at aristors feet for under him i fought and now weep for him  dema well all join to increase the mournful shower a soldier for a soldiers fall may weep and shed these drops without unmanly weakness a sound of trumpets but hark the general how shall we receive him a while well with our bodies shade this prospect and tell him by our looks some grief attends him lest all his fortitude should not support a change so sudden in his wretched fortune nor can we learn from whence this loss proceeds  phila yes that you may from me life yet remains and will admit of the too dire relation  demag then gently bear her hence and hear it from her they lead off phila that when the sorrow which at first must bar all cold enquiries shall a while be past the general may be told to what he owes it but see he enters be we sad and silent for oh too soon this fading joy must vanish they stand all together before the bodies a flourish of drums and trumpets with shouts of joy enter several officers and soldiers the shepherds and shepherdesses strewing flowers followed by aristomenes his sword drawn in his hand and a wreath of victory on his head aristom enough my friends enough my fellow soldiers and you kind shepherds and your gentle nymphs receive my thanks for the perfumes you scatter which yet shall flourish under our protection  shepherds etc great aristomenes live long and happy  others live long and happy father of messenia  aristom now to fair amalintha would i speak the joyful tidings of this days achievements therefore let her be told we wish her presence seeing none move ha what none stir perhaps aristors with her why let him tell it from a lovers mouth twill bear a sound more welcome and harmonious and sure in love and battle none exceeds him the last you all can witness you saw him fight saw the young warrior with his beaver up dart like the bolt of jove amongst their ranks and scatter em like an oaks farshooting splinters will none confirm it this is envious silence walks up and down thou demagetus ha you are all in tears and so are these that make a wall about thee the cause deliver oh declare it quickly  demag enquire it not my lord too soon twill find you  aristom i must prevent it by my hasty search reveal it you or you since all partake it to alcander etc what silent still  if yet ye do not speak ye do not love me i find ye do not since ye all are speechless aristor would have spoke had he been here  demag aristors here but oh he cannot speak you have it now my lord and must weep with us  aristom thy tongue has warned my eyes to seek the center looks down for round this place i dare not let them stray lest they explain too soon thy fatal meaning oh anaxander had such trembling seized me when at the armys head i met thy fury the poorest of thy troops had cried me coward why so we are all there is not a man that is not we all dread something and can shrink with terror yet he that comes a conquror from the field shall find a vain applause to crown his valor though fainting thus and sweating cold with fear pauses and leans on an officer but did thou say aristor could not speak oh that i live to ask it not answer to his father  demag oh never more  aristom the sun will keep his pace and time revolve rough winters pass and springs come smiling on but thou do talk of never demagetus yet ere despair prevails retract that word whose cloudy distance bars the reach of thought nor lets one ray of hope ever dawn beyond it never oh never  demag this passion must rise higher ere it falls divide and let him know the worst to the officers  aristom where is my son my grief has passed all bounds all dallying circumstance and vain delusion and will be told directly where to find him  demag oh then behold him there they divide he seeing the bodies stands awhile amazed and speechless drops his sword then speaks aristom so looked the world to pyrrha and her mate so gloomy waste so destitute of comfort when all mankind besides lay drowned in ruin oh thou were well informed my evil genius and the complaining rocks mourned not in vain for here my blood my dearest blood i pay for this poor wreath and fame that withers like it tears the wreath and throws himself upon his son the ground that bore it take the slighted toy whilst thus i throw me on his breathless body and groan away my life on these pale lips oh of of of  thus did i clasp him ere the battle joined when fate which then had doomed him mocked my arms nor in their folds would let me feel my son oh that his voice though low as then it seemed could reach me now  but the fond wish is vain and all but this too weak to ease my pain he takes the sword that lay at aristors feet and goes to fall upon it demagetus takes hold of it demag oh hold my lord nor stab at once your army all the officers and soldiers kneel alcander speaks alcand we are all your sons and if you strike my lord the spartans may come back and take our bodies for when yours goes our spirits shall attend it they all prepare to fall on their swords aristom would you then have me live when thus unbowelld without the charms of my aristors presence without his arm to second me in fight and in still peace his voice to make it perfect he rises in a passion and comes forward on the stage yes i will live ye sovereign powers i will you have put my virtue to its utmost proof yet thus chastisd i own superior natures and all your fixed decrees this sword shall further till rhodes is rescued and my task completed who knows but that the way to your elysium is fortitude in ills and brave submission since heroes whom your oracles distinguish are often here amidst their greatness wretched but yet my heart my loved my lost aristor  demag let me succeed him in his active duty and join with all the earth to bring you comfort  aristom comfort on earth oh it is not to be found my demagetus thou have far to travel the bloom of youth sits graceful on thy brow and bids thee look for days of mighty pleasures for prosperous wars and the soft smiles of beauty for generous sons that may reflect thy form and give thee hopes as i had of their succor  demag with these indeed my thoughts have still been flattered  aristom then let me draw this flattering veil aside and bid thee here here in this face behold how biting cares have done the work of age and in my best of strength marked me a dotard defeated armies slaughtered friends are here disgraceful bonds and cities laid in ashes and if thou findst that life will yet endure it since what i here have lost  so bowed so waining shall thou see this carcass that scarce thou will recall what once it was then be instructed thou and all that hear me not to expect the compass of soft wishes or constant joys which fly the fond possessor since man by swift returns of good and ill in all the course of lifes uncertain still by fortune favored now and now oppressed and not till death secure of fame or rest  finis
