reasons why the apothecary may be supposed to understand the administration of medicines in the cure of diseases as well as the physician  in a letter from an apothecary to a physician  et herbarum subjecta est potentia nobis  ovid metam lib   london printed for luke stokoe at the goldenkey and bible at charing cross   0   reasons why the apothecary may be supposed to understand the administration of medicines in the cure of diseases as well as the physician sir you have at length found the most effectual means to prevail with me to break through the resolution i had taken of having no share in the present controversy between the physicians and the apothecarys by imputing my silence to the badness of my cause in the vindication of which you are pleased to say no sober or ingenious person will offer to draw his pen  i must confess i have hitherto been of the opinion of the major part of our profession that what has yet appeared in public against us has not deserved a serious answer most of it being taken up on prejudice the rest a scandalous aspersion invented by a peevish set of men who were angry that any body thrived beside themselves  thus then have you unwillingly forced me into a spacious field where on each side i may extend and dilate my self and which way soever i turn may find at least quantum sufficit of matter to work upon  but since you keep a more than ordinary pother with the high advantages which the physicians have over us i shall choose to examine the truth of that assertion and endeavor to set those high advantages as you call em in a true light and then leave the impartial world to judge whether all be gospel which proceeds from the pen of a dispensary physician  and first it is pretended that the phsician by his liberal education that is by being bred at an academy has greater and more frequent opportunities of being instructed in the practice of physic than the apothecary can have and that not only from his own private reading and observation the care and direction of his tutor but also from the public lectures of the physic professor  now if it be expected that this argument should have any force against us it must first be proved what extraordinary benefits those are which young students receive from tutors and physic professors and not think that we shall barely assent to them or believe them to be such mighty things upon their single affirmation i fear when these wonderful lectures come to be examined they will appear little better than barren animadversions on galen hippocrates or some other of the old physical authors which every man is capable of doing who is able to read and understand them and i believe we may venture to add that the auditors of these lectures generally return with the same degree of knowledge and satisfaction as a late assembly did from a lecture at exeterexchange against the circulation of the blood  it is again objected against us that the opportunities of being advanced in the knowledge of anatomy and chemistry so essential to the qualification of a person who is to administer physic are greater in the academy than in any other place and from whence the apothecary is totally excluded  it must be allowed that the understanding the wonderful contrivance and texture of so admirable a machine as is that of the humane body is no ordinary part of science and what undoubtedly the person who administers physic ought to be acquainted withal from which notwithstanding i cannot see how the apothecary is totally excluded since there are constant anatomical dissections at the surgeons hall which is open to apothecarys as well as physicians and where i presume there is more to be seen in one year than the young physician meets withal in six at his academy  the pretended advantages they have over us in chemistry are of apiece with those before mentioned for not to instance our own private elaboratorys the public elaboratory at the hall where all chemical preparations are made in the highest perfection is a sufficient confutation of that groundless assertion  these sir being the principal reasons on which you build your hypothesis namely the advantages which the physician has over the apothecary i shall not content my self with this general reflection on them but shall proceed to examine them more closely and particularly that of studying at the university by which is meant a liberal education as if the streams of polite literature and knowledge were not alike diffused throughout the globe but were scantily confined to the banks of cham or isis  we will suppose then an apothecary who is master of the latin and greek tongues as there are few of them but are to be as duly qualified for the reading comparing and animadverting on physical authors as the academic physician which i think no sober intelligent person will dey if he allows that the greek and latin tongues as taught at westminster pauls etc to be as fit for that purpose as what the young physician generally carries with him to oxford etc  neither will it be disputed with me i think that reading reffection observation and experiment are the only known means of acquiring humane learning and science to all which the apothecary thus qualified has as fair pretenses as the most elevated physician of em all and wherein the apothecary may as reasonably be thought to make as great a proficience provided he uses the same industry and application  it may be objected that although the apothecary be thus qualified yet whilst he is an apprentice he has little or no time for these studys if he had never so great an inclination that what with the duty to his master and the common necessities and expense of life which ask some time to be repaired in spite of us there will be little or none left for any thing else  to this i answer that although for the first year or two there may be little else done yet by that time he begins to have a true taste of the matter and his reason shines forth with brighter rays if he be a youth of any spirit and emulation he will and does find a thousand opportunities of advancing his knowledge equal if not superior to the academic physician  the apothecary then thus qualified may very reasonably be thought to understand the study of physic the natures of diseases and their cures equally with the physician though he cannot boast the high advantages of a liberal education and accademic accomplishments  whilst the physician contends with us after this manner we shall never recede from these principles but if he shall say that the advantages of an academic education are a better foundation for him to set up for a wit a poet or entertaining company then indeed we submit frankly acknowledging that we industriously shun those arts which rather tend to the subversion and destruction of the animal life than its preservation and emolument  if then the equal learning of the apothecary sets him upon a level with the physician notwithstanding his boasted advantages over him it can never be imagined that the composition and administration of medicines by which he discovers their nature and operations will be any hindrance to him in the persecution of those studies which naturally lead him to any inquiry into the structure and economy of the humanedy and the manner how these medicines he prepares operate upon it  this certainly without vanity we may affirm that we understand the materia medica as well not to say better than most dispensary physicians  the world is very sensible what advantages they owe to these modern reformers of physic to whose wonderful penetration we have not yet heard that physic has been obliged for one addition or discovery but that is not their business it is sufficient for them if they can libel the town in their awkard exclamations against the apothecarys by which they vainly imagined to have engrossed the whole art of compounding and vending medicines to the public but alas fond deluded men this knowing age was not to be led hoodwinked to their ruin the town saw through the thin disguise and laugh at the senseless contrivance they knew the abilitys of those persons who undertook the project and that most of em so far from being able to compound medicines as they ought to be scarce knew the distinction between mint and cardus it may be thought perhaps that here i have a little transgressed and gone beyond the limits of truth for that so small a degree of knowledge is sufficient for that purpose that it is next to impossible that even a dispensary physician should be without it whatever may be thought of it i have undeniable proofs of this assertion to produce when ever provoked to it  it is certain that however angry the dispensary physicians may be with us at present they had once a better opinion of our abilitys and understanding i mean when they composed that most elaborate piece the london dispensatory where it is evident they did not understand what they were about by the unaccountable jumble of alteratives and cathartics in the same composition nay nor even the making the composition it self else what is the meaning that we so often meet with vt artis est secundum artum and the like by which at least they tacitly confess that we are the more knowing of the two  since so much has been said of the dispensary physicians it may not be unseasonable to speak a word of their mighty captain and to desire the impartial reader to examine that famous book which has made so much noise in the world wherein the ignorance of its writer is so very conspicuous that we need hardly point at his mistakes  his catalogue of drugs and simples notwithstanding the whole conspiracy labored for its birth is a handsome specimen of his knowledge in the materia medica wherein there is scarce a paragraph which has not some one or more ranged in their improper classes  the senseless remarks he has made on some of the best of medicines show rather the fertility of his spleen than his understanding the which nevertheless he fancies unanswerable by his having taken so much pains to bring quotations from some authors as obscure and splenatick as himself for his vouchers  his spleen and ignorance will be the more remarkable when we reflect on that part of his book where with his wonted assurance he tells his readers that when it shall please the almighty dispenser of all things to afflict them with any malady that they need not be very sollicitous concerning the means of their cure that they have nothing to fear but the lethiferous apothecary that if it should so happen that no dispensary physician be at hand it is much safer to trust to the uncertain event of the disease and the direction of nature or to any thing else though it were but an old woman and water gruel than this bugbear apothecary this is fine jargon and without doubt will be very grateful to a person tortured with a fit of the stone or indeed in any other violent paroxysm or convulsion of nature  it is confessed that nature is most wise in all her productions and that if we will closely attend to her she will never fail to indicate to us the true way by which she would be assisted by us in her labors but this i take to be beyond the power and address of an old woman or even of our dispensary physician himself  to say but one word more of the ingenuity of this mighty author and that is that all the bustle he has made in this matter arose from a private quarrel between him and an apothecary who it seems was a man of too much honor and of too tenacious a temper for the friendship of this worthy physician when these things i say shall be duly considered i make no question but the world will have just such an opinion of him and his performance as they both deserve  since then the apothecary is not obliged to the receipts of the physician for his knowledge in the administration of medicines in the cure of diseases as the vulgar falsely imagine but goes to the same fountain and drinks as large and as pure draughts of knowledge as himself and since most of us are ready to confess that their receipts have been so far from being a direction to us that they have rather proved ignes fatui to mislead us into those errors we have been guilty of in relation to practice  since the present learning and labors of the apothecaries are so abundantly evident in this town that it would be perfectly needless for me to mention them  and since we do and can give reasons equally with the physician of the different operations of medicines used in the cure of diseases why are we thus branded with the opprobrious names of quacks mountebanks empiricks and what not by the mouth of the conspiracy that mighty champion for the cause the renowned dr pit o doctiorum puicquid est assurgite huic tam colendo nomini  it is possible it may be thought by what i have said that i intended to bring an odium on the manner of education as now practiced at the universities and on those learned gentlemen who have been educated there i shall only beg leave to assure those honorable foundations for whom i have the profoundest veneration that i contend for nothing but the bare privilege which our schoollearning intitles us to namely the understanding greek and latin authors as well as the physicians though we have not had the pleasure of being brought up under their benign tuition  and as for those truly learned and worthy physicians who have not departed from their integrity we are so far from the thoughts of interposing in their practice that we are and always shall be ready as it is our duty to recommend and introduce them when ever it is in our power  thus sir have i answered your request and i hope have made it appear as much as the brevity of this letter will permit that those high advantages you seem so fond of are not so unanswerable as you imagined and that in reality they are no more than vain empty airy notions the genuine production of the imagination of a dispensary physician  as this is barely a specimen of what i have to bring against you when leisure and opportunity offer themselves i would desire you as a friend in the mean time to provide your self with a better shield to ward off the blows of your adversary than your boasted advantages are like to prove and withal that you will publish your next that the world may judge fairly the merits of the cause and give the crown to the conqueror  finis errata page    l   read prosecution for persecution
