the cure of saul a sacred ode written by dr brown  london printed for l davis and c reymers against graysinn holbourn printers to the royal  mdccxxiii  the argument saul for his disobedience to heaven is afflicted with the fiend of melancholy p   david is sent for to cure him by the power of music p   he comes attended with a choir of shepherds and as the means of dispelling readiness despair he sings the creation of the world and the happy estate of our first parents in paradise p   to   saul is moved by the representation but expostulates with david why when others are happy he should be miserable p   david to convince him that guilt is the source of misery sings the fall of man and his expulsion from paradise p   this alarms the monarchs pride and instead of reclaiming provokes him to resentment and rage p   david superior to his threats awakens his conscience and terrifies him by singing the fate and punishment of guilt in the destruction of the rebellious tribe of chorah by an earthquake and of the guilty world by the general deluge p  0 saul struck with horror attempts to kill himself p    but being prevented by his friends david sooths his anguish by invoking repentance and divine mercy to compose his passions p    saul relents into virtuous sorrow p    but his despair returning david calls on his attendant choir to raise a more sublime and affecting strain p    this has its effect and saul melts into tears of penitence ib david now comforts him with the return of the divine favor p    to banish the remains of pride he then sings his own happiness in the humble station of a shepherd ib still farther to compose the monarchs griefs by a strain of soft music he throws him into a gentle slumber invoking celestial visions to transport him to the regions of the blessed and change his anguish into joy p    the desired effects appear in his countenance the fiend departs and saul awakes in perfect tranquillity p    david then concludes with a song of triumph on the powers of harmony and the seraphic hymn that attended her as the minister of heaven on the creation of the world p  0  the cure of saul a sacred ode vengeance arise from thy infernal bed and pour thy tempest on his guilty head thus heavens decree in thunders sound shook the dark abyss profound  the unchaind furies come pale melancholy stalks from hell the abortive offspring of her womb despair

the troubled breast whose magic voice can bid the tides of passion swell or lull the raging storm to rest sunk on his couch and loathing day the heavnforsaken monarch lay to the sad couch the shepherd now drew near and while the obedient choir stood round prepared to catch the soul commanding sound he dropped a generous tear  thy pitying aid o god impart for lo thy poisoned arrows drink his heart the mighty song from chaos rose  arond his throne the formless atoms sleep and drowzy darkness broods upon the deep  confusion wake id the realms of chaos shake rouse him from is dread repose  hark loud discord breaks her chain the hostile atoms clash with deafning roar her hoarse voice thunders through the drear domain and kindles every element to war  tumult cease sink to peace let there be light  the almighty said and lo the radiant sun flaming from his orient bed his endless course begun see the twinkling pleiads rise thy star orion reddens in the skies while slow around the northern plain arcturus wheels his nightly wane thy glories too refulgent moon he sung thy mystic mazes and thy changeful ray o fairest of the starry throng thy solemn orb of light guides the triumphant carr

rears his rockencumberd head down his steep and shaggy side the torrent rolls his thundering tide then smooth and clear along the fertile plain winds his majestic waters to the distant main flocks and herds the hills adorn the lark highsoaring hails the morn and while along yon crimsonclouded steep the slow sun steals into the golden deep hark the solemn nightingale warbles to the woodland dale see descending angels shower heavens own bliss on edens bower peace on natures lap reposes pleasure strews her guiltless roses joys divine in circles move linked with innocence and love hail happy love with innocence combined all hail ye sinless parents of mankind they paused  the monarch prostrate on his bed submissive bowed his head adored the works of boundless power divine then anguishstruck he cried and smote his breast why why is peace the welcome guest of every heart but mine now let the solemn numbers flow till he feel that guilt is woe heavenly harp in mournful strain over yon weeping bower complain what sounds of bitter pangs i hear what lamentations wound mine ear in vain devoted pair these tears ye shed peace with innocence is fled the messengers of grace depart death glares and shakes the dreadful dart ah whither fly ye by yourselves abhorred to shun that frowning cherubs firey sword  lo hapless hapless pair goaded by despair forlorn through desert climes they go wake my lyre can pity sleep when heaven is moved and angels weep flow ye melting numbers flow till he feel that guilt is woe  the king with pride and shame and anguish torn shot fury from his eyes and scorn the glowing youth bold in truth so still should virtue guilty power engage with brow undaunted met his rage see his cheek kindles into generous fire stern he bends him over his lyre and while the doom of guilt he sings shakes horror from the tortured strings what sounds of terror and distress rend yon howling wilderness the dreadful thunders sound the forked lightnings flash along the ground why yawns that deepning gulf below  it is for heavens rebellious foe  fly ye sons of israel fly who dwells in korahs guilty tents must die  they sink  have mercy lord  their cries in dreadful tumult rise hark from the deep their loud laments i hear they lessen now and lessen on the ear now destructions strise is over the countless host for ever lost the gulf is closed  their cries are heard no more  but oh my lyre what accents can relate sinful mans appointed fate he comes he comes the avenging god clouds and darkness round him roll tremble earth ye mountains nod he bows the skies and shakes the pole the gloomy banners of his wrath unfurled he calls the floods to drown a guilty world ruin lift thy baleful head rouse the guilty world from sleep lead up thy billows from their cavernd bed and burst the rocks that chain thee in the deep  now the impetuous torrents rise the hoarseascending deluge roars down rush the cataracts from the skies the swelling waves overwhelm the shores just o god

astonished remnant flies  shrink ye rocks ye oceans rise  the tottering cliffs no more the floods control sea following sea ingulphs the ball over the sunk hills the watery mountains roll and wide destruction swallows all  now fiercer let thimpassiond numbers glow swell the song ye mighty choir wing your dreadful darts with fire hear me monarch  guilt is woe  thus while the frowning shepherd poured along the deep impetuous torrent of his song saul stung by dire despair gnashd his teeth and tore his hair from his blood by horror chilled a cold and agonizing sweat distilled then foaming with unutterable smart he aimed a dagger at his heart his watchful train prevent the blow and call each lenient balm to sooth his frantic woe but pleased the shepherd now beheld his pride by heavens

dispell each dark temptation and while he pours the penitential tear o visit him with thy salvation  stoop from heaven ye raptured throng sink ye swelling tides of song for lo dissolved by musics melting power celestial sorrow rolls her plenteous shower over his wan cheek the colors rise and beams of comfort brighten in his eyes happy king thy woes are over thy god shall wound thy soul no more
