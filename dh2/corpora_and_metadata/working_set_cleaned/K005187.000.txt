a dissertation on hermaphrodites  by george arnaud  ancient master of arts and surgery member of the academy and demonstrator of the school of st come at paris herniary surgeon to all the hospitals of the same town and military hospitals of france now surgeon of london   neque indecorum nobis in utilitatem audientium nominare dicata conceptui organa quae and ipsum deum creare non puduit  clem alexand paedag    london printed for a millar opposite to catherinestreet in the strand mdccl  price   s   d  advertisement as early as the year      i read the following dissertation on hermaphrodites at a public meeting of the academy of surgery though it seemed equally to take with the people of the art and the learned of all denominations who honored the assembly with their presence i thought proper however to defer the publication at that time being too young and but just beginning to enter upon the practice of hernias which requiring a great deal of circumspection and a delicacy of manners a work of this sort could not fail of exposing my character to the censure and malice of my enemies it was necessary therefore to suppress it it now has lain by me for eighteen years and would have lain still longer had it not been for some circumstances which prevail with me to publish it  there appeared in london ten years ago a girl of bad structure as to the parts of generation who passed for an hermaphrodite she in that respect imposed upon the curious dr parsons published in english a book entitled a mechanical and critical inquiry into the nature of hermaphrodites this work undeceived the world as to the false notion it had entertained in regard to this creature another sort of person of the male kind and lately arrived here gives room to disputes about his state some affirming others denying it to be hermaphrodital people go still farther and ask themselves whether really there be genuine hermaphrodites or no some pretend there may be others would prove there are none those build on the opinions of authors who have proved their existence these employ the arguments which other authors have opposed to the former from all these reasonings there appear to result but vague and confused ideas which still leave the problem unresolved  my design is not to decide this controversy my only view is to expose the facts on each side which have given room to the disputes that have subsisted for upwards of two thousand years upon this subject i have confined myself as much as possible within the strictest limits i thought that it was better to instruct by amusing than to tire out by instructing in giving a summary relation of the opinions of authors i afford satisfaction enough to the learned the curious will ask for no more to support the opinion of the ancients i shall relate the most authentic observations of our days made by modern practitioners who are still living i have added the history of an anomolous person whom i have myself observed and here i shall obviate an objection which the critics will be sure to start upon this observation they will say it is too long a fault which some persons have upbraided me with in regard to my dissertation on hernias to this i answer that observations can never be too circumstantial and that it is a defect common both to the ancients and moderns to be too little circumstantial in relating of facts and this accounts for our deriving so little benefit from the numerous volumes of observations left us by the ancients why then do not the moderns who expect to be read correct the faults they find in those who have gone before them  to avoid the reproaches that might be made me in regard to the passages which i have been obliged to quote from the latin poets i have softened in the translation the freedom of the original without altering any thing in the genuine sense of the authors  as to the plates which might convey along with them to the minds of some a character of obscenity they are taken from the authors and if there is any difference it is only in the delicacy of the execution a mark of the generosity of the bookseller who has been at that expense  as my design is to enlarge this subject with the greatest number of observations i can possibly collect i take this occasion to invite persons of the art acquainted with similar cases to communicate them in order to their being put together into a new edition of this work which their generosity would encourage the authors will be no losers the public great gainers especially if the observations are accompanied with cuts  those who are possessed of particular facts in relation to hernias are also entreated to communicate them to be put in their proper places in the new edition of the complete treatise of hernias which i propose to publish in quarto next year  london martletcourt bowstreet covent garden may    0 a dissertation on hermaphrodites the introduction whatever degree of accuracy and wisdom nature employs in the composition and frame of the human body we have oftener than once seen her swerve from these and as it were forget herself oftener than once instead of regarding that construction that order those proportions of the organs whence results that perfect harmony which forms the object of our admiration she has exhibited irregular vicious and unseemly conformations of parts it should seem to speak the language of a certain author that this common parent tired out and spent with producing every day the same things over and over in the same order did now and then quit that uniformity and throw into her productions a variety but little conformable to her laws sometimes she withholds from a body the parts the most necessary in another subject she is pleased to multiply them often allots them situations connections and dimensions the most extraordinary and fantastical she separates what according to her own laws should be joined and joins what ought to remain separate hence arise those deformities in the strokes or features those members illarticulated those disproportions those imperfections of organical parts and those combinations so monstrous and out of the common road that it is with difficulty we discover nature even in nature herself among the lusus naturae which are exhibited to us under different forms some are of a peculiar species which cannot fail of exciting our curiosity or compassion and which art can never pretend to correct there are others on the contrary which call for all the attention of the surgeon and in which his understanding and dexterity become of extraordinary use who leaving to the bare speculative physician the painful but honorable province of finding out the mysterious causes his principal concern is to lend a helpinghand to those who are thus disfigured by nature he omits nothing in his power to redress and set her torights again by prudent and skilful operations and sometimes he is happy enough to succeed either by retrenching useless and superfluous parts or by joining those which are separated or separating those which are joined against the order of nature or by laying those open and bare which are concealed and covered daily practice furnishes examples enough to prove that i advance nothing at random but that i may confine myself within the limits prescribed i shall rest satisfied with giving proof thereof by reciting an observation concerning an hermaphrodite after having given a general idea of the different sorts of people of faulty structure of the parts of generation who have been considered by certain authors as hermaphrodites of which others formally deny the existence  etymology of the term hermaphrodite by the term hermaphrodite we understand him or her in whom the parts which form the essential difference between the two sexes are found together either perfectly or imperfectly it is derived rived from the greek  signifying to be made up or consist of mercury and venus in ovid we find the fabulous history which has given rise to that signification hermaphrodite its origin he makes hermaphroditus to be the son of mercury and venus who says he was of so perfect a beauty that the nymph salmacis fell desperately in love with him one day as he happened to be washing in a fountain where she presided enraged for being unable to make him sensible of her passion she prayed the gods to join them together in such a manner that their two bodies should make but one in which however the two sexes should remain accurately distinguished this favor was granted  nec duo junt sed forma duplex nec foemina dici nec puer ut possint neutrumque and utrumque videntur they are not two yet the form is twofold we cannot say that it is the body of a boy or of a girl they are neither though they appear to be both  the ancient poets fruitful in fictions underneath that veil concealed truths which happy geniuses have skilfully unveiled by interpretations either moral or political but the sequel of this discourse will possibly serve to justify those who imagine that the veil which covers the truth in this fable may be seen through for may we not from this fiction infer as m mertru mercure de franc du mois de fevr    0 edit land  who in this agrees with the abbe de bellegarde auteur des explic sur les metamorph dovide edit de la hay       says that  the ancients had a knowledge of the union of the two sexes in one and the same person and that this fantasticalness of nature is the origin of the fiction related by ovid in his metamorphoses  ovid has feigned says the abbe de bellegarde that hermaphroditus was the son of mercury and venus upon the observations of some naturalists who have remarked that the children who are born during the conjunction of these two planets are sometimes hermaphrodites and partake of both sexes  the greeks have moreover called these fort of creatures androgynes a term which seems to be more significant in that it is derived from the two words  which denotes a man and  a woman we however will use that of hermaphrodite as being more common or popular  se affm that aam was an hermaphrodite i will not engage in the disputes of some rabbis who have given out that adam was an hermaphrodite prior to his fall and that he was created with a view to continue in that state on this head may be read gaspar bauhin  aristotles opinion on hermaphrodites hermaphrodites have been allowed of by so great a number of authors that some people have no manner of doubt of their existence aristotle would seem to prove their evidence by the recital he makes of them he relates such peculiarities of them as are admired by some and laughed at by others i here pretend not to fix the judgment of the reader every one is at liberty to settle his ideas according to the extent of his understanding my aim only is to relate the authorities of those who merit our attention i shall neither contest nor prove that aristotle has talked idly or with reason affirmed that some hermaphrodites had the right breast like that of a man and the left like that of a woman and that they changed nature alternately that may or may not be it is what i will not determine nature shows every day singularities too surprising to attempt engaging in that dispute with aristotle  ambrose pareuss opinion on hermaphrodites ambrose pareus who had studied nature like a true surgeon gives much more clear and precise ideas of them than aristotle by the division he has made which at once gives us a true notion he has given us several figures among which is that of two hermaphrodites twins which came into the world joined by the back fig   plate ii  the best authors who have treated this matter since pareus have followed his division as gaspar bauhin who has writ a particular treatise which is very ample and so learned that there are few works in any kind of natural history so full of erudition duval physician at rouen follows also pareuss division the author of the tableau de lamour considere dans letat du marriage has also allotted for them a peculiar chapter considerable and ample enough following also pareuss plan bating a few things he however engages in explanations which are very abstracted and vague martinus schurigius in his spermatologia historicomedica gives very singular instances of them and follows also the division of pareus  these authors and others who have gone before them as hippocrates galen realdus columbus paulus aegineta fortunius licetus and others have undertaken to explain what they imagined might have given occasion to the generation of hermaphrodites those they took for such but what they have left us on this head contains nothing interesting enough to claim our attention and as all i could myself advance could not give half the satisfaction that the demonstration of facts affords as nature lays them before our eyes i pass on therefore to the division of the different species of hermaphrodites  division of hermaphrodites they are divided into four species namely the male hermaphrodite plate i fig   the female hermaphrodite plate i fig   the perfect hermaphrodite plate ii fig       the imperpect hermaphrodite plate iii  besides these four species of hermaphrodites there is a particular sort of persons of bad formation of the parts of generation to which we cannot ascribe any character of hermaphrodite of which plate iv may serve to give a general idea i shall give instances thereof  male hermaphrodite the male hermaphrodite is he in whom the parts of generation of the man are perfect both in dimensions figure and actions and in whom the parts of the woman err through some peculiarities as when the vagina is not open enough to admit the penis and that there is only an imperceptible outlet for the discharge of the menstrual blood  female hermaphrodite the female hermaphrodite is she who has all the parts of the woman fit for generation and in whom the appearances of virility are imperfect this species is characterised by those women in whom the clitoris is disengaged or free for in the natural state though it is indeed considerably swelled in the venereal act yet it never quits its place to become erected see plate iv fig   and which having the same figure with the penis of the man yet without being perforated like it makes them almost resemble eunuchs who can enjoy coition without the perfect consummation of the venereal act the greeks called these women  whence comes i imagine ribaude what the old french word ribaude which signifies a lewd woman such was the famous sappho martial writ the following epigram on occasion of a certain young woman of this species who passed for virtuous for some time because she had never ventured her chastity with the men  esse videbaris fateor lucretia nobis at tu pro facinus bassa fututor eras inter se geminos audes committere cunnos mentiturque virum prodigiosa venus commenia es dignum thebano aenigmate monstrum hic ubi vir non est ut sit adulterium i own bassa i had all along taken you for a virtuous person but o infamous you played the whoremaster and had the impudence to act the part of a man with your own sex and make yourself pass for one a prodigy worthy the theban riddle that adultery may be committed without the intervention of a man  some years ago a girl of this sort was confined at paris because she went about in mens clothes and was discharged out of prison on condition of going dressed like a woman which she did with much regret these sort of women are pretty rare in europe but were formerly very common in egypt and when they were to be married care was taken to cut the clitoris to prevent its being troublesome to the husband aetius and paulus aegineta give the method of performing this operation  the perfect hermaphrodite the perfect hermaphrodite according to the relation of certain authors is where we find the parts of generation of both sexes with both the active and passive power albertus says that there are hermaphrodites who are both incubi and succubi in coition and yet incapable of generating or conceiving wherefore nice and scrupulous authors consider these as imperfect hermaphrodites  the true character of the perfect hermaphrodite they would have the parts of both sexes each in particular to have the genuine character which constitutes their essence for if there are some which are faulty through a vice of action or proportion they accordingly class the subject with the male or female hermaphrodites  the disposition of the exterior parts seems to be of no importance to their faculties and changes nothing in the species it has been observed that in some the parts are placed contiguous to each other see plate ii fig   and   others there are in which they are placed one above the other sometimes those of the man have the first place sometimes those of the woman predominate see plate ii fig   the most natural order but the most perfect disposition in my opinion is that which makes no alteration in the natural situation of the parts as when the penis occupies the place of the clitoris and the two testicles are enclosed in the lips of the vulva as they would be in the scrotum if divided into two equal parts as may be remarked in plate i fig    the opinions divided as to the existence of genuine hermaphrodites the opinions have at all times been divided in regard to the existence of this species of hermaphrodites hippocrates galen licubantius paulus zacchias fabricius ab aquapendente and some other authors knew of no such species and from thence it is they disavowed them in like manner as some philosophers did yet aristotle several historians and some physical authors relate instances of them which seem guarded with all the characters of truth and there is even in the talmud a law for them comprising several articles and from which lawyers have taken their authorities to restrain these people see gaspar bauhin  is it authority tending to prove the existence of perfect hermaphodires every body knows the horror wherewith superstition had inspired the romans against these sort of persons who by the laws of the aruspices were condemned to be drowned some years after their birth because they were considered as monsters by the decree of romulus but in the time of pliny they laid aside that unjust prejudice as he proves by these words gignuntur utriusque sexus quos hermaphroditas vocamus olim androgynos vocatos and in prodigiis habitos nunc vero in deliciis there are persons born with both sexes whom we call hermaphrodites formerly called androgyni and deemed prodigies but now had in great favor  these same romans convinced at length of their error made a law by which those who united in themselves both sexes had the liberty of choosing their sex but if after having made this choice they came to be convicted of having made use of the other sex they were punished with great rigor and severity  iid authority which seems to prove the existence of perfect hermaphrodites another authority which some people urge to prove that the romans allowed of true hermaphrodites is that there was at rome the famous hermaphrodite which polycles a sculptor of great reputation had made there have been others found in marble which are kept and considered as perfect masterpieces and of inestimable value whence they would infer that these rare pieces were made after the life but the figures of centaurs satyrs fauns tritons sirens etc which antiquity supplies us with greatly weaken that proof  iiid authority tending to prove the existence of perfect hermaphrodites we read in history of the cruelties which were formerly exercised in some parts of the indias upon hermaphrodites who from being very numerous were employed in works to which in europe we put our horses  ivth authority tending to prove the existence of perfect hermaphrodites m de rennefort says that at surat there are still many people of that species who with the dress of a woman are obliged to wear the turban to publish to the world that they have the advantages of both sexes  pliny after calliphanes affirms that among the nasamonians and machlyans people of africa there was a great number of hermaphrodites who had mutually carnal knowledge of each other  gaspar bauhin johannes schenkius realdus columbus martinus schurigius and some other physical authors confirm their existence by the enumeration they make of them  divines admit the existence of hermaphrodites in fine tertullian st augustine kugler and other divines of our day have treated these matters so far as they have a relation to good order and the regularity of manners  it is of importance to physicians and surgeons to be instructed in what constitutes the character of hermaphrodites but whatever be in this as it is possibly on the relation of physicians and surgeons that divines and lawyers determine on the species of the sex to which those should keep to whom nature has given faculties so opposite either for administering to them the sacraments or doing them justice in civil and criminal affairs it is in these cases that surgeons ought to be perfectly informed in the structure and relation of these parts which constitute hermaphrodites and that they ought to give a good deal of attention to the nature of the secretions peculiar to these organs without which they would be guilty of very great mistakes by forbidding those parts which possibly might be the fittest for generation in order to allow the action or use of others which might have the least degree of force and the least faculty for that purpose  vith authority tending to confirm the preceding ones in regard to perfect hermaphrodites this examen and the judgment we should pass upon it are of so much the greater consequence as the civil and canon laws are very strict against those who fail in the oath they have been forced to take of using only the sex they have reserved and to which they have been forced to confine themselves for by the violation thereof they are condemned as guilty of the unnatural sin of the flesh which is proved by an arret of the parliament of paris of   0  which condemned a young hermaphrodite to be burnt for having made use of the sex he was expressly forbid  viith authority which supports the preceding ones on the subject of perfect hermaphrodites it was for not having observed with fidelity the law imposed on the people of that species says nicolas venette that the scottish servant maid who had chosen the quality of a woman and who afterward got a citizens daughter with child was buried alive by sentence of judge doctor venette seems to contradict himself in citing this example as he pretends there are no genuine hermaphrodites for how could this creature have been punished like the hermaphrodites who abuse both sexes if she had not been perfectly provided with both or dare we presume to say that in a country where the wisdom of the laws only govern judges would have been wicked enough to pass a decision without the authority of proofs a thing quite incredible  but if divines are at a loss to decide under what kind they should rank the capacity of a subject in whom they find the two sexes how much more must they be so when chance joins together in marriage two perfect hermaphrodites this case is indeed rare yet it happened toward the middle of the last century in the kingdom of valentia viiith authority which seems to confirm in a manner more convincing than any other the existence of perfect hermaphrodites two young persons were married and very soon after they were both in the state of pregnant women they were prosecuted as guilty of the most abominable crime but laurence matthieu a physician as prudent as knowing who was consulted on their score at the moment they were carrying to the place of execution in order to be burnt alive decided in their favor the church having given them the power to be joined together and to make but one body and one flesh here follow his words  tenendum firmiter credo delictum punibile in iis hermaphroditis non reperiri and quoad forum internum opinor quod licite utroque sexu uti poterant virtute potestatis corporum acquisitae per matrimonium cum facti fuissent duo in carne una ad finem naturalis prolis vel ad finem remedii incontinentiae  my opinion is that there is no crime punishable by law in these hermaphrodites and as to the court of conscience i hold they may lawfully make use of either sex in virtue of the power acquired over each others body by the rights of marriage being become but one flesh for the purposes of generation and for remedying the vice of incontinence  ixth authority which confirms the preceding a single instance of this sort would seem to border a little too much on the mavelous if nature which can repeat at one time what she has produced at another did not multiply her proofs we find in ambrose pareus the figure of two twins see plate ii fig   joined together by the back and who both had the natural parts of both sexes exact and perfect in all their shapes and dimensions  isidorus on occasion of the perfect hermaphrodites says vicissim coeundo gignunt and pariunt by mutual embraces they generate and bring forth  but let us remove our thoughts from a commerce which appears so contrary to the purity of manners let us allow that the rigor of the laws cannot too severely punish those who after a solemn oath should bring openly such a scandal to the view of the public which could not fail of being thereby justly irritated and incensed  i wave a great many other instances to be met with in authors by which they seem to prove the existence of perfect hermaphrodites my design as i hinted was not to make a complete treatise on this subject nor to fix or determine the judgment of the reader i content myself only to recite some authorities which seem to establish their possibility a larger work would possibly not be in the taste of the public and the learned would not receive the same degree of pleasure from it as from reading the original authors themselves  imperfect hermaphrodites what constitutes their true character the imperfect hermaphrodites are those in whom the natural parts of both sexes have defects which either entirely suspend or diminish their action this last fort is the less rare but also is that which varies the most there have been of them in whom there was not to be found even any the least appearance of a double sex which however have passed for hermaphrodites such was a sodomite who a sodomite conceives and brings forth by the relation of trallian had conceived and brought forth the same author says that a soldier brought forth at the time that conon commanded at athens because the fundament served as a conduit to the womb just as the vagina does in a natural state  i will not insist on the number of instances nearly of this kind which are to be met with in authors as the one or the oother are not sufficiently conclusive to establish the proposition the following observation clothed with all the necessary characters is a proof if not sufficiently convincing at least sufficiently probable of the existence of imperfect hermaphrodites  is it observation made by the author of the dissertation in the year      a species of hermaphrodite in womans dress applied to me on account of a hernia she said she had in the left groin i found without the ring a small swelling which appeared to me quite a different thing from the disease she complained of she told me she had always been sensible thereof that sometimes it fell down lower and that while it was reascending which was the case from time to time she underwent a great deal of pain i caused the patient to be laid upon a bed in order more particularly to examine her case i at first sight perceived a sort of penis which made me suspect the swelling of the groin might prove a testicle i compared the ailing side with the right where i found a like swelling but which fell down lower i distinctly discovered by the touch that these two swellings were two testicles i was not deceived as to the form of these organs nor on that of the epididymis and the spermatick vessels i was obliged in order accurately to examine the left testicle to pull it a little downwards because cause it was as it were stuck on the ring which never failed to happen when nature was preparing for the expulsion of the menstrual blood this testicle was one half smaller than that of the right side  the covering of the testicles these two testicles were included each in a sort of purse or scrotum these two purses represented well enough the two great lips of the natural parts of a woman the inside of these lips was ruddy strewed with sebaceous glands sufficiently distinct and moistened with an humidity like to that which generally drenches these parts see plate iii letters e f the penis issued from the superior part of these two lips upon removing which the whole extent of that part was discovered it was extremely well formed was about three inches long and four in circumference i could not learn whether this penis was capable of any ordinary sensation either because it was susceptible of no motion or that modesty taught the patient too much discretion she only told me that at the time of the menses it became larger than at other times but without erection yet i understood notwithstanding these reasons that it was very capable of erection because the patient would absolutely have me cut it away by reason said she of the trouble it gave her this trouble in my opinion could be no other than an involuntary spontaneous erection much more uneasy and embarrassing than pleasurable and satisfactory the figure of the penis its structure this penis had the figure of that of a man and appeared consisting of two cavernous bodies an urethra and a glans it was covered with a skin of the same color with that which covered the other parts of the body that skin was plaited on the corona of the glans stretched and extended itself in order to recover it according to its disposition the portion of the skin which covered the under part of the penis was ruddy extremely smooth and interspersed with sebaceous glands which made it moist  the glans and its preputium the glans was well formed and proportioned to the rest of the penis it was not perforated at its extremity but there we observed a small depression which extended along the length of the under part of the penis to its root and terminated at the superior edge of the canal of the urine this depression which had the figure of the indenture of a probe appeared incontestably to be the urethra of the penis sunk or depressed for when the patient made water the depression became filled up and swelled which gave reason to believe that the urine had free access into this canal which being unperforated obliged the fluid to return by the canal which nature had formed for it  this canal was terminated by a hole entirely like to the urinary meatus in women urinary meatus it was situated in the same part it is in the sex and had the figure thereof see letter c of plate iii there was no appearance of nymphae  on both sides of this depression of which i have spoken were very distinctly felt the cavernous bodies cavernous bodies they seemed to terminate at the superior middle part of the ossa pubis  the inferior reunion of the two lips immediately under the inferior border of the canal of the urine was formed reunion of the two separated portions of the purses or scrota which formed the lips this reunion or commissure resembled imperfectly enough what french authors call the fourchette fourchette is the inferior commissure of the lips of the vulva it seems we have no term in english for it  from this commissure to the anus there were about three inches distance which distance was occupied by a portion of lax and softish skin which sunk under the finger and seemed to enter into a kind of cavity none of that seam which is called the raphe was remarked therein but on it was observed much hair as indeed on all the rest of the part and none about the anus  the cavity into which the skin sunk appearance of the vagina when pressed with the finger seemed to indicate that of the vagina which having no orifice suffered not the menstrual blood to run off freely it was obliged to pass every month through the anus by taking the rout of an aperture or canal of communication which probably reached from the vagina to the rectum  a tumor in the perinaeum at the time of the menses some days before the issuing of the menstrual blood by the way nature had paved for it there was a tumor formed in the perineum which increased gradually and in three or four days became of the bigness of a hens egg at the end of that time the blood began to flow by the anus evacuation of the menses by the fundament without observing there any swelling either internally or externally which gave room to think that this blood was amassed by overflowing into the cavity where it was retained till there had been a large enough quantity thereof to be able to gain the height of the orifice of communication which from that receptacle went into the rectum when once it had begun to flow it continued discharging for three or four days it was further observed that the skin which closed up the vagina and which formed a bunch or swelling when the blood was there amassed changed not color  such was the state of the parts when i saw the patient for the first time mess malaval and puzos examined her at the same time with me these gentlemen suspended their judgment and would not determine under what species to rank her without having previously made a particular examen of the kind of periodical flux which she called her courses i know not whether these gentlemen have since been able to inform themselves more exactly  age corpulence and character of the patient and the proportion of the parts this creature was then thirtyfive years old was five foot five inches high had the corpulence of a thin effeminate man had little beard her complexion was tanned or swarthy the skin of her body dingy or brown her voice hoarse and mannish her breast flat her arms dry and musculous the hands large the fingers long and strong the belly flat the haunches large the pubis raised much the buttocks the thighs and legs round the feet small so that she might be taken for a man from the head to the waist downwards but for a woman too from the waist down to the feet bating the parts of generation she employed herself in womens work  the symptoms caused to this hermaphrodite by her bad conformation as this hermaphrodite was extremely valetudinary and complained much more of her bad state of health during the time that the menstrual flux was in a disposition to appear and then was subject to considerable tensions of the belly to violent cholicks in the lumbary regions to yawnings to continual vertigos and frequent syncopes i imagined that all these symptoms to which she was subject from the age of puberty and which had brought her in danger of sinking under them proceeded from the menstrual blood not having liberty enough to evacuate and that necessarily a more easy way must be paved for it by opening the skin which closed up the vagina and by maintaining in that part a suitable aperture many of the most celebrated surgeons were of my opinion but as we agreed to perform that operation at a time the tumor of the perineum should appear the patient went away home some miles from paris and was five or six months gone she told me on her return that being almost brought to the point of death at the times she had had her courses upon her and as the time of having them drew near she thought herself obliged to come previous to her suffering what she then apprehended yet i thought it proper to make my remarks before undertaking the operation on the morrow after her arrival she complained of colic pains fell into swooning fits and faintings could not eat for all that day her pulse was raised frequent and unequal i several times touched the perineum the first day without observing therein any thing more than ordinary the second day i began to perceive a small swelling but the third it became of the bigness of a hens egg without changing the color of the skin the tumor diminished considerably when the patient was abed m de la brunnerie and my father made the very same observations at length on the close of the fourth day we saw the blood issuing out at the fundament in a very small quantity discharge of the menses of a color rather serous than sanguine it continued flowing but in a larger quantity for five days of the ordinary color on the sixth day the evacuation diminished and was quite dried up on the seventh during all the time of the courses we informed ourselves of the state of the fundament where we found not the least appearance of haemorrhoids the most favorable time for performing the operation had been a month after when the tumor was to reappear but the patient could only stay fifteen or twenty days at paris i was then obliged to avail myself of that time of necessity i called together messs de la brunnerie carere guerin the elder morand de garengeot foubert grammont galin and my father all were of opinion after having heard my exposal and examined the parts that i should proceed to the operation  operation in what manner performed i caused the patient to lie on the side of a bed her legs being supported on the knees of two of the consultants who held her thighs asunder i pinched the skin which covered the vagina transversely with the thumb and forefinger of my left hand mr guerin laid hold also with his fingers on the same fold on the side opposite to that which i held i afterward cut that skin with a strait bistory by describing a line perpendicular to the anus at one stroke i came to a sort of cellular texture which i took hold on with a hook and which i afterward cut with a pair of scissars i conveyed my finger into the aperture which procured me the division of the cellular texture it entered without any resistance into a void or empty space which was considered by those of the consultants who put their finger into it as the cavity of the vagina this cavity seemed to us to have two or three inches in depth and about two in circumference i filled it with several tps of lint tied with thread on the following day i substituted for the taps of lint a tent of   inches long and one in diameter on the sixth day of the operation mr verdier and i felt at the end of the finger an eminence at the bottom of the vagina the matrix distinguished by the touch which appeared to us to be the orifice of the part of the matrix which enters into the vagina from the sixth day after the operation the patient was not dressed for twentyfive days that she stayed at paris but with a very large tent made of prepared sponge which was never charged with purulent matter but at the parts which answered to the aperture of the skin whose edges suppurated a very long time i gave pieces of prepared sponge to the patient to use herself some days after getting home the blood of the courses came out at the aperture which i had made for it without a single drop passing by the fundament she had also none of the symptoms to which she had been formerly subject only for five or six hours before the flux she had colic pains like those she had always had upon her the evacuation lasted only three days during which time the patient discontinued the use of the sponge as i had directed her and continued it afterward five weeks after the blood reappeared still by the same part and flowed for three or four days the patient imagined then she might be without the sponge the fistulous orifice that is to say the aperture which i had made appeared to be closed up yet it opened on the third month to give passage to the blood when it was about to reappear this happened still for two months longer but on the sixth month the blood resumed its course by the fundament and all the symptoms to which the patient had been subject before the operation recurred upon her afresh she thus suffered silently without acquainting me for eight or ten months at the end of which time she consulted me i had no other means to propose to her than the same operation but particular reasons hindered the submitting to it  we see by this observation of what consequence the resources of surgery are and that if nature departs from her usual course and forgets herself she may by the aids of this art be redressed and new ways capable of putting her in the state of perfection she ought to have be paved out for her provided the patients have discretion enough to assist themselves and second the surgeons care  the death of the patient the opening of the body the patient died in    0 i was apprized of the day of her death i communicated it to the academy of surgery the academy named m verdier and foubert to make their report m verdier on whom i deferred the honor of opening the body carried home with him all the parts in order to make a particular dissection of them in presence of m foubert myself and some other curious persons who went along with us to the defuncts m verdier made several appointments but kept none of them through an affectation but little decent what were his reasons to behave in this manner and to have made no report to the academy are things quite unknown to me  subjects ill conformed to which we cannot give the quality of hermaphrodites it now remains to make a general examen of a species of subjects to which it is not possible to give any character of hermaphrodite and even sometimes pretty difficult to determine their sex  there are some in whom we cannot easily distinguish whether what appears prominent or sticking out be the penis or the clitoris the part which appears to represent either being the most fantastical and various that can be more or less long or large of an irregular round square flat spiral unequal or uneven figure susceptible of any voluptuous or pleasurable sensation of inflation erection or quite insensible of all there are of them who have a sort of glands which we would be apt to take for testicles did we not more narrowly attend to them others have genuine testicles but placed differently than in the natural state as the subject of which reald columbus speaks who had them in the perineum and there has been seen in london not long ago a man who had them in the same place  iid observation the vagina unapparent is only discovered by chance in some subjects we distinguish not whether there be any vagina or no unless chance make the discovery for us martinus schurigius relates the history of a young woman who arrived to a very advanced age without every knowing whether she had any vagina or no she had occasion to take a glyster but as no one could administer it her surgeon undertook the task he was surprised to find the decoction come out in proportion as the syringe voided it he drew back the pipe and introduced his finger into the fundament and then he perceived that the canal by which the excrements were discharged was larger than commonly the fundament is went also to the matrix whose orifice he touched with his finger  iiid observation the excrements and urine sometimes come out at the vagina this observation seems to confirm what palfyn relates after zaborella professor of phyfick who had a servantmaid whose urine and excrements came out by the vagina this fact is related as a natural accident having nothing in common with the same accidents which happen to certain women the neck of whose bladder and the rectum are tore in hard labor  the urine sometimes discharged byways quite extraordinary there are also people illconformed who though they have canals which seem proper for conveying the urine out of the bladder yet they discharge it by other peculiar passages such was that hermaphrodite of columbus who discharged the urine above the os pubis  ivth observation the menses are sometimes discharged by peculiar outlets nature in some subjects forms to herself peculiar routs for the evacuation of the courses as was remarked in the person of a monk who died at the hoteldieu of paris in      m boudou headsurgeon of that hospital opened the body of this religious the exterior parts consisted in a chink of no great depth ruddy within like the part of a woman the two edges of that chink represented imperfectly enough the two lips of the vulva in one of these two lips there was a testicle in the other none from the space between these two lips issued forth toward the superior part a sort of penis illformed unperforated the urine had been always determined through an orifice situated under the penis at its root in the part where is the meatus urinarius of women these was no appearance of a vagina externally after this examen he opened the belly he found that the spermatick vessels observed nearly the same direction as in the natural state such of these vessels as were of the side of the testicle went to empty themselves into that organ instead of the bladder of that side in the ordinary situation there was a seminal vesicle the spermatick vessels of the opposite side proceeded to lose themselves between the bladder and rectum in a small body which as far as mr boudou imagined was a matrix which for want of use was become collapsed  this religious had an ulcer in one of his legs from whence periodically flowed every month a sanious serosity which made mr boudou conjecture that the discharge which was made by that ulcer supplied the place of the menses  there are in this observation some other peculiarities in which i am not enough instructed they would come much better from the hands of mr boudou himself  vth observation a monk hermaphrodite delivered of a child it is not only in our days that such sort of people are to be met with in cloisters gaspar bauhin relates that in the year      in the reign of louis xi there was a monk hermaphrodite at issoire in auvergne who had the advantage of both sexes he came to be in the condition of a pregnant woman and was delivered of a child at the usual term  mas mulier monachus mundi mirabile monstrum an accurate description of the parts would have given us more satisfaction than all the fine gingle of words in this verse the place also we assign to this history screens us from the reproach that might be thrown out upon us did we put it to the rank of perfect hermaphrodites  these sorts of subjects illconstructed do often impose on the people of the art the most skilled in the structure of the parts and thus it is nowise surprising to find midwives embarrassed who have often taken males for females and females for males because that in these the clitoris is sometimes longer than in the natural state and in those the penis is extremely short and the scrotum folded up in two appears as if divided by a slit of this we find instances in riolanus and de graaf my practice has furnished me with one as follows  vith observation a girl taken for a boy till the age of six years m perrat manmidwife to the queen was consulted for a child of six years old who passed for a girl on a hernia he was supposed to have he devolved on me the decision and the care i found that the pretended hernia was a testicle which gave me the curiosity particularly to examine the scrotum and penis the scrotum was exactly divided by a slit like to that of the vulva this slit was ruddy within and very moist the penis was extremely short and scarce came out of the slit the testicle which was taken for a hernia had begun to come out of the belly but lately and that of the other side had not yet appeared i acquainted the parents with their mistake of the sex which gave them a double satisfaction  viith observation a female african who passed for an hermaphrodite we sometimes meet with conformations still more vitiated which are made to pass current with persons prepared by prejudices dr douglass disabused the public by the description he gave of the natural parts of a female african who ten years ago passed in londom for an hermaphrodite he caused to engrave the plate which mr cheselden has published in his anatomy and dr parsons in his critical inquiry into hermaphrodites this african had all the proportions of body the tone of voice and the ways of a woman two peculiarities only in her parts of generation were sufficient to impose on the simple namely the clitoris and the lips of the vulva the clitoris as may be seen plate iv which i caused to engrave after the original is indeed larger and longer than in the natural state but has nothing to characterise the penis the right lip excessively large compared with the other is with probability supposed by dr douglass to include a hernia of the ovaries it might also be an epiplocele which imposed on those who considered it as a testicle the marking down the urethra which i suppose to be between the nymphae has escaped the accuracy of dr douglass dr parsonss work contains several instances of this sort which he has drawn from authors they all tend to his design namely the proving the opinion he is in that there is no hermaphrodite among men that no hermaphrodital nature can exist in human bodies  nothing is more common than to hear mention made of these sorts of persons as hermaphrodites and the public would for ever be under the illusion if persons of wisdom did not endeavor to disabuse it  viiith observation a child illconformed who passed for an hermaphrodite m faudacque surgeon at namur says in an observation which he has communicated to the academy of surgery at paris that he has seen at three leagues distance from givet a child of eight months old who passed for an hermaphrodite the penis was unperforated both at the glans and preputium he made water by an orifice greatly dilated like a sort of vulva situated immediately under the scrotum as to the rest the penis was says m faudacque disfigured and monstrous resembled a small snail was so curled and bent that the extremity of the glans covered with the preputium touched the posterior part of the root of the penis all the part which answered to the place where naturally is the canal of the urethra appeared to be ligamentous and so short as to bridle in and bend the penis in the manner i have described when mr faudacque saw the child for the first time the testicles were not yet come down into the scrotum but since he has observed them there  mr mertru surgeon at paris ixth observation another boy taken for an hermaphrodite has published in the mercure de france for the month of february of this year    0 the description of the parts of the body of one named michelanne drouart aged about sixteen born at paris in the fauxbourg st marceau the state of this young man to whom m mertru ascribes the character of hermaphrodite leaves no doubt of the species of his sex since he is in london where he arrived four or five months ago the difficulty of finding the cause of the sudden change of his state will justify my silence his countenance his voice his corpulence the proportion of his limbs denote very distinctly the male kind he is a lad who for his age is well built but illformed in the parts of generation of a man which are the only ones he has nature indeed seems to have forgot herself in the conformation of the penis for though of the natural bulk size and figure yet it is unperforated and bent downwards being forced to take that turn by a fold of the skin which extends from its root to the frenum but as nature rarely loses on one hand but she gains on the other she has formed for herself a way at the root of the penis for the discharge of the urine and other excretions we may compare this aperture to the meatus urinarius in women if there is any difference it is only in the exterior figure of this orifice in that it forms a sort of excrescence composed of a simple fold of the skin which is of a semilunar figure this fold forms a cavity about three lines in depth and admits the extremity of the little finger to lodge in it it terminates almost at all the circumference of the meatus urinarius and has the figure of a funnel on removing the two sides of this excrescence we observe in the inferior part a very delicate folding but in which we found nothing to characterize the fourchette this part forms in young women especially who have had no children a perfect crescent and raised much which does not appear in this subject at the bottom of the sort of funnel i mentioned i find a small nipple as mr mertru remarks but to us it appeared to be another vice of conformation it is placed over against the urethra and makes the jet of urine forked the absence of the testicles in the two divided portions of the scrotum holds still to this day but their existence is for that not the less certain since the subject has evacuations of seminal matter of the same consistence and color with that of a man of his age in consequence of the erections which by his own confession procure him the enjoyment of the sex the want of testicles in the scrotum is a defect common to a good many men which hinders not their having a great deal of vigor on the contrary they are much more able for generation on account of the heat in which these organs are kept this manner of speaking though improper ceases not to be understood  i have on this subject a memoir both useful and interesting which i purpose to publish soon as to the menses they have not hitherto appeared and nothing can make me believe they ever can  we reckon then by this report that the subject in question is a lad illformed in his genital parts and incapable of generation xth observation a subject in which the menses come out by the penis the memoirs of the academy of sciences of paris make mention of a sort of creature much more singular and whose sex appears to me difficult to determine  in figure and body in gross it resembled a girl it was baptized by the name margaret the construction of the natural parts was such that no vagina appeared there were however two lips which characterised only the part of the woman from between these lips there issued forth a pretty long penis about eight inches in length when in a state of erection it was well formed but without any preputium there was besides no appearance of testicles the urine and semen issued out as in a man through the canal of the urethra but what was more extraordinary the menses passed regularly every month through the same canal  xith observation an hermaphrodite of a very peculiar sort i conclude with the following observation it must be considered here as out of its place its singularity might entitle it to be ranked under the species of perfect hermaphrodites but as the person who is the subject thereof never had any children and as there is no proof it ever begot any this might be made a handle of to charge us with being inclined to decide too lightly the readers therefore will be left at liberty to give to this subject what character they shall judge to suit best to it  the observation is owing to m gallay surgeon of gargenville near mantes in normandy who has submitted it to the judgment of the academy of surgery of paris  on the   th of march    0 being says he at the village of issou near mantes i learned they were to bury that very day a woman who had passed for an hermaphrodite i arrived at the moment they were about to convey the body into the earth i begged of the husband to allow me to examine her which he granted on condition i should not open her the natural parts appeared to me to consist of the lips the nymphae etc at the superior angle of the great chink where the clitoris should be there was a wellconditioned penis the glans was proportional and covered in part with its preputium was as perfectly crowned as that of a man at the extremity of this glans there was an orifice into which i introduced a probe which entered quite into the bladder from which issued out the little urine it contained this penis was three inches six lines in length and three inches four lines in circumference the urine had no other outlet than by this canal i discovered no testicles the great lips were the parts which should naturally contain them the vagina was placed as usual at the inferior part of the vulva thither i introduced my fingers with their extremities i felt the orifice of the matrix whose edges were hard and as it were cartilaginous the husband withdrew for a moment i improved this time of absence in opening the belly in hopes of finding there the testicles my expectation proved vain i found nothing that had any relation to these parts the ovaries the tubae fallopianae the womb were scirrhous the return of the husband prevented the carrying any farther my curiosity there is room to believe that the penis consisted of all the parts necessary to its actions since the husband assured me that it was often in a state of erection i could not learn whether in that state it had ever discharged any sort of seminal matter as to the rest this woman had had her courses in her youth never had had any children her face was thick set with a beard the tone of her voice was mannish  i here give xiith observation two hermaphrodites in carnal commerce together by way of supplement to these observations the history of two hermaphrodites which are said to be of the perfect kind the one was a young lady of condition the other a religious of the order of st francis who had the direction of the young ladys conscience lust and the devil put it into the heart of the monk to join with his penance a commerce very different from that which his profession allowed of but he paid dearly for his incontinence for after a proper period he brought forth a girl which cost him his life through the hard labor he underwent  the girl who was born of this copulation in a town of italy where the scene of the action lay is now actually living at paris she has given the history of her father and mother and the manuscript which she purposes to publish forthwith is in the hands of a person of my acquaintance the public will then judge what place in our differtation this history should occupy  corrigenda in page    line    for physician read lawyer
