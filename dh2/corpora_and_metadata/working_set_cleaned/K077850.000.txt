additions and corrections to the first and second editions of dr adam smiths inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations vol i page    line    after the words purchase or command add wealth as mr hobbes says is power but the person who either acquires or succeeds to a great fortune does not necessarily acquire or succeed to any political power either civil or military his fortune may perhaps afford him the means of acquiring both but the mere possession of that fortune does necessarily convey to him either the power which that possession immediately and directly conveys to him is the power of purchasing a certain command over all the labor or over all the produce of labor which is then in the market his fortune is greater or less precisely in proportion to the extent of this power or to the quantity either of other mens labor or what is the same thing of the produce of other mens labor which it enables him to purchase or command the exchangeable value of every thing must always be precisely equal to the extent of this power which it conveys to its owner  vol i page   0 line   after the words european market add it must be observed however that whatever may be the supposed annual importation of gold and silver there must be a certain period at which the annual consumption of those metals will be equal to that annual importation their consumption must increase as their mass increases or rather in a much greater proportion as their mass increases their value diminishes they are more used and less cared for and their consumption consequently increases in a greater proportion than their mass after a certain period therefore the annual consumption of those metals must in this manner become equal to their annual importation provided that importation is not continually increasing which in the present times is not supposed to be the case  if when the annual consumption has become equal to the annual importation the annual importation should gradually diminish the annual consumption may for some time exceed the annual importation the mass of those metals may gradually and insensibly diminish and their value gradually and insensibly rise till the annual importation becoming again stationary the annual consumption will gradually and insensibly accommodate itself to what that annual importation can maintain  vol ii page    line    after the words monopoly against their countrymen add the variety of goods of which the importation into great britain is prohibited either absolutely or under certain circumstances greatly exceeds what can easily be suspected by those who are not well acquainted with the laws of the customs  vol ii page    line    dele from the words thus in great britain etc to the words national prejudice and animosity line    and insert as follows thus in great britain silesia lawns may be imported for home consumption upon paying certain duties but french cambricks and lawns are prohibited to be imported except into the port of london there to be warehoused for exportation higher duties are imposed upon the wines of france than upon those of portugal or indeed of any other country by what is called the impost      a duty of five and twenty per cent of the rate or value was laid upon all french goods while the goods of other nations were the greater part of them subjected to much lighter duties seldom exceeding five per cent the wine brandy salt and vinegar of france were indeed excepted these commodities being subjected to other heavy duties either by other laws or by particular clauses of the same law in      a second duty of twentyfive per cent the first not having been thought a sufficient discouragement was imposed upon all french goods except brandy together with a new duty of five and twenty pounds upon the ton of french wine and another of fifteen pounds upon the ton of french vinegar french goods have never been omitted in any of those general subsidies or duties of five per cent which have been imposed upon all or the greater part of the goods enumerated in the book of rates if we count the one third and two third subsidies as making a complete subsidy between them there have been five of these general subsidies so that before the commencement of the present war seventyfive per cent may be considered as the lowest duty to which the greater part of the goods of the growth produce or manufacture of france were liable but upon the greater part of goods those duties are equivalent to a prohibition the french in their turn have i believe treated our goods and manufactures just as hardly though i am not so well acquainted with the particular hardships which they have imposed upon them those mutual restraints have put an end to almost all fair commerce between the two nations and smugglers are now the principal importers either of british goods into france or of french goods into great britain the principles which i have been examining in the foregoing chapter took their origin from private interest and the spirit of monopoly those which i am going to examine in this from national prejudice and animosity  vol ii page    line   after the words insignificant and contemptible add it is in consequence of these maxims that the commerce between france and england has in both countries been subjected to so many discouragements and restraints if those two countries however were to consider their real interest without either mercantile jealousy or national animosity the commerce of france might be more advantageous to great britain than that of any other country and for the same reason that of great britain to france france is the nearest neighbor to great britain in the trade between the southern coast of england and the northern and northwestern coasts of france the returns might be expected in the same manner as in the inland trade four five or six times in the year the capital therefore employed in this trade could in each of the two countries keep in motion four five or six times the quantity of industry and afford employment and subsistence to four five or six times the number of people which an equal capital could do in the greater part of the other branches of foreign trade between the parts of france and great britain most remote from one another the returns might be expected at least once in the year and even this trade would so far be at least equally advantageous as the greater part of the other branches of our foreign european trade it would be at least three times more advantageous than the boasted trade with our north american colonies in which the returns were seldom made in less than three years frequently not in less than four or five years france besides is supposed to contain twentyfour millions of inhabitants our north american colonies were never supposed to contain more than three millions and france is a much richer country than north america though on account of the more unequal distribution of riches there is much more poverty and beggary in the one country than in the other france therefore could afford a market at least eight times more extensive and on account of the superior frequency of the returns four and twenty times more advantageous than that which our north american colonies ever afforded the trade of great britain would be just as advantageous to france and in proportion to the wealth population and proximity of the respective countries would have the same superiority over that which france carries on with her own colonies such is the very great difference between that trade which the wisdom of both nations has thought proper to discourage and that which it has favored the most  but the very same circumstances which would have rendered an open and free commerce between the two countries so advantageous to both have occasioned the principal obstructions to that commerce being neighbors they are necessarily enemies and the wealth and power of each becomes upon that account more formidable to the other and what would increase the advantage of national friendship serves only to inflame the violence of national animosity they are both rich and industrious nations and the merchants and manufacturers of each dread the competition of the skill and activity of those of the other mercantile jealousy is excited and both inflames and is itself inflamed by the violence of national animosity and the traders of both countries have announced with all the passionate confidence of interested falsehood the certain ruin of each in consequence of that unfavourable balance of trade which they pretend would be the infallible effect of an unrestrained commerce with the other  vol ii page    line   dele the sentence beginning half the duties etc and ending subsidies and imposts and insert as follows by the second of the rules annexed to the act of parliament which imposed what is now called the old subsidy every merchant whether english or alien was allowed to draw back half that duty upon exportation the english merchant provided the exportation took place within twelve months the alien provided it took place within nine months wines currants and wrought silks were the only goods which did not fall within this rule having other and more advantageous allowances the duties imposed by this act of parliament were at that time the only duties upon the importation of foreign goods the term within which this and all other drawbacks could be claimed was afterward by   geo i chap    sect  0 extended to three years  the duties which have been imposed since the old subsidy are the greater part of them wholly drawn back upon exportation this general rule however is liable to a great number of exceptions and the doctrine of drawbacks has become a much less simple matter than it was at their first institution  upon the exportation of some foreign goods of which it was expected that the importation would greatly exceed what was necessary for the home consumption the whole duties are drawn back without retaining even half the old subsidy before the revolt of our north american colonies we had the monopoly of the tobacco of maryland and virginia we imported about ninetysix thousand hogsheads and the home consumption was not supposed to exceed fourteen thousand to facilitate the great exportation which was necessary in order to rid us of the rest the whole duties were drawn back provided the exportation took place within three years  we still have though not altogether yet very nearly the monopoly of the sugars of our west indian islands if sugars are exported within a year therefore all the duties upon importation are drawn back and if exported within three years all the duties except half the old subsidy which still continues to be retained upon the exportation of the greater part of goods though the importation of sugar exceeds a good deal what is necessary for the home consumption the excess is inconsiderable in comparison of what it used to be in tobacco  some goods the particular objects of the jealousy of our own manufacturers are prohibited to be imported for home consumption they may however upon paying certain duties be imported and warehoused for exportation but upon such exportation no part of these duties are drawn back our manufacturers are unwilling it seems that even this restricted importation should be encouraged and are afraid lest some part of these goods should be stolen out of the warehouse and thus come into competition with their own it is under these regulations only that we can import wrought silks french cambricks and lawns callicoes painted printed stained or dyed etc  we are unwilling even to be the carriers of french goods and choose rather to forego a profit to ourselves than to suffer those whom we consider as our enemies to make any profit by our means not only half the old subsidy but the second twentyfive per cent is retained upon the exportation of all french goods  by the fourth of the rules annexed to the old subsidy the drawback allowed upon the exportation of all wines amounted to a great deal more than half the duties which were at that time paid upon their importation and it seems at that time to have been the object of the legislature to give somewhat more than ordinary encouragement to the carrying trade in wine several of the other duties too which were imposed either at the same time or subsequent to the old subsidy what is called the additional duty the new subsidy the onethird and twothirds subsidies the impost      the coinage on wine were allowed to be wholly drawn back upon exportation all those duties however except the additional duty and impost      being paid down in ready money upon importation the interest of so large a sum occasioned an expense which made it unreasonable to expect any profitable carrying trade in this article only a part therefore of the duty called the impost on wine and no part of the twentyfive pounds the ton upon french wines or of the duties imposed in      in      and in      were allowed to be drawn back upon exportation the two imposts of five per cent imposed in      and      upon all the former duties of customs being allowed to be wholly drawn back upon the exportation of all other goods were likewise allowed to be drawn back upon that of wine the last duty that has been particularly imposed upon wine that of    0 is allowed to be wholly drawn back an indulgence which when so many heavy duties are retained most probably could never occasion the exportation of a single ton of wine these rules take place with regard to all places of lawful exportation except the british colonies in america  the   th charles ii chap   called an act for the encouragement of trade had given great britain the monopoly of supplying the colonies with all the commodities of the growth or manufacture of europe and consequently with wines in a country of so extensive a coast as our north american and west indian colonies where our authority was always so very slender and where the inhabitants were allowed to carry out in their own ships their nonenumerated commodities at first to all parts of europe and afterward to all parts of europe south of cape finisterre it is not very probable that this monopoly could ever be much respected and they probably at all times found means of bringing back some cargo from the countries to which they were allowed to carry out one they seem however to have found some difficulty in importing european wines from the places of their growth and they could not well import them from great britain where they were loaded with many heavy duties of which a considerable part was not drawn back upon exportation madeira wine not being a european commodity could be imported directly into america and the west indies countries which in all their nonenumerated commodities enjoyed a free trade to the island of madeira these circumstances had probably introduced that general taste for madeira wine which our officers found established in all our colonies at the commencement of the war which began in      and which they brought back with them to the mother country where that wine had not been much in fashion before upon the conclusion of that war in      by the  th geo iii chap    sect    all the duties except   l  0 s were allowed to be drawn back upon the exportation to the colonies of all wines except french wines to the commerce and consumption of which national prejudice would allow no sort of encouragement the period between the granting of this indulgence and the revolt of our north american colonies was probably too short to admit of any considerable change in the customs of those countries  the same act which in the drawback upon all wines except french wines thus favored the colonies so much more than other countries in those upon the greater part of other commodities favored them much less upon the exportation of the greater part of commodities to other countries half the old subsidy was drawn back but this law enacted that no part of that duty should be drawn back upon the exportation to the colonies of any commodities of the growth or manufacture either of europe or the east indies except wines white callicoes and muslins  vol ii p    line ult after the words in consequence of it add it has happened in france as well as in england though in france there was not only no bounty but till      the exportation of corn was subjected to a general prohibition this gradual fall in the average price of grain it is probable therefore is ultimately owing neither to the one regulation nor to the other but to that gradual and insensible rise in the real value of silver which in the first book of this discourse i have endeavored to show has taken place in the general market of europe during the course of the present century it seems to be altogether impossible that the bounty could ever contribute to lower the price of grain  vol ii p    line    dele what follows after the words any reasonable person to the words affected by the bounty line    and insert as follows but it has been thought by many people that it tends to encourage tillage and that in two different ways first by opening a more extensive foreign market to the corn of the farmer it tends they imagine to increase the demand for and consequently the production of that commodity and secondly by securing to him a better price than he could otherwise expect in the actual state of tillage it tends they suppose to encourage tillage this double encouragement must they imagine in a long period of years occasion such an increase in the production of corn as may lower its price in the home market much more than the bounty can raise it in the actual state which tillage may at the end of that period happen to be in  i answer that whatever extension of the foreign market can be occasioned by the bounty must in every particular year be altogether at the expense of the home market as every bushel of corn which is exported by means of the bounty and which would not have been exported without the bounty would have remained in the home market to increase the consumption and to lower the price of that commodity the corn bounty it is to be observed as well as every other bounty upon exportation imposes two different taxes upon the people first the tax which they are obliged to contribute in order to pay the bounty and secondly the tax which arises from the advanced price of the commodity in the homemarket and which as the whole body of the people are purchasers of corn must in this particular commodity be paid by the whole body of the people in this particular commodity therefore this second tax is by much the heaviest of the two let us suppose that taking one year with another the bounty of five shillings upon the exportation of the quarter of wheat raises the price of that commodity in the homemarket only sixpence the bushel or four shillings the quarter higher than it otherwise would have been in the actual state of the crop even upon this very moderate supposition the great body of the people over and above contributing the tax which pays the bounty of five shillings upon every quarter of wheat exported must pay another of four shillings upon every quarter which they themselves consume but according to the very well informed author of the tracts upon the corn trade the average proportion of the corn exported to that consumed at home is not more than that of one to thirtyone for every five shillings therefore which they contribute to the payment of the first tax they must contribute six pounds four shillings to the payment of the second so very heavy a tax upon the first necessary of life must either reduce the subsistence of the laboring poor or it must occasion some augmentation in their pecuniary wages proportionable to that in the pecuniary price of their subsistence so far as it operates in the one way it must reduce the ability of the laboring poor to educate and bring up their children and must so far tend to restrain the population of the country so far as it operates in the other it must reduce the ability of the employers of the poor to employ so great a number as they otherwise might do and must so far tend to restrain the industry of the country the extraordinary exportation of corn therefore occasioned by the bounty not only in every particular year diminishes the home just as much as it extends the foreign market and consumption but by restraining the population and industry of the country its final tendency is to stunt and restrain the gradual extension of the homemarket and thereby in the longrun rather to diminish than to augment the whole market and consumption of corn  this enhancement of the moneyprice of corn however it has been thought by rendering that commodity more profitable to the farmer must necessarily encourage its production  i answer that this might be the case if the effect of the bounty was to raise the real price of corn or to enable the farmer with an equal quantity of it to maintain a greater number of laborers in the same manner whether liberal moderate or scanty that other laborers are commonly maintained in his neighborhood but neither the bounty it is evident nor any other human institution can have any such effect it is not the real but the nominal price of corn which can in any considerable degree be affected by the bounty and though the tax which that institution imposes upon the whole body of the people may be very burdensome to those who pay it it is of very little advantage to those who receive it  vol ii p    line   after the words able to live better add in the purchase of foreign commodities this enhancement in the price of corn may give them some little advantage in that of homemade commodities it can give them none at all and almost the whole expense of the farmer and the far greater part of even that of the landlord is in homemade commodities  vol ii p  0  line    dele from the words orders of people to the words the prejudices etc line    and insert as follows they loaded the public revenue with a very considerable expense they imposed a very heavy tax upon the whole body of the people but they did not in any sensible degree increase the real value of their own commodity and by lowering somewhat the real value of silver they discouraged in some degree the general industry of the country and instead of advancing retarded more or less the improvement of their own lands which necessarily depends upon the general industry of the country  to encourage the production of any commodity a bounty upon production one should imagine would have a more direct operation than one upon exportation it would besides impose only one tax upon the people that which they must contribute in order to pay the bounty instead of raising it would tend to lower the price of the commodity in the home market and thereby instead of imposing a second tax upon the people it might at least in part repay them for what they had contributed to the first bounties upon production however have been very rarely granted  vol ii p  0  line    instead of the paragraph beginning with something like a bounty upon production etc insert what follows something like a bounty upon production however has been granted upon some particular occasions the tonnage bounties given to the whiteherring and whalefisheries may perhaps be considered as somewhat of this nature they tend directly it may be supposed to render the goods cheaper in the home market than they otherwise would be in other respects their effects it must be acknowledged are the same as those of bounties upon exportation by means of them a part of the capital of the country is employed in bringing goods to market of which the price does not repay the cost together with the ordinary profits of stock  but though the tonnage bounties to those fisheries do not contribute to the opulence of the nation it may perhaps be thought that they contribute to its defense by augmenting the number of its sailors and shipping this it may be alleged may sometimes be done by means of such bounties at a much smaller expense than by keeping up a great standing navy if i may use such an expression in the same way as a standing army  notwithstanding these favorable allegations however the following considerations dispose me to believe that in granting at least one of these bounties the legislature has been very grossly imposed upon  first the herring buss bounty seems too large  from the commencement of the winter fishing      to the end of the winter fishing      the tonnage bounty upon the herring buss fishery has been at thirty shillings the ton during these eleven years the whole number of barrels caught by the herring buss fishery of scotland amounted to        the herrings caught and cured at sea are called seasteeks in order to render them what are called merchantable herrings it is necessary to repack them with an additional quantity of salt and in this case it is reckoned that three barrels of seasteeks are usually repacked into two barrels of merchantable herrings the number of barrels of merchantable herrings therefore caught during these eleven years will amount only according to this account to        during these eleven years the tonnage bounties paid amounted to        l    s or to   s   d upon every barrel of seasteeks and to    s   d upon every barrel of merchantable herrings  the salt with which these herrings are cured is sometimes scotch and sometimes foreign salt both which are delivered free of all excise duty to the fishcurers the excise duty upon scotch salt is at present   s   d that upon foreign salt  0 s the bushel a barrel of herrings is supposed to require about one bushel and onefourth of a bushel foreign salt two bushels are the supposed average of scotch salt if the herrings are entered for exportation no part of this duty is paid up if entered for home consumption whether the herrings were cured with foreign or with scotch salt only one shilling the barrel is paid up it was the old scotch duty upon a bushel of salt the quantity which at a low estimation had been supposed necessary for curing a barrel of herrings in scotland foreign salt is very little used for any other purpose but the curing of fish but from the  th april      to the  th april      the quantity of foreign salt imported amounted to        bushels at eightyfour pounds the bushel the quantity of scotch salt delivered from the works to the fishcurers to no more than        at fiftysix pounds the bushel only it would appear therefore that it is principally foreign salt that is used in the fisheries upon every barrel of herrings exported there is besides a bounty of   s   d and more than twothirds of the buss caught herrings are exported put all these things together and you will find that during these eleven years every barrel of buss caught herrings cured with scotch salt when exported has cost government    s    d and when entered for home consumption    s   d and that every barrel cured with foreign salt when exported has cost government   l   s   d and when entered for home consumption   l   s   d the price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings runs from seventeen and eighteen to four and five and twenty shillings about a guinea at an average  the two following accounts are subjoined in order to illustrate and confirm what is said above concerning the tonnage bounty to the white herring fishery the reader i believe may depend upon the accuracy of both accounts  an account of busses fitted out in scotland for eleven years with the number of empty barrels carried out and the number of barrels of herrings caught also the bounty at a medium on each barrel of seasteeks and on each barrel when fully packed years number of busses empty barrels carried out barrels of herrings caught bounty paid on the busses l s d                    0   0 0                        0              0         0       0                 0                                                0                          0            0                              0     0  0                    0                    0 0    0                                                           total        0                     0 seasteeks        bounty at a medium for each barrel of seasteeks l 0     but a barrel of seasteeks being only reckoned twothirds of a barrel fully packed onethird is deducted which brings the bounty to l 0      deducted        barrels full packed        and if the herrings are exported there is besides a premium of l 0     l 0       so that the bounty paid by government in money for each barrel is l 0       but if to this the duty of the salt usually taken credit for as expended in curing each barrel which at a medium is of foreign one bushel and onefourth of a bushel at  0 s a bushel be added viz 0      the bounty on each barrel would amount to l       if the herrings are cured with british salt it would stand thus viz bounty as before l 0        but if to this bounty the duty on two bushels of scots salt at   s   d per bushel supposed to be the quantity at a medium used in curing each barrel is added to wit l 0   0 the bounty on each barrel will amount to l 0       and when buss herrings are entered for home consumption in scotland and pay the shilling a barrel of duty the bounty stands thus to wit as before l 0      from which the   s a barrel is to be deducted 0   0 0      but to that there is to be added again the duty of the foreign salt used in curing a barrel of herrings viz 0      so that the premium allowed for each barrel of herrings entered for home consumption is l       if the herrings are cured with british salt it will stand as follows viz bounty on each barrel brought in by the busses as above l 0      from which deduct the   s a barrel paid at the time they are entered for home consumption 0   0 l 0      but if to the bounty the duty on two bushels of scots salt at   s   d per bushel supposed to be the quantity at a medium used in curing each barrel is added to wit 0   0 the premium for each barrel entered for home consumption will be l 0       though the loss of duties upon herrings exported cannot perhaps properly be considered as bounty that upon herrings entered for home consumption certainly may  an account of the quantity of foreign salt imported into scotland and of scots salt delivered duty free from the works there for the fishery from the  th of april      to the  th of april      with a medium of both for one year period foreign salt imported scots salt delivered from the works bushels bushels from the  th of april      to the  th of april                    medium for one year                      it is to be observed that the bushel of foreign salt weighs    lb that of british salt    lb only  secondly the bounty to the white herring fishery is a tonnage bounty and is proportioned to the burden of the ship not to her diligence or success in the fishery and it has i am afraid been too common for vessels to fit out for the sole purpose of catching not the fish but the bounty in the year      when the bounty was at fifty shillings the ton the whole buss fishery of scotland brought in only four barrels of seasteeks in that year each barrel of seasteeks cost government in bounties alone     l    s each barrel of merchantable herrings     l   s   d  thirdly the mode of fishing for which this tonnage bounty in the white herring fishery has been given by busses or decked vessels from twenty to eighty tons burden seems not so well adapted to the situation of scotland as to that of holland from the practice of which country it appears to have been borrowed holland lies at a great distance from the seas to which herrings are known principally to resort and can therefore carry on that fishery only in decked vessels which can carry water and provisions sufficient for a voyage to a distant sea but the hebrides or western islands the islands of shetland and the northern and northwestern coasts of scotland the countries in whose neighborhood the herring fishery is principally carried on are every where intersected by arms of the sea which run up a considerable way into the land and which in the language of the country are called sealochs it is to these sealochs that the herrings principally resort during the seasons in which they visit those seas for the visits of this and i am assured of many other sorts of fish are not quite regular and constant a boat fishery therefore seems to be the mode of fishing best adapted to the peculiar situation of scotland the fishers carrying the herrings on shore as fast as they are taken to be either cured or consumed fresh but the great encouragement which a bounty of thirty shillings the ton gives to the buss fishery is necessarily a discouragement to the boat fishery which having no such bounty cannot bring its cured fish to market upon the same terms as the buss fishery the boatfishery accordingly which before the establishment of the buss bounty was very considerable and is said to have employed a number of seamen not inferior to what the buss fishery employs at present is now gone almost entirely to decay of the former extent however of this now ruined and abandoned fishery i must acknowledge that i cannot pretend to speak with much precision as no bounty was paid upon the outfit of the boatfishery no account was taken of it by the officers of the customs or salt duties  fourthly in many parts of scotland during certain seasons of the year herrings make no inconsiderable part of the food of the common people a bounty which tended to lower their price in the home market might contribute a good deal to the relief of a great number of our fellow subjects whose circumstances are by no means affluent but the herring buss bounty contributes to no such good purpose it has ruined the boat fishery which is by far the best adapted for the supply of the home market and the additional bounty of   s   d the barrel upon exportation carries the greater part more than twothirds of the produce of the buss fishery abroad between thirty and forty years ago before the establishment of the buss bounty sixteen shillings the barrel i have been assured was the common price of white herrings between ten and fifteen years ago before the boat fishery was entirely ruined the price is said to have run from seventeen to twenty shillings the barrel for these last five years it has at an average been at twentyfive shillings the barrel this high price however may have been owing to the real scarcity of the herrings upon the coast of scotland i must observe too that the cask or barrel which is usually sold with the herrings and of which the price is included in all the foregoing prices has since the commencement of the american war risen to about double its former price or from about three shillings to about six shillings i must likewise observe that the accounts i have received of the prices of former times have been by no means quite uniform and consistent and an old man of great accuracy and experience has assured me that more than fifty years ago a guinea was the usual price of a barrel of good merchantable herrings and this i imagine may still be looked upon as the average price all accounts however i think agree that the price has not been lowered in the home market in consequence of the buss bounty  when the undertakers of fisheries after such liberal bounties have been bestowed upon them continue to sell their commodity at the same or even at a higher price than they were accustomed to do before it might be expected that their profits should be very great and it is not improbable that those of some individuals may have been so in general however i have every reason to believe they have been quite otherwise the usual effect of such bounties is to encourage rash undertakers to adventure in a business which they do not understand and what they lose by their own negligence and ignorance more than compensates all that they can gain by the utmost liberality of government in    0 by the same act which first gave the bounty of thirty shillings the ton for the encouragement of the white herring fishery the    geo ii chap    a joint stock company was erected with a capital of five hundred thousand pounds to which the subscribers over and above all other encouragements the tonnage bounty just now mentioned the exportation bounty of two shillings and eight pence the barrel the delivery of both british and foreign salt duty free were during the space of fourteen years for every hundred pounds which they subscribed and paid in to the stock of the society entitled to three pounds a year to be paid by the receivergeneral of the customs in equal halfyearly payments besides this great company the residence of whose governor and directors was to be in london it was declared lawful to erect different fishingchambers in all the different outports of the kingdom provided a sum not less than ten thousand pounds was subscribed into the capital of each to be managed at its own risk and for its own profit and loss the same annuity and the same encouragement of all kinds were given to the trade of those inferior chambers as to that of the great company the subscription of the great company was soon filled up and several different fishingchambers were erected in the different outports of the kingdom in spite of all these encouragements almost all those different companies both great and small lost either the whole or the greater part of their capitals scarce a vestige now remains of any of them and the white herring fishery is now entirely or almost entirely carried on by private adventurers  if any particular manufacture was necessary indeed for the defense of the society it might not always be prudent to depend upon our neighbors for the supply and if such manufacture could not otherwise be supported at home it might not be unreasonable that all the other branches of industry should be taxed in order to support it the bounties upon the exportation of britishmade sailcloth and britishmade gunpowder may perhaps both be vindicated upon this principle  but though it can very seldom be reasonable to tax the industry of the great body of the people in order to support that of some particular class of manufacturers yet in the wantonness of great prosperity when the public enjoys a greater revenue than it knows well what to do with to give such bounties to favorite manufactures may perhaps be as natural as to incur any other idle expense in public as well as in private expenses great wealth may perhaps frequently be admitted as an apology for great folly but there must surely be something more than ordinary absurdity in continuing such profusion in times of general difficulty and distress  vol ii p     line ult after the words under their government insert the following chapter chap viii  conclusion of the mercantile system  though the encouragement of exportation and the discouragement of importation are the two great engines by which the mercantile system proposes to enrich every country yet with regard to some particular commodities it seems to follow an opposite plan to discourage exportation and to encourage importation its ultimate object however it pretends is always the same to enrich the country by an advantageous balance of trade it discourages the exportation of the materials of manufacture and of the instruments of trade in order to give our own workmen an advantage and to enable them to undersell those of other nations in all foreign markets and by restraining in this manner the exportation of a few commodities of no great price it proposes to occasion a much greater and more valuable exportation of others it encourages the importation of the materials of manufacture in order that our own people may be enabled to work them up more cheaply and thereby prevent a greater and more valuable importation of the manufactured commodities i do not observe at least in our statute book any encouragement given to the importation of the instruments of trade when manufactures have advanced to a certain pitch of greatness the fabrication of the instruments of trade becomes itself the object of a great number of very important manufactures to give any particular encouragement to the importation of such instruments would interfere too much with the interest of those manufactures such importation therefore instead of being encouraged has frequently been prohibited thus the importation of wool cards except from ireland or when brought in as wreck or prize goods was prohibited by the  d of edward iv which prohibition was renewed by the   th of elizabeth and has been continued and rendered perpetual by subsequent laws  the importation of the materials of manufacture has sometimes been encouraged by an exemption from the duties to which other goods are subject and sometimes by bounties  the importation of sheeps wool from several different countries of cotton wool from all countries of undressed flax of the greater part of dying drugs of the greater part of undressed hides from ireland or the british colonies of seal skins from the british greenland fishery of pig and bar iron from the british colonies as well as of several other materials of manufacture has been encouraged by an exemption from all duties if properly entered at the customhouse the private interest of our merchants and manufacturers may perhaps have extorted from the legislature these exemptions as well as the greater part of our other commercial regulations they are however perfectly just and reasonable and if consistently with the necessities of the state they could be extended to all the other materials of manufacture the public would certainly be a gainer  the avidity of our great manufacturers however has in some cases extended these exemptions a good deal beyond what can justly be considered as the rude materials of their work by the    geo ii chap    a small duty of only one penny the pound was imposed upon the importation of foreign brown linen yarn instead of much higher duties to which it had been subjected before viz of sixpence the pound upon sail yarn of one shilling the pound upon all french and dutch yarn and of two pounds thirteen shillings and four pence upon the hundred weight of all spruce or muscovia yarn but our manufacturers were not long satisfied with this reduction by the   th of the same king chap    the same law which gave a bounty upon the exportation of british and irish linen of which the price did not exceed eighteen pence the yard even this small duty upon the importation of brown linen yarn was taken away in the different operations however which are necessary for the preparation of linen yarn a good deal more industry is employed than in the subsequent operation of preparing linen cloth from linen yarn to say nothing of the industry of the flaxgrowers and flaxdressers three or four spinners at least are necessary in order to keep one weaver in constant employment and more than fourfifths of the whole quantity of labor necessary for the preparation of linen cloth is employed in that of linen yarn but our spinners are poor people women commonly scattered about in all different parts of the country without support or protection it is not by the sale of their work but by that of the complete work of the weavers that our great master manufacturers make their profits as it is their interest to sell the complete manufacture as dear so is it to buy the materials as cheap as possible by extorting from the legislature bounties upon the exportation of their own linen high duties upon the importation of all foreign linen and a total prohibition of the home consumption of some sorts of french linen they endeavor to sell their own goods as dear as possible by encouraging the importation of foreign linen yarn and thereby bringing it into competition with that which is made by our own people they endeavor to buy the work of the poor spinners as cheap as possible they are as intent to keep down the wages of their own weavers as the earnings of the poor spinners and it is by no means for the benefit of the workman that they endeavor either to raise the price of the complete work or to lower that of the rude materials it is the industry which is carried on for the benefit of the rich and the powerful that is principally encouraged by our mercantile system that which is carried on for the benefit of the poor and the indigent is too often either neglected or oppressed  both the bounty upon the exportation of linen and the exemption from duty upon the importation of foreign yarn which were granted only for fifteen years but continued by two different prolongations expire with the end of the session of parliament which shall immediately follow the   th of june       the encouragement given to the importation of the materials of manufacture by bounties has been principally confined to such as were imported from our american plantations  the first bounties of this kind were those granted about the beginning of the present century upon the importation of naval stores from america under this denomination were comprehended timber fit for masts yards and bowsprits hemp tar pitch and turpentine the bounty however of one pound the ton upon mastingtimber and that of six pounds the ton upon hemp were extended to such as should be imported into england from scotland both these bounties continued without any variation at the same rate till they were severally allowed to expire that upon hemp on the  st of january      and that upon mastingtimber at the end of the session of parliament immediately following the   th june       the bounties upon the importation of tar pitch and turpentine underwent during their continuance several alterations originally that upon tar was four pounds the ton that upon pitch the same and that upon turpentine three pounds the ton the bounty of four pounds the ton upon tar was afterward confined to such as had been prepared in a particular manner that upon other good clean and merchantable tar was reduced to two pounds four shillings the ton the bounty upon pitch was likewise reduced to one pound and that upon turpentine to one pound ten shillings the ton  the second bounty upon the importation of any of the materials of manufacture according to the order of time was that granted by the    geo ii chap  0 upon the importation of indigo from the british plantations when the plantation indigo was worth threefourths of the price of the best french indigo it was by this act entitled to a bounty of sixpence the pound this bounty which like most others was granted only for a limited time was continued by several prolongations but was reduced to four pence the pound it was allowed to expire with the end of the session of parliament which followed the   th march       the third bounty of this kind was that granted much about the time that we were beginning sometimes to court and sometimes to quarrel with our american colonies by the   geo iii chap    upon the importation of hemp or undressed flax from the british plantations this bounty was granted for twentyone years from the   th june      to the   th june      for the first seven years it was to be at the rate of eight pounds the ton for the second at six pounds and for the third at four pounds it was not extended to scotland of which the climate although hemp is sometimes raised there in small quantities and of an inferior quality is not very fit for that produce such a bounty upon the importation of scotch flax into england would have been too great a discouragement to the native produce of the southern part of the united kingdom  the fourth bounty of this kind was that granted by the   geo iii chap    upon the importation of wood from america it was granted for nine years from the  st january      to the  st january      during the first three years it was to be for every hundred and twenty good deals at the rate of one pound and for every load containing fifty cubic feet of other squared timber at the rate of twelve shillings for the second three years it was for deals to be at the rate of fifteen shillings and for other squared timber at the rate of eight shillings and for the third three years it was for deals to be at the rate of ten shillings and for other squared timber at the rate of five shillings  the fifth bounty of this kind was that granted by the   geo iii chap    upon the importation of raw silk from the british plantations it was granted for twentyone years from the  st january    0 to the  st january      for the first seven years it was to be at the rate of twentyfive pounds for every hundred pounds value for the second at twenty pounds and for the third at fifteen pounds the management of the silkworm and the preparation of silk requires so much hand labor and labor is so very dear in america that even this great bounty i have been informed was not likely to produce any considerable effect  the sixth bounty of this kind was that granted by    geo iii chap  0 for the importation of pipe hogshead and barrel staves and heading from the british plantations it was granted for nine years from  st january      to the  st january      for the first three years it was for a certain quantity of each to be at the rate of six pounds for the second three years at four pounds and for the third three years at two pounds  the seventh and last bounty of this kind was granted by the    geo iii chap    upon the importation of hemp from ireland it was granted in the same manner as that for the importation of hemp and undressed flax from america for twentyone years from the   th june      to the   th june   00 this term is divided likewise into three periods of seven years each and in each of those periods the rate of the irish bounty is the same with that of the american it does not however like the american bounty extend to the importation of undressed flax it would have been too great a discouragement to the cultivation of that plant in great britain when this last bounty was granted the british and irish legislatures were not in much better humor with one another than the british and american had been before but this boon to ireland it is to be hoped has been granted under more fortunate auspices than all those to america  the same commodities upon which we thus gave bounties when imported from america were subjected to considerable duties when imported from any other country the interest of our american colonies was regarded as the same with that of the mother country their wealth was considered as our wealth whatever money was sent out to them it was said came all back to us by the balance of trade and we could never become a farthing the poorer by any expense which we could lay out upon them they were our own in every respect and it was an expense laid out upon the improvement of our own property and for the profitable employment of our own people it is unnecessary i apprehend at present to say any thing further in order to expose the folly of a system which fatal experience has now sufficiently exposed had our american colonies really been a part of great britain those bounties might have been considered as bounties upon production and would still have been liable to all the objections to which such bounties are liable but to no other  the exportation of the materials of manufacture is sometimes discouraged by absolute prohibitions and sometimes by high duties  our woollen manufacturers have been more successful than any other class of workmen in persuading the legislature that the prosperity of the nation depended upon the success and extension of their particular business they have not only obtained a monopoly against the consumers by an absolute prohibition of importing woollen cloths from any foreign country but they have likewise obtained another monopoly against the sheep farmers and growers of wool by a similar prohibition of the exportation of live sheep and wool the severity of many of the laws which have been enacted for the security of the revenue is very justly complained of as imposing heavy penalties upon actions which antecedent to the statutes that declared them to be crimes had always been understood to be innocent but the cruellest of our revenue laws i will venture to affirm are mild and gentle in comparison of some of those which the clamor of our merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the legislature for the support of their own absurd and oppressive monopolies like the laws of draco these laws may be said to be all written in blood  by the  th of elizabeth chap   the exporter of sheep lambs or rams was for the first offense to forfeit all his goods for ever to suffer a years imprisonment and then to have his left hand cut off in a market town upon a market day to be there nailed up and for the second offense to be adjudged a felon and to suffer death accordingly to prevent the breed of our sheep from being propagated in foreign countries seems to have been the object of this law by the   th and   th of charles ii chap    the exportation of wool was made felony and the exporter subjected to the same penalties and forfeitures as a felon  for the honor of the national humanity it is to be hoped that neither of these statutes were ever executed the first of them however so far as i know has never been directly repealed and sergeant hawkins seems to consider it as still in force it may however perhaps be considered as virtually repealed by the   th of charles ii chap    sect   which without expressly taking away the penalties imposed by former statutes imposes a new penalty viz that of twenty shillings for every sheep exported or attempted to be exported together with the forfeiture of the sheep and of the owners share of the ship the second of them was expressly repealed by the  th and  th of william iii chap    sect   by which it is declared that whereas the statute of the   th and   th of king charles ii made against the exportation of wool among other things in the said act mentioned does enact the same to be deemed felony by the severity of which penalty the prosecution of offenders has not been so effectually put in execution be it therefore enacted by the authority foresaid that so much of the said act which relates to the making the said offense felony be repealed and made void  the penalties however which are either imposed by this milder statute or which though imposed by former statutes are not repealed by this one are still sufficiently severe besides the forfeiture of the goods the exporter incurs the penalty of three shillings for every pound weight of wool either exported or attempted to be exported that is about four or five times the value any merchant or other person convicted of this offense is disabled from requiring any debt or account belonging to him from any factor or other person let his fortune be what it will whether he is or is not able to pay those heavy penalties the law means to ruin him completely but as the morals of the great body of the people are not yet so corrupt as those of the contrivers of this statute i have not heard that any advantage has ever been taken of this clause if the person convicted of this offense is not able to pay the penalties within three months after judgment he is to be transported for seven years and if he returns before the expiration of that term he is liable to the pains of felony without benefit of clergy the owner of the ship knowing this offense forfeits all his interest in the ship and furniture the master and mariners knowing this offense forfeit all their goods and chattels and suffer three months imprisonment by a subsequent statute the master suffers six months imprisonment  in order to prevent exportation the whole inland commerce of wool is laid under very burdensome and oppressive restrictions it cannot be packed in any box barrel cask case chest or any other package but only in packs of leather or packcloth on which must be marked on the outside the words wool or yarn in large letters not less than three inches long on pain of forfeiting the same and the package and three shillings for every pound weight to be paid by the owner or packer it cannot be laden on any horse or cart or carried by land within five miles of the coast but between sunrising and sunsetting on pain of forfeiting the same the horses and carriages the hundred next adjoining to the sea coast out of or through which the wool is carried or exported forfeits twenty pounds if the wool is under the value of ten pounds and if of greater value then treble that value together with treble costs to be sued for within the year the execution to be against any two of the inhabitants whom the sessions must reimburse by an assessment on the other inhabitants as in the cases of robbery and if any person compounds with the hundred for less than this penalty he is to be imprisoned for five years and any other person may prosecute these regulations take place through the whole kingdom  but in the particular counties of kent and sussex the restrictions are still more troublesome every owner of wool within ten miles of the seacoast must give an account in writing three days after shearing to the next officer of the customs of the number of his fleeces and of the places where they are lodged and before he removes any part of them he must give the like notice of the number and weight of the fleeces and of the name and abode of the person to whom they are sold and of the place to which it is intended they should be carried no person within fifteen miles of the sea in the said counties can buy any wool before he enters into bond to the king that no part of the wool which he shall so buy shall be sold by him to any other person within fifteen miles of the sea if any wool is found carrying toward the seaside in the said counties unless it has been entered and security given as aforesaid it is forfeited and the offender also forfeits three shillings for every pound weight if any person lays any wool not entered as aforesaid within fifteen miles of the sea it must be seized and forfeited and if after such seizure any person shall claim the same he must give security to the exchequer that if he is cast upon trial he shall pay treble costs besides all other penalties  when such restrictions are imposed upon the inland trade the coasting trade we may believe cannot be left very free every owner of wool who carries or causes to be carried any wool to any port or place on the seacoast in order to be from thence transported by sea to any other place or port on the coast must first cause an entry thereof to be made at the port from whence it is intended to be conveyed containing the weight marks and number of the packages before he brings the same within five miles of that port on pain of forfeiting the same and also the horses carts and other carriages and also of suffering and forfeiting as by the other laws in force against the exportation of wool this law however   will iii chap    is so very indulgent as to declare that this shall not hinder any person from carrying his wool home from the place of shearing though it be within five miles of the sea provided that in ten days after shearing and before he remove the wool he do under his hand certify to the next officer of the customs the true number of fleeces and where it is housed and do not remove the same without certifying to such officer under his hand his intention so to do three days before bond must be given that the wool to be carried coastways is to be landed at the particular port for which it is entered outward and if any part of it is landed without the presence of an officer not only the forfeiture of the wool is incurred as in other goods but the usual additional penalty of three shillings for every pound weight is likewise incurred  our woollen manufacturers in order to justify their demand of such extraordinary restrictions and regulations confidently asserted that english wool was of a peculiar quality superior to that of any other country that the wool of other countries could not without some mixture of it be wrought up into any tolerable manufacture that fine cloth could not be made without it that england therefore if the exportation of it could be totally prevented could monopolize to herself almost the whole woollen trade of the world and thus having no rivals could sell at what price she pleased and in a short time acquire the most incredible degree of wealth by the most advantageous balance of trade this doctrine like most other doctrines which are confidently asserted by any considerable number of people was and still continues to be most implicitly believed by a much greater number by almost all those who are either unacquainted with the woollen trade or who have not made particular inquiries it is however so perfectly false that english wool is in any respect necessary for the making of fine cloth that it is altogether unfit for it fine cloth is made altogether of spanish wool english wool cannot be even so mixed with spanish wool as to enter into the composition without spoiling and degrading in some degree the fabric of the cloth  it has been shown in the foregoing part of this work that the effect of these regulations has been to depress the price of english wool not only below what it naturally would be in the present times but very much below what it actually was in the time of edward iii the price of scots wool when in consequence of the union it became subject to the same regulations is said to have fallen about one half it is observed by the very accurate and intelligent author of the memoirs of wool the reverend mr john smith that the price of the best english wool in england is generally below what wool of a very inferior quality commonly sells for in the market of amsterdam to depress the price of this commodity below what may be called its natural and proper price was the avowed purpose of those regulations and there seems to be no doubt of their having produced the effect that was expected from them  this reduction of price it may perhaps be thought by discouraging the growing of wool must have reduced very much the annual produce of that commodity though not below what it formerly was yet below what in the present state of things it probably would have been had it in consequence of an open and free market been allowed to rise to the natural and proper price i am however disposed to believe that the quantity of the annual produce cannot have been much though it may perhaps have been a little affected by these regulations the growing of wool is not the chief purpose for which the sheep farmer employs his industry and stock he expects his profit not so much from the price of the the fleece as from that of the carcass and the average or ordinary price of the latter must even in many cases make up to him whatever deficiency there may be in the average or ordinary price of the former it has been observed in the foregoing part of this work that whatever regulations tend to sink the price either of wool or of raw hides below what it naturally would be must in an improved and cultivated country have some tendency to raise the price of butchers meat the price both of the great and small cattle which are fed on improved and cultivated land must be sufficient to pay the rent which the landlord and the profit which the farmer has reason to expect from improved and cultivated land if it is not they will soon cease to feed them whatever part of this price therefore is not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid by the carcass the less there is paid for the one the more must be paid for the other in what manner this price is to be divided upon the different parts of the beast is indifferent to the landlords and farmers provided it is all paid to them in an improved and cultivated country therefore their interest as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such regulations though their interest as consumers may by the rise in the price of provisions according to this reasoning therefore this degradation in the price of wool is not likely in an improved and cultivated country to occasion any diminution in the annual produce of that commodity except so far as by raising the price of mutton it may somewhat diminish the demand for and consequently the production of that particular species of butchers meat its effect however even in this way it is probable is not very considerable  but though its effect upon the quantity of the annual produce may not have been very considerable its effect upon the quality it may perhaps be thought must necessarily have been very great the degradation in the quality of english wool if not below what it was in former times yet below what it naturally would have been in the present state of improvement and cultivation must have been it may perhaps be supposed very nearly in proportion to the degradation of price as the quality depends upon the breed upon the pasture and upon the management and cleanliness of the sheep during the whole progress of the growth of the fleece the attention to these circumstances it may naturally enough be imagined can never be greater than in proportion to the recompense which the price of the fleece is likely to make for the labor and expense which that attention requires it happens however that the goodness of the fleece depends in a great measure upon the health growth and bulk of the animal the same attention which is necessary for the improvement of the carcass is in some respects sufficient for that of the fleece notwithstanding the degradation of price english wool is said to have been improved considerably during the course even of the present century the improvement might perhaps have been greater if the price had been better but the lowness of price though it may have obstructed yet certainly it has not altogether prevented that improvement  the violence of these regulations therefore seems to have affected neither the quantity nor the quality of the annual produce of wool so much as it might have been expected to do though i think it probable that it may have affected the latter a good deal more than the former and the interest of the growers of wool though it must have been hurt in some degree seems upon the whole to have been much less hurt than could well have been imagined  these considerations however will not justify the absolute prohibition of the exportation of the wool but they will fully justify the imposition of a considerable tax upon that exportation  to hurt in any degree the interest of any one order of citizens for no other purpose but to promote that of some other is evidently contrary to that justice and equality of treatment which the sovereign owes to all the different orders of his subjects but the prohibition certainly hurts in some degree the interest of the growers of wool for no other purpose but to promote that of the manufacturers  every different order of citizens is bound to contribute to the support of the sovereign or commonwealth a tax of five or even of ten shillings upon the exportation of every tod of wool would produce a very considerable revenue to the sovereign it would hurt the interest of the growers somewhat less than the prohibition because it would not probably lower the price of wool quite so much it would afford a sufficient advantage to the manufacturer because though he might not buy his wool altogether so cheap as under the prohibition he would still buy it at least five or ten shillings cheaper than any foreign manufacturer could buy it besides saving the freight and insurance which the other would be obliged to pay it is scarce possible to devise a tax which could produce any considerable revenue to the sovereign and at the same time occasion so little inconveniency to any body  the prohibition notwithstanding all the penalties which guard it does not prevent the exportation of wool it is exported it is well known in great quantities the great difference between the price in the home and that in the foreign market presents such a temptation to smuggling that all the rigor of the law cannot prevent it this illegal exportation is advantageous to no body but the smuggler a legal exportation subject to a tax by affording a revenue to the sovereign and thereby saving the imposition of some other perhaps more burdensome and inconvenient taxes might prove advantageous to all the different subjects of the state  the exportation of fullers earth or fullers clay supposed to be necessary for preparing and cleansing the woollen manufactures has been subjected to nearly the same penalties as the exportation of wool even tobaccopipe clay though acknowledged to be different from fullers clay yet on account of their resemblance and because fullers clay might sometimes be exported as tobaccopipe clay has been laid under the same prohibitions and penalties  by the   th and   th of charles ii chap   the exportation not only of raw hides but of tanned leather except in the shape of boots shoes or slippers was prohibited and the law gave a monopoly to our bootmakers and shoemakers not only against our graziers but against our tanners by subsequent statutes our tanners have got themselves exempted from this monopoly upon paying a small tax of only one shilling on the hundred weight of tanned leather weighing one hundred and twelve pounds they have obtained likewise the drawback of two thirds of the excise duties imposed upon their commodity even when exported without further manufacture all manufactures of leather may be exported duty free and the exporter is besides entitled to the drawback of the whole duties of excise our graziers still continue subject to the old monopoly graziers separated from one another and dispersed through all the different corners of the country cannot without great difficulty combine together for the purpose either of imposing monopolies upon their fellowcitizens or of exempting themselves from such as may have been imposed upon them by other people manufacturers of all kinds collected together in numerous bodies in all great cities easily can even the horns of cattle are prohibited to be exported and the two insignificant trades of the horner and combmaker enjoy in this respect a monopoly against the graziers  restraints either by prohibitions or by taxes upon the exportation of goods which are partially but not completely manufactured are not peculiar to the manufacture of leather as long as any thing remains to be done in order to fit any commodity for immediate use and consumption our manufacturers think that they themselves ought to have the doing of it woollen yarn and worsted are prohibited to be exported under the same penalties as wool even white cloths are subject to a duty upon exportation and our dyers have so far obtained a monopoly against our clothiers our clothiers would probably have been able to defend themselves against it but it happens that the greater part of our principal clothiers are themselves likewise dyers watchcases clockcases and dialplates for clocks and watches have been prohibited to be exported our clockmakers and watchmakers are it seems unwilling that the price of this sort of workmanship should be raised upon them by the competition of foreigners  by some old statutes of edward iii henry viii and edward vi the exportation of all metals was prohibited lead and tin were alone excepted probably on account of the great abundance of those metals in the exportation of which a considerable part of the trade of the kingdom in those days consisted for the encouragement of the mining trade the  th of william and mary chap    exempted from this prohibition iron copper and mundic metal made from british ore the exportation of all sorts of copper bars foreign as well as british was afterward permitted by the  th and  0th of william iii chap    the exportation of unmanufactured brass of what is called gunmetal bellmetal and shroffmetal still continues to be prohibited brass manufactures of all sorts may be exported duty free  the exportation of the materials of manufacture where it is not altogether prohibited is in many cases subjected to considerable duties  by the  th george i chap    the exportation of all goods the produce or manufacture of great britain upon which any duties had been imposed by former statutes was rendered duty free the following goods however were excepted alum lead lead ore tin tanned leather copperas coals wool cards white woollen cloths lapis calaminaris skins of all sorts glue coney hair or wool hares wool hair of all sorts horses and litharge of lead if you except horses all these are either materials of manufacture or incomplete manufactures which may be considered as materials for still further manufacture or instruments of trade this statute leaves them subject to all the old duties which had ever been imposed upon them the old subsidy and one per cent outward  by the same statute a great number of foreign drugs for dyers use are exempted from all duties upon importation each of them however is afterward subjected to a certain duty not indeed a very heavy one upon exportation our dyers it seems while they thought it for their interest to encourage the importation of those drugs by an exemption from all duties thought it likewise for their interest to throw some small discouragement upon their exportation the avidity however which suggested this notable piece of mercantile ingenuity most probably disappointed itself of its object it necessarily taught the importers to be more careful than they might otherwise have been that their importation should not exceed what was necessary for the supply of the home market the home market was at all times likely to be more scantily supplied the commodities were at all times likely to be somewhat dearer there than they would have been had the exportation been rendered as free as the importation  by the abovementioned statute gum senega or gum arabic being among the enumerated dying drugs might be imported duty free they were subjected indeed to a small poundage duty amounting only to three pence in the hundred weight upon their reexportation france enjoyed at that time an exclusive trade to the country most productive of those drugs that which lies in the neighborhood of the senegal and the british market could not easily be supplied by the immediate importation of them from the place of growth by the   th geo ii therefore gum senega was allowed to be imported contrary to the general dispositions of the act of navigation from any part of europe as the law however did not mean to encourage this species of trade so contrary to the general principles of the mercantile policy of england it imposed a duty of ten shillings the hundred weight upon such importation and no part of this duty was to be afterward drawn back upon its exportation the successful war which began in      gave great britain the same exclusive trade to those countries which france had enjoyed before our manufacturers as soon as the peace was made endeavored to avail themselves of this advantage and to establish a monopoly in their own favor both against the growers and against the importers of this commodity by the  th geo iii therefore chap    the exportation of gum senega from his majestys dominions in africa was confined to great britain and was subjected to all the same restrictions regulations forfeitures and penalties as that of the enumerated commodities of the british colonies in america and the west indies its importation indeed was subjected to a small duty of sixpence the hundred weight but its reexportation was subjected to the enormous duty of one pound ten shillings the hundred weight it was the intention of our manufacturers that the whole produce of those countries should be imported into great britain and in order that they themselves might be enabled to buy it at their own price that no part of it should be exported again but at such an expense as would sufficiently discourage that exportation their avidity however upon this as well as upon many other occasions disappointed itself of its object this enormous duty presented such a temptation to smuggling that great quantities of this commodity were clandestinely exported probably to all the manufacturing countries of europe but particularly to holland not only from great britain but from africa upon this account by the    geo iii chap  0 this duty upon exportation was reduced to five shillings the hundred weight  in the book of rates according to which the old subsidy was levied beaver skins were estimated at six shillings and eight pence a piece and the different subsidies and imposts which before the year      had been laid upon their importation amounted to onefifth part of the rate or to sixteen pence upon each skin all of which except half the old subsidy amounting only to two pence was drawn back upon exportation this duty upon the importation of so important a material of manufacture had been thought too high and in the year      the rate was reduced to two shillings and sixpence which reduced the duty upon importation to sixpence and of this only one half was to be drawn back upon exportation the same successful war put the country most productive of beaver under the dominion of great britain and beaver skins being among the enumerated commodities their exportation from america was consequently confined to the market of great britain our manufacturers soon bethought themselves of the advantage which they might make of this circumstance and in the year      the duty upon the importation of beaverskin was reduced to one penny but the duty upon exportation was raised to seven pence each skin without any drawback of the duty upon importation by the same law a duty of eighteen pence the pound was imposed upon the exportation of beaverwool or wombs without making any alteration in the duty upon the importation of that commodity which when imported by british and in british shipping amounted at that time to between four pence and five pence the piece  coals may be considered both as a material of manufacture and as an instrument of trade heavy duties accordingly have been imposed upon their exportation amounting at present      to more than five shillings the ton or to more than fifteen shillings the chaldron newcastle measure which is in most cases more than the original value of the commodity at the coal pit or even at the shipping port for exportation  the exportation however of the instruments of trade properly so called is commonly restrained not by high duties but by absolute prohibitions thus by the  th and  th of william iii chap  0 sect   the exportation of frames or engines for knitting gloves or stockings is prohibited under the penalty not

administrator to any person or of taking any lands within this kingdom by descent devise or purchase he likewise forfeits to the king all his lands goods and chattels is declared an alien in every respect and is put out of the kings protection  it is unnecessary i imagine to observe how contrary such regulations are to the boasted liberty of the subject of which we affect to be so very jealous but which in this case is so plainly sacrificed to the futile interests of our merchants and manufacturers  the laudable motive of all these regulations is to extend our own manufactures not by their own improvement but by the depression of those of all our neighbors and by putting an end as much as possible to the troublesome competition of such odious and disagreeable rivals our master manufacturers think it reasonable that they themselves should have the monopoly of the ingenuity of all their countrymen though by restraining in some trades the number of apprentices which can be employed at one time and by imposing the necessity of a long apprenticeship in all trades they endeavor all of them to confine the knowledge of their respective employments to as small a number as possible they are unwilling however that any part of this small number should go abroad to instruct foreigners  consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer the maxim is so perfectly selfevident that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it but in the mercantile system the interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer and it seems to consider production and not consumption as the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce  in the restraints upon the importation of all foreign commodities which can come into competition with those of our own growth or manufacture the interest of the homeconsumer is evidently sacrificed to that of the producer it is altogether for the benefit of the latter that the former is obliged to pay that enhancement of price which this monopoly almost always occasions  it is altogether for the benefit of the producer that bounties are granted upon the exportation of some of his productions the homeconsumer is obliged to pay first the tax which is necessary for paying the bounty and secondly the still greater tax which necessarily arises from the enhancement of the price of the commodity in the home market  by the famous treaty of commerce with portugal the consumer is prevented by high duties from purchasing of a neighboring country a commodity which our own climate does not produce but is obliged to purchase it of a distant country though it is acknowledged that the commodity of the distant country is of a worse quality than that of the near one the homeconsumer is obliged to submit to this inconveniency in order that the producer may import into the distant country some of his productions upon more advantageous terms than he would otherwise have been allowed to do the consumer too is obliged to pay whatever enhancement in the price of those very productions this forced exportation may occasion in the homemarket  but in the system of laws which has been established for the management of our american and west indian colonies the interest of the homeconsumer has been sacrificed to that of the producer with a more extravagant profusion than in all our other commercial regulations a great empire has been established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers who should be obliged to buy from the shops of our different producers all the goods with which these could supply them for the sake of that little enhancement of price which this monopoly might afford our producers the homeconsumers have been burdened with the whole expense of maintaining and defending that empire for this purpose and for this purpose only in the two last wars more than two hundred millions have been spent and a new debt of more than a hundred and seventy millions has been contracted over and above all that had been expended for the same purpose in former wars the interest of this debt alone is not only greater than the whole extraordinary profit which it ever could be pretended was made by the monopoly of the colony trade but than the whole value of that trade or than the whole value of the goods which at an average have been annually exported to the colonies  it cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of this whole mercantile system not the consumers we may believe whose interest has been entirely neglected but the producers whose interest has been so carefully attended to and among this latter class our merchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects in the mercantile regulations which have been taken notice of in this chapter the interest of our manufacturers has been most peculiarly attended to and the interest not so much of the consumers as that of some other sets of producers has been sacrificed to it  vol ii page     line    after the words to fall under their displeasure insert what follows of the public works and institutions which are necessary for facilitating particular branches of commerce  the object of the public works and institutions above mentioned is to facilitate commerce in general but in order to facilitate some particular branches of it particular institutions are necessary which again require a particular and extraordinary expense  some particular branches of commerce which are carried on with barbarous and uncivilized nations require extraordinary protection an ordinary store or counting house could give little security to the goods of the merchants who trade to the western coast of africa to defend them from the barbarous natives it is necessary that the place where they are deposited should be in some measure fortified the disorders in the government of indostan have been supposed to render a like precaution necessary even among that mild and gentle people and it was under pretense of securing their persons and property from violence that both the english and french east india companies were allowed to erect the first forts which they possessed in that country among other nations whose vigorous government will suffer no strangers to possess any fortified place within their territory it may be necessary to maintain some ambassador minister or consul who may both decide according to their own customs the differences arising among his own countrymen and in their disputes with the natives may by means of his public character interfere with more authority and afford them a more powerful protection than they could expect from any private man the interests of commerce have frequently made it necessary to maintain ministers in foreign countries where the purposes either of war or alliance would not have required any the commerce of the turkey company first occasioned the establishment of an ordinary ambassador at constantinople the first english embassies to russia arose altogether from commercial interests the constant interference which those interests necessarily occasioned between the subjects of the different states of europe has probably introduced the custom of keeping in all neighboring countries ambassadors or ministers constantly resident even in the time of peace this custom unknown to ancient times seems not to be older than the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth century that is than the time when commerce first began to extend itself to the greater part of the nations of europe and when they first began to attend to its interests  it seems not unreasonable that the extraordinary expense which the protection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion should be defrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch by a moderate fine for example to be paid by the traders when they first enter into it or what is more equal by a particular duty of so much per cent upon the goods which they either import into or export out of the particular countries with which it is carried on the protection of trade in general from pirates and freebooters is said to have given occasion to the first institution of the duties of customs but if it was thought reasonable to lay a general tax upon trade in order to defray the expense of protecting trade in general it should seem equally reasonable to lay a particular tax upon a particular branch of trade in order to defray the extraordinary expense of protecting that branch  the protection of trade in general has always been considered as essential to the defense of the commonwealth and upon that account a necessary part of the duty of the executive power the collection and application of the general duties of customs therefore have always been left to that power but the protection of any particular branch of trade is a part of the general protection of trade a part therefore of the duty of that power and if nations always acted consistently the particular duties levied for the purposes of such particular protection should always have been left equally to its disposal but in this respect as well as in many others nations have not always acted consistently and in the greater part of the commercial states of europe particular companies of merchants have had the address to persuade the legislature to entrust to them the performance of this part of the duty of the sovereign together with all the powers which are necessarily connected with it  these companies though they may perhaps have been useful for the first introduction of some branches of commerce by making at their own expense an experiment which the state might not think it prudent to make have in the longrun proved universally either burdensome or useless and have either mismanaged or confined the trade  when those companies do not trade upon a joint stock but are obliged to admit any person properly qualified upon paying a certain fine and agreeing to submit to the regulations of the company each member trading upon his own stock and at his own risk they are called regulated companies when they trade upon a joint stock each member sharing in the common profit or loss in proportion to his share in this stock they are called joint stock companies such companies whether regulated or joint stock sometimes have and sometimes have not exclusive privileges  regulated companies resemble in every respect the corporations of trades so common in the cities and towns of all the different countries of europe and are a sort of enlarged monopolies of the same kind as no inhabitant of a town can exercise an incorporated trade without first obtaining his freedom in the corporation so in most cases no subject of the state can lawfully carry on any branch of foreign trade for which a regulated company is established without first becoming a member of that company the monopoly is more or less strict according as the terms of admission are more or less difficult and according as the directors of the company have more or less authority or have it more or less in their power to manage in such a manner as to confine the greater part of the trade to themselves and their particular friends in the most ancient regulated companies the privileges of apprenticeship were the same as in other corporations and entitled the person who had served his time to a member of the company to become himself a member either without paying any fine or upon paying a much smaller one than what was exacted of other people the usual corporation spirit wherever the law does not restrain it prevails in all regulated companies when they have been allowed to act according to their natural genius they have always in order to confine the competition to as small a number of persons as possible endeavored to subject the trade to many burdensome regulations when the law has restrained them from doing this they have become altogether useless and insignificant  the regulated companies for foreign commerce which at present subsist in great britain are the ancient merchant adventurers company now commonly called the hamburgh company the russian company the eastland company the turkey company and the african company  the terms of admission into the hamburgh company are now said to be quite easy and the directors either have it not in their power to subject the trade to any burdensome restraints or regulations or at least have not of late exercised that power it has not always been so about the middle of the last century the fine for admission was fifty and at one time one hundred pounds and the conduct of the company was said to be extremely oppressive in      in      and in      the clothiers and free traders of the west of england complained of them to parliament as of monopolists who confined the trade and oppressed the manufactures of the country though those complaints produced no act of parliament they had probably intimidated the company so far as to oblige them to reform their conduct since that time at least there has been no complaints against them by the  0th and   th of william iii c   the fine for admission into the russian company was reduced to five pounds and by the   th of charles ii c   that for admission into the eastland company to forty shillings while at the same time sweden denmark and norway all the countries on the northside of the baltic were exempted from their exclusive charter the conduct of those companies had probably given occasion to those two acts of parliament before that time sir josiah child had represented both these and the hamburgh company as extremely oppressive and imputed to their bad management the low state of the trade which we at that time carried on to the countries comprehended within their respective charters but though such companies may not in the present times be very oppressive they are certainly altogether useless to be merely useless indeed is perhaps the highest eulogy which can ever justly be bestowed upon a regulated company and all the three companies above mentioned seem in their present state to deserve this eulogy  the fine for admission into the turkey company was formerly twentyfive pounds for all persons under twentysix years of age and fifty pounds for all persons above that age nobody but mere merchants could be admitted a restriction which excluded all shopkeepers and retailers by a byelaw no british manufactures could be exported to turkey but in the general ships of the company and as those ships sailed always from the port of london this restriction confined the trade to that extensive port and the traders to those who lived in london and in its neighborhood by another byelaw no person living within twenty miles of london and not free of the city could be admitted a member another restriction which joined to the foregoing necessarily excluded all but the freemen of london as the time for the loading and sailing of those general ships depended altogether upon the directors they could easily fill them with their own goods and those of their particular friends to the exclusion of others who they might pretend had made their proposals too late in this state of things therefore this company was in every respect a strict and oppressive monopoly those abuses gave occasion to the act of the   th of geo ii c    reducing the fine for admission to twenty pounds for all persons without any distinction of ages or any restriction either to mere merchants or to the freemen of london and granting to all such persons the liberty of exporting from all the ports of great britain to any port in turkey all british goods of which the exportation was not prohibited and of importing from thence all turkish goods of which the importation was not prohibited upon paying both the general duties of customs and the particular duties assessed for defraying the necessary expenses of the company and submitting at the same time to the lawful authority of the british ambassador and consuls resident in turkey and to the byelaws of the company duly enacted to prevent any oppression by those byelaws it was by the same act ordained that if any seven members of the company conceived themselves aggrieved by any byelaw which should be enacted after the passing of this act they might appeal to the board of trade and plantations to the authority of which a committee of the privy council has now succeeded provided such appeal was brought within twelve months after the byelaw was enacted and that if any seven members conceived themselves aggrieved by any byelaw which had been enacted before the passing of this act they might bring a like appeal provided it was within twelve months after the day on which this act was to take place the experience of one year however may not always be sufficient to discover to all the members of a great company the pernicious tendency of a particular byelaw and if several of them should afterward discover it neither the board of trade nor the committee of council can afford them any redress the object besides of the greater part of the byelaws of all regulated companies as well as of all other corporations is not so much to oppress those who are already members as to discourage others from becoming so which may be done not only by a high fine but by many other contrivances the constant view of such companies is always to raise the rate of their own profit as high as they can to keep the market both for the goods which they export and for those which they import as much understocked as they can which can be done only by restraining the competition or by discouraging new adventurers from entering into the trade a fine even of twenty pounds besides though it may not perhaps be sufficient to discourage any man from entering into the turkey trade with an intention to continue in it may be enough to discourage a speculative merchant from hazarding a single adventure in it in all trades the regular established traders even though not incorporated naturally combine to raise profits which are noway so likely to be kept at all times down to their proper level as by the occasional competition of speculative adventurers the turkey trade though in some measure laid open by this act of parliament is still considered by many people as very far from being altogether free the turkey company contribute to maintain an ambassador and two or three consuls who like other public ministers ought to be maintained altogether by the state and the trade laid open to all his majestys subjects the different taxes levied by the company for this and other corporation purposes might afford a revenue much more than sufficient to enable the state to maintain such ministers  regulated companies it was observed by sir josiah child though they had frequently supported public ministers had never maintained any forts or garrisons in the countries to which they traded whereas joint stock companies frequently had and in reality the former seem to be much more unfit for this sort of service than the latter first the directors of a regulated company have no particular interest in the prosperity of the general trade of the company for the sake of which such forts and garrisons are maintained the decay of that general trade may even frequently contribute to the advantage of their own private trade as by diminishing the number of their competitors it may enable them both to buy cheaper and to sell dearer the directors of a joint stock company on the contrary having only their share in the profits which are made upon the common stock committed to their management have no private trade of their own of which the interest can be separated from that of the general trade of the company their private interest is connected with the prosperity of the general trade of the company and with the maintenance of the forts and garrisons which are necessary for its defense they are more likely therefore to have that continual and careful attention which that maintenance necessarily requires secondly the directors of a joint stock company have always the management of a large capital the joint stock of the company a part of which they may frequently employ with propriety in building repairing and maintaining such necessary forts and garrisons but the directors of a regulated company having the management of no common capital have no other fund to employ in this way but the casual revenue arising from the admission fines and from the corporation duties imposed upon the trade of the company though they had the same interest therefore to attend to the maintenance of such forts and garrisons they can seldom have the same ability to render that attention effectual the maintenance of a public minister requiring scarce any attention and but a moderate and limited expense is a business much more suitable both to the temper and abilities of a regulated company  long after the time of sir josiah child however in    0 a regulated company was established the present company of merchants trading to africa which was expressly charged at first with the maintenance of all the british forts and garrisons that lie between cape blanc and the cape of good hope and afterward with that of those only which lie between cape rouge and the cape of good hope the act which establishes this company the   d of george ii c    seems to have had two distinct objects in view first to restrain effectually the oppressive and monopolizing spirit which is natural to the directors of a regulated company and secondly to force them as much as possible to give an attention which is not natural to them toward the maintenance of forts and garrisons  for the first of these purposes the fine for admission is limited to forty shillings the company is prohibited from trading in their corporate capacity or upon a joint stock from borrowing money upon common seal or from laying any restraints upon the trade which may be carried on freely from all places and by all persons being british subjects and paying the fine the government is in a committee of nine persons who meet at london but who are chosen annually by the freemen of the company at london bristol and liverpool three from each place no committeeman can be continued in office for more than three years together any committeeman might be removed by the board of trade and plantations now by a committee of council after being heard in his own defense the committee are forbid to export negroes from africa or to import any african goods into great britain but as they are charged with the maintenance of forts and garrisons they may for that purpose export from great britain to africa goods and stores of different kinds out of the moneys which they shall receive from the company they are allowed a sum not exceeding eight hundred pounds for the salaries of their clerks and agents at london bristol and liverpool the houserent of their office at london and all the other expenses of management commission and agency in england what remains of this sum after defraying these different expenses they may divide among themselves as compensation for their trouble in what manner they think proper by this constitution it might have been expected that the spirit of monopoly would have been effectually restrained and the first of these purposes sufficiently answered it would seem however that it had not though by the  th of george iii c  0 the fort of senegal with all its dependencies had been vested in the company of merchants trading to africa yet in the year following by the  th of geo iii c    not only senegal and its dependencies but the whole coast from the port of sallee in south barbary to cape rouge was exempted from the jurisdiction of that company was vested in the crown and the trade to it declared free to all his majestys subjects the company had been suspected of restraining the trade and of establishing some sort of improper monopoly it is not however very easy to conceive how under the regulations of the   d geo ii they could do so in the printed debates of the house of commons not always the most authentic records of truth i observe however that they have been accused of this the members of the committee of nine being all merchants and the governors and factors in their different forts and settlements being all dependent upon them it is not unlikely that the latter might have given peculiar attention to the consignments and commissions of the former which would establish a real monopoly  for the second of these purposes the maintenance of the forts and garrisons an annual sum has been allotted to them by parliament generally about   000 l for the proper application of this sum the committee is obliged to account annually to the cursitor baron of exchequer which account is afterward to be laid before parliament but parliament which gives so little attention to the application of millions is not likely to give much to that of   000 l a year and the cursitor baron of exchequer from his profession and education is not likely to be profoundly skilled in the proper expense of forts and garrisons the captains of his majestys navy indeed or any other commissioned officers appointed by the board of admiralty may enquire into the condition of the forts and garrisons and report their observations to that board but that board seems to have no direct jurisdiction over the committee nor any authority to correct those whose conduct it may thus enquire into and the captains of his majestys navy besides are not supposed to be always deeply learned in the science of fortification removal from an office which can be enjoyed only for the term of three years and of which the lawful emoluments even during that term are so very small seems to be the utmost punishment to which any committeeman is liable for any fault except direct malversation or embezzlement either of the public money or of that of the company and the fear of that punishment can never be a motive of sufficient weight to force a continual and careful attention to a business to which he has no other interest to attend the committee are accused of having sent out bricks and stones from england for the reparation of cape coast castle on the coast of guinea a business for which parliament had several times granted an extraordinary sum of money these bricks and stones too which had thus been sent upon so long a voyage were said to have been of so bad a quality that it was necessary to rebuild from the foundation the walls which had been repaired with them the forts and garrisons which lie north of cape rouge are not only maintained at the expense of the state but are under the immediate government of the executive power and why those which lie south of that cape and which too are in part at least maintained at the expense of the state should be under a different government it seems not very easy even to imagine a good reason the protection of the mediterranean trade was the original purpose or pretense of the garrisons of gibraltar and minorca and the maintenance and government of those garrisons has always been very properly committed not to the turkey company but to the executive power in the extent of its dominion consists in a great measure the pride and dignity of that power and it is not very likely to fail in attention to what is necessary for the defense of that dominion the garrisons at gibraltar and minorca accordingly have never been neglected though minorca has been twice taken and is now probably lost for ever that disaster was never even imputed to any neglect in the executive power i would not however be understood to insinuate that either of those expensive garrisons was ever even in the smallest degree necessary for the purpose for which they were originally dismembered from the spanish monarchy that dismemberment perhaps never served any other real purpose than to alienate from england her natural ally the king of spain and to unite the two principal branches of the house of bourbon in a much stricter and more parmanent alliance than the ties of blood could ever have united them  joint stock companies established either by royal charter or by act of parliament differ in several respects not only from regulated companies but from private copartneries  first in a private copartnery no partner without the consent of the company can transfer his share to another person or introduce a new member into the company each member however may upon proper warning withdraw from the copartnery and demand payment from them of his share of the common stock in a joint stock company on the contrary no member can demand payment of his share from the company but each member can without their consent transfer his share to another person and thereby introduce a new member the value of a share in a joint stock is always the price which it will bring in the market and this may be either greater or less in any proportion than the sum which its owner stands credited for in the stock of the company  secondly in a private copartnery each partner is bound for the debts contracted by the company to the whole extent of his fortune in a joint stock company on the contrary each partner is bound only to the extent of his share  the trade of a joint stock company is always managed by a court of directors this court indeed is frequently subject in many respects to the control of a general court of proprietors but the greater part of those proprietors seldom pretend to understand any thing of the business of the company and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail among them give themselves no trouble about it but receive contentedly such half yearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make to them this total exemption from trouble and from risk beyond a limited sum encourages many people to become adventurers in joint stock companies who would upon no account hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery such companies therefore commonly draw to themselves much greater stocks than any private copartnery can boast of the trading stock of the south sea company at one time amounted to upwards of thirtythree millions eight hundred thousand pounds the divided capital of the bank of england amounts at present to ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds the directors of such companies however being the managers rather of other peoples money than of their own it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own like the stewards of a rich man they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their masters honor and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it negligence and profusion therefore must always prevail more or less in the management of the affairs of such a company it is upon this account that joint stock companies for foreign trade have seldom been able to maintain the competition against private adventurers they have accordingly very seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege and frequently have not succeeded with one without an exclusive privilege they have commonly mismanaged the trade with an exclusive privilege they have both mismanaged and confined it  the royal african company the predecessors of the present african company had an exclusive privilege by charter but as that charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament the trade in consequence of the declaration of rights was soon after the revolution laid open to all his majestys subjects the hudsons bay company are as to their legal rights in the same situation as the royal african company their exclusive charter has not been confirmed by act of parliament the south sea company as long as they continued to be a trading company had an exclusive privilege confirmed by act of parliament as have likewise the present united company of merchants trading to the east indies  the royal african company soon found that they could not maintain the competition against private adventurers whom notwithstanding the declaration of rights they continued for some time to call interlopers and to persecute as such in school however the private adventurers were subjected to a duty of ten per cent upon almost all the different branches of their trade to be employed by the company in the maintenance of their forts and garrisons but notwithstanding this heavy tax the company were still unable to maintain the competition their stock and credit gradually declined in      their debts had become so great that a particular act of parliament was thought necessary both for their security and for that of their creditors it was enacted that the resolution of twothirds of these creditors in number and value should bind the rest both with regard to the time which should be allowed to the company for the payment of their debts and with regard to any other agreement which it might be thought proper to make with them concerning those debts in    0 their affairs were in so great disorder that they were altogether incapable of maintaining their forts and garrisons the sole purpose and pretext of their institution from that year till their final dissolution the parliament judged it necessary to allow the annual sum of ten thousand pounds for that purpose in      after having been for many years losers by the trade of carrying negroes to the west indies they at last resolved to give it up altogether to sell to the private traders to america the negroes which they purchased upon the coast and to employ their servants in a trade to the inland parts of africa for gold dust elephants teeth dying drugs etc but their success in this more confined trade was not greater than in their former extensive one their affairs continued to go gradually to decline till at last being in every respect a bankrupt company they were dissolved by act of parliament and their forts and garrisons vested in the present regulated company of merchants trading to africa before the erection of the royal african company there had been three other joint stock companies successively established one after another for the african trade they were all equally unsuccessful they all however had exclusive charters which though not confirmed by act of parliament were in those days supposed to convey a real exclusive privilege  the hudsons bay company before their misfortunes in the late war had been much more fortunate than the royal african company their necessary expense is much smaller the whole number of people whom they maintain in their different settlements and habitations which they have honored with the name of forts is said not to exceed a hundred and twenty persons this number however is sufficient to prepare beforehand the cargo of furs and other goods necessary for loading their ships which on account of the ice can seldom remain above six or eight weeks in those seas this advantage of having a cargo ready prepared could not for several years be acquired by private adventurers and without it there seems to be no possibility of trading to hudsons bay the moderate capital of the company which it is said does not exceed one hundred and ten thousand pounds may besides be sufficient to enable them to engross the whole or almost the whole trade and surplus produce of the miserable though extensive country comprehended within their charter no private adventurers accordingly have ever attempted to trade to that country in competition with them this company therefore have always enjoyed an exclusive trade in fact though they may have no right to it in law over and above all this the moderate capital of this company is said to be divided among a very small number of proprietors but a joint stock company consisting of a small number of proprietors with a moderate capital approaches very nearly to the nature of a private copartnery and may be capable of nearly the same degree of vigilance and attention it is not to be wondered at therefore if in consequence of these different advantages the hudsons bay company had before the late war been able to carry on their trade with a considerable degree of success it does not seem probable however that their profits ever approached to what the late mr dobbs imagined them a much more sober and judicious writer mr anderson author of the historical and chronological deduction of commerce very justly observes that upon examining the accounts which mr dobbs himself has given for several years together of their exports and imports and upon making proper allowances for their extraordinary risk and expense it does not appear that their profits deserve to be envied or that they can much if at all exceed the ordinary profits of trade  the south sea company never had any forts or garrisons to maintain and therefore were entirely exempted from one great expense to which other joint stock companies for foreign trade are subject but they had an immense capital divided among an immense number of proprietors it was naturally to be expected therefore that folly negligence and profusion should prevail in the whole management of their affairs the knavery and extravagance of their stockjobbing projects are sufficiently known and the explication of them would be foreign to the present subject their mercantile projects were not much better conducted the first trade which they engaged in was that of supplying the spanish west indies with negroes of which in consequence of what was called the assiento contract granted them by the treaty of utrecht they had the exclusive privilege but as it was not expected that much profit could be made by this trade both the portugueze and french companies who had enjoyed it upon the same terms before them having been ruined by it they were allowed as compensation to send annually a ship of a certain burden to trade directly to the spanish west indies of the ten voyages which this annual ship was allowed to make they are said to have gained considerably by one that of the royal caroline in      and to have been losers more or less by almost all the rest their ill success was imputed by their factors and agents to the extortion and oppression of the spanish government but was perhaps principally owing to the profusion and depredations of those very factors and agents some of whom are said to have acquired great fortunes even in one year in      the company petitioned the king that they might be allowed to dispose of the trade and tunnage of their annual ship on account of the little profit which they made by it and to accept of such equivalent as they could obtain from the king of spain  in      this company had undertaken the whalefishery of this indeed they had no monopoly but as long as they carried it on no other british subjects appear to have engaged in it of the eight voyages which their ships made to greenland they were gainers by one and losers by all the rest after their eighth and last voyage when they had sold their ships stores and utensils they found that their whole loss upon this branch capital and interest included amounted to upwards of two hundred and thirtyseven thousand pounds  in      this company petitioned the parliament to be allowed to divide their immense capital of more than thirtythree millions eight hundred thousand pounds the whole of which had been lent to government into two equal parts the one half or upwards of sixteen millions nine hundred thousand pounds to be put upon the same sooting with other government annuities and not to be subject to the debts contracted or losses incurred by the directors of the company in the prosecution of their mercantile projects the other half to remain as before a trading stock and to be subject to those debts and losses the petition was too reasonable not to be granted in      they again petitioned the parliament that threefourths of their trading stock might be turned into annuity stock and only onefourth remain as trading stock or exposed to the hazards arising from the bad management of their directors both their annuity and trading stocks had by this time been reduced more than two millions each by several different payments from government so that this fourth amounted only to         l   s   d in      all the demands of the company upon the king of spain in consequence of the assiento contract were by the treaty of aixlachapelle given up for what was supposed an equivalent an end was put to their trade with the spanish west indies the remainder of their trading stock was turned into an annuity stock and the company ceased in every respect to be a trading company  it ought to be observed that in the trade which the south sea company carried on by means of their annual ship the only trade by which it ever was expected that they could make any considerable profit they were not without competitors either in the foreign or in the home market at carthagena porto bello and la vera cruz they had to encounter the competition of the spanish merchants who brought from cadiz to those markets european goods of the same kind with the outward cargo of their ship and in england they had to encounter that of the english merchants who imported from cadiz goods of the spanish west indies of the same kind with the inward cargo the goods both of the spanish and english merchants indeed were perhaps subject to higher duties but the loss occasioned by the negligence profusion and malversation of the servants of the company had probably been a tax much heavier than all those duties that a joint stock company should be able to carry on successfully any branch of foreign trade when private adventurers can come into any sort of open and fair competition with them seems contrary to all experience  the old english east india company was established in   00 by a charter from queen elizabeth in the first twelve voyages which they sitted out for india they appear to have traded as a regulated company with separate stocks though only in the general ships of the company in      they united into a joint stock their charter was exclusive and though not confirmed by act of parliament was in those days supposed to convey a real exclusive privilege for many years therefore they were not much disturbed by interlopers their capital which never exceeded seven hundred and fortyfour thousand pounds and of which fifty pounds was a share was not so exorbitant nor their dealings so extensive as to afford either a pretext for gross negligence and profusion or a cover to gross malversation notwithstanding some extraordinary losses occasioned partly by the malice of the dutch east india company and partly by other accidents they carried on for many years a successful trade but in process of time when the principles of liberty were better understood it became every day more and more doubtful how far a royal charter not confirmed by act of parliament could convey an exclusive privilege upon this question the decisions of the courts of justice were not uniform but varied with the authority of government and the humors of the times interlopers multiplied upon them and toward the end of the reign of charles ii through the whole of that of james ii and during a part of that of william iii reduced them to great distress in school a proposal was made to parliament of advancing two millions to government at eight per cent provided the subscribers were erected into a new east india company with exclusive privileges the old east india company offered seven hundred thousand pounds nearly the amount of their capital at four per cent upon the same conditions but such was at that time the state of public credit that it was more convenient for government to borrow two millions at eight per cent than seven hundred thousand pounds at four the proposal of the new subscribers was accepted and a new east india company established in consequence the old east india company however had a right to continue their trade till   0  they had at the same time in the name of their treasurer subscribed very artfully three hundred and fifteen thousand pounds into the stock of the new by a negligence in the expression of the act of parliament which vested the east india trade in the subscribers to this loan of two millions it did not appear evident that they were all obliged to unite into a joint stock a few private traders whose subscriptions amounted only to seven thousand two hundred pounds insisted upon the privilege of trading separately upon their own stocks and at their own risk the old east india company had a right to a separate trade upon their old stock till   0  and they had likewise both before and after that period a right like that of other private traders to a separate trade upon the three hundred and fifteen thousand pounds which they had subscribed into the stock of the new company the competition of the two companies with the private traders and with one another is said to have well nigh ruined both upon a subsequent occasion in    0 when a proposal was made to parliament for putting the trade under the management of a regulated company and thereby laying it in some measure open the east india company in opposition to this proposal represented in very strong terms what had been at this time the miserable effects as they thought them of this competition in india they said it raised the price of goods so high that they were not worth the buying and in england by overstocking the market it sunk their price so low that no profit could be made by them that by a more plentiful supply to the great advantage and convenience of the public it must have reduced very much the price of india goods in the english market cannont well be doubted but that it should have raised very much their price in the indian market seems not very probable as all the extraordinary demand which that competition could occasion must have been but as a drop of water in the immense ocean of indian commerce the increase of demand besides though in the beginning it may sometimes raise the price of goods never fails to lower it in the longrun it encourages production and thereby increases the competition of the producers who in order to undersell one another have recourse to new divisions of labor and new improvements of art which might never otherwise have been thought of the miserable effects of which the company complained were the cheapness of consumption and the encouragement given to production precisely the two effects which it is the great business of political economy to promote the competition however of which they gave this doleful account had not been allowed to be of long continuance in   0  the two companies were in some measure united by an indenture tripartite to which the queen was the third party and in   0  they were by act of parliament perfectly consolidated into one company by their present name of the united company of merchants trading to the east indies into this act it was thought worth while to insert a clause allowing the separate traders to continue their trade till michaelmas      but at the same time empowering the directors upon three years notice to redeem their little capital of seven thousand two hundred pounds and thereby to convert the whole stock of the company into a joint stock by the same act the capital of the company in consequence of a new loan to government was augmented from two millions to three millions two hundred thousand pounds in      the company advanced another million to government but this million being raised not by a call upon the proprietors but by selling annuities and contracting bonddebts it did not augment the stock upon which the proprietors could claim a dividend it augmented however their trading stock it being equally liable with the other three millions two hundred thousand pounds to the losses sustained and debts contracted by the company in prosecution of their mercantile projects from   0  or at least from      this company being delivered from all competitors and fully established in the monopoly of the english commerce to the east indies carried on a successful trade and from their profits made annually a moderate dividend to their proprietors during the french war which began in      the ambition of mr dupleix the french governor of pondicherry involved them in the wars of the carnatic and in the politics of the indian princes after many signal successes and equally signal losses they at last lost madras at that time their principal settlement in india it was restored to them by the treaty of aixlachapelle and about this time the spirit of war and conquest seems to have taken possession of their servants in india and never since to have left them during the french war which began in      their arms partook of the general good fortune of those of great britain they defended madras took pondicherry recovered calcutta and acquired the revenues of a rich and extensive territory amounting it was then said to upwards of three millions a year they remained for several years in quiet possession of this revenue but in      administration laid claim to their territorial acquisitions and the revenue arising from them as of right belonging to the crown and the company in compensation for this claim agreed to pay to government four hundred thousand pounds a year they had before this gradually augmented their dividend from about six to ten per cent that is upon their capital of three millions two hundred thousand pounds they had increased it by a hundred and twentyeight thousand pounds or had raised it from one hundred and ninetytwo thousand to three hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year they were attempting about this time to raise it still further to twelve and a half per cent which would have made their annual payments to their proprietors equal to what they had agreed to pay annually to government or to four hundred thousand pounds a year but during the two years in which their agreement with government was to take place they were restrained from any further increase of dividend by two successive acts of parliament of which the object was to enable them to make a speedier progress in the payment of their debts which were at this time estimated at upwards of six or seven millions sterling in      they renewed their agreement with government for five years more and stipulated that during the course of that period they should be allowed gradually to increase their dividend to twelve and a half per cent never increasing it however more than one per cent in one year this increase of dividend therefore when it had risen to its utmost height could augment their annual payments to their proprietors and government together but by six hundred and eight thousand pounds beyond what they had been before their late territorial acquisitions what the gross revenue of those territorial acquisitions was supposed to amount to has already been mentioned and by an account brought by the cruttenden east indiaman in      the nett revenue clear of all deductions and military charges was stated at two millions fortyeight thousand seven hundred and fortyseven pounds they were said at the same time to possess another revenue arising partly from lands but chiefly from the customs established at their different settlements amounting to four hundred and thirtynine thousand pounds the profits of their trade too according to the evidence of their chairman before the house of commons amounted at this time to at least four hundred thousand pounds a year according to that of their accomptant to at least five hundred thousand according to the lowest account at least equal to the highest dividend that was to be paid to their proprietors so great a revenue might certainly have afforded an augmentation of six hundred and eight thousand pounds in their annual payments and at the same time have left a large sinking fund sufficient for the speedy reduction of their debts in      however their debts instead of being reduced were augmented by an arrear to the treasury in the payment of the four hundred thousand pounds by another to the customhouse for duties unpaid by a large debt to the bank for money borrowed and by a fourth for bills drawn upon them from india and wantonly accepted to the amount of upwards of twelve hundred thousand pounds the distress which these accumulated claims brought upon them obliged them not only to reduce all at once their dividend to six per cent but to throw themselves upon the mercy of government and to supplicate first a release from the further payment of the stipulated four hundred thousand pounds a year and secondly a loan of fourteen hundred thousand to save them from immediate bankruptey the great increase of their fortune had it seems only served to furnish their servants with a pretext for greater profusion and a cover for greater malversation than in proportion even to that increase of fortune the conduct of their servants in india and the general state of their affairs both in india and in europe became the subjects of a parliamentary inquiry in consequence of which several very important alterations were made in the constitution of their government both at home and abroad in india their principal settlements of madras bombay and calcutta which had before been altogether independent of one another were subjected to a governorgeneral assisted by a council of four assessors parliament assuming to itself the first nomination of this governor and council who were to reside at calcutta that city having now become what madras was before the most important of the english settlements in india the court of the mayor of calcutta originally instituted for the trial of mercantile causes which arose in the city and neighborhood had gradually extended its jurisdiction with the extension of the empire it was now reduced and consined to the original purpose of its institution instead of it a new supreme court of judicature was established consisting of a chief justice and three judges to be appointed by the crown in europe the qualification necessary to entitle a proprietor to vote at their general courts was raised from five hundred pounds the original price of a share in the stock of the company to a thousand pounds in order to vote upon this qualification too it was declared necessary that he should have possessed it if acquired by his own purchase and not by inheritance for at least one year instead of six months the term requisite before the court of twentyfour directors had before been chosen annually but it was now enacted that each director should for the future be chosen for four years six of them however to go out of office by rotation every year and not to be capable of being rechosen at the election of the six new directors for the ensuing year in consequence of these alterations the courts both of the proprietors and directors it was expected would be likely to act with more dignity and steadiness than they had usually done before but it seems impossible by any alterations to render those courts in any respect fit to govern or even to share in the government of a great empire because the greater part of their members must always have too little interest in the prosperity of that empire to give any serious attention to what may promote it frequently a man of great sometimes even a man of small fortune is willing to purchase a thousand pounds share in india stock merely for the influence which he expects to acquire by a vote in the court of proprietors it gives him a share though not in the plunder yet in the appointment of the plunderers of india the court of directors though they make that appointment being necessarily more or less under the influence of the proprietors who not only elect those directors but sometimes overruled the appointments of their servants in india provided he can enjoy this influence for a few years and thereby provide for a certain number of his friends he frequently cares little about the dividend or even about the value of the stock upon which his vote is founded about the prosperity of the great empire in the government of which that vote gives him a share he seldom cares at all no other sovereigns ever were or from the nature of things ever could be so perfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects the improvement or waste of their dominions the glory or disgrace of their administration as from irresistible moral causes the greater part of the proprietors of such a mercantile company are and necessarily must be this indifference too was more likely to be increased than diminished by some of the new regulations which were made in consequence of the parliamentary inquiry by a resolution of the house of commons for example it was declared that when the fourteen hundred thousand pounds lent to the company by government should be paid and their bonddebts be reduced to fifteen hundred thousand pounds they might then and not till then divide eight per cent upon their capital and that whatever remained of their revenues and nett profits at home should be divided into four parts three of them to be paid into the exchequer for the use of the public and the fourth to be reserved as a fund either for the further reduction of their bonddebts or for the discharge of other contingent exigencies which the company might labor under but if the company were bad stewards and bad sovereigns when the whole of their nett revenue and profits belonged to themselves and were at their own disposal they were surely not likely to be better when threefourths of them were to belong to other people and the other fourth though to be laid out for the benefit of the company yet to be so under the inspection and with the approbation of other people  it might be more agreeable to the company that their own servants and dependants should have either the pleasure of wasting or the profit of embezzling whatever surplus might remain after paying the proposed dividend of eight per cent than that it should come into the hands of a set of people with whom those resolutions could scarce fail to set them in some measure at variance the interest of those servants and dependants might so far predominate in the court of proprietors as sometimes to dispose it to support the authors of depredations which had been committed in direct violation of its own authority with the majority of proprietors the support even of the authority of their own court might sometimes be a matter of less consequence than the support of those who had set that authority at defiance  the regulations of      accordingly did not put an end to the disorders of the companys government in india notwithstanding that during a momentary fit of good conduct they had at one time collected into the treasury of calcutta more than three millions sterling notwithstanding that they had afterward extended either their dominion or their depredations over a vast accession of some of the richest and most fertile countries in india all was wasted and destroyed they found themselves altogether unprepared to stop or resist the incursion of hyder ali and in consequence of those disorders the company is now      in greater distress than ever and in order to prevent immediate bankruptey is once more reduced to supplicate the assistance of government different plans have been proposed by the different parties in parliament for the better management of its affairs and all those plans seem to agree in supposing what was indeed always abundantly evident that it is altogether unfit to govern its territorial possessions even the company itself seems to be convinced of its own incapacity so far and seems upon that account willing to give them up to government  with the right of possessing forts and garrisons in distant and barbarous countries is necessarily connected the right of making peace and war in those countries the joint stock companies which have had the one right have constantly exercised the other and have frequently had it expressly conferred upon them how unjustly how capriciously how cruelly they have commonly exercised it is too well known from recent experience  when a company of merchants undertake at their own risk and expense to establish a new trade with some remote and barbarous nation it may not be unreasonable to incorporate them into a joint stock company and to grant them in case of their success a monopoly of the trade for a certain number of years it is the easiest and most natural way in which the state can recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive experiment of which the public is afterward to reap the benefit a temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated upon the same principles upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor and that of a new book to its author but upon the expiration of the term the monopoly ought certainly to determine the forts and garrisons if it was found necessary to establish any to be taken into the hands of government their value to be paid to the company and the trade to be laid open to all the subjects of the state by a perpetual monopoly all the other subjects of the state are taxed very absurdly in two different ways first by the high price of goods which in the case of a free trade they could buy much cheaper and secondly by their total exclusion from a branch of business which it might be both convenient and profitable for many of them to carry on it is for the most worthless of all purposes too that they are taxed in this manner it is merely to enable the company to support the negligence profusion and malversation of their own servants whose disorderly conduct seldom allows the dividend of the company to exceed the ordinary rate of profit in trades which are altogether free and very frequently makes it fall even a good deal short of that rate without a monopoly however a joint stock company it would appear from experience cannot long carry on any branch of foreign trade to buy in one market in order to sell with profit in another when there are many competitors in both to watch over not only the occasional variations in the demand but the much greater and more frequent variations in the competition or in the supply which that demand is likely to get from other people and to suit with dexterity and judgment both the quantity and quality of each assortment of goods to all these circumstances is a species of warfare of which the operations are continually changing and which can scarce ever be conducted successfully without such an unremitting exertion of vigilance and attention as cannot long be expected from the directors of a joint stock company the east india company upon the redemption of their funds and the expiration of their exclusive privilege have a right by act of parliament to continue a corporation with a joint stock and to trade in their corporate capacity to the east indies in common with the rest of their fellow subjects but in this situation the superior vigilance and attention of private adventurers would in all probability soon make them weary of the trade  an eminent french author of great knowledge in matters of political economy the abbe morellet gives a list of fiftyfive joint stock companies for foreign trade which have been established in different parts of europe since the year   00 and which according to him have all failed from mismanagement notwithstanding they had exclusive privileges he has been misinformed with regard to the history of two or three of them which were not joint stock companies and have not failed but in compensation there have been several joint stock companies which have failed and which he has omitted  the only trades which it seems possible for a joint stock company to carry on successfully without an exclusive privilege are those of which all the operations are capable of being reduced to what is called a routine or to such a uniformity of method as admits of little or no variation of this kind is first the banking trade secondly the trade of insurance from sire and from sea risk and capture in time of war thirdly the trade of making and maintaining a navigable cut or canal and fourthly the similar trade of bringing water for the supply of a great city  though the principles of the banking trade may appear somewhat abstruse the practice is capable of being reduced to strict rules to depart upon any occasion from those rules in consequence of some flattering speculation of extraordinary gain is almost always extremely dangerous and frequently fatal to the banking company which attempts it but the constitution of joint stock companies renders them in general more tenacious of established rules than any private copartnery such companies therefore seem extremely well fitted for this trade the principal banking companies in europe accordingly are joint stock companies many of which manage their trade very successfully without any exclusive privilege the bank of england has no other exclusive privilege except that no other banking company in england shall consist of more than six persons the two banks of edinburgh are joint stock companies without any exclusive privilege  the value of the risk either from fire or from loss by sea or by capture though it cannot perhaps be calculated very exactly admits however of such a gross estimation as renders it in some degree reducible to strict rule and method the trade of insurance therefore may be carried on successfully by a joint stock company without any exclusive privilege neither the london assurance nor the royal exchange assurance companies have any such privilege  when a navigable cut or canal has been once made the management of it becomes quite simple and easy and is reducible to strict rule and method even the making of it is so as it may be contracted for with undertakers at so much a mile and so much a lock the same thing may be said of a canal an aqueduct or a great pipe for bringing water to supply a great city such undertakings therefore may be and accordingly frequently are very successfully managed by joint stock companies without any exclusive privilege  to establish a joint stock company however for any undertaking merely because such a company might be capable of managing it successfully or to exempt a particular set of dealers from some of the general laws which take place with regard to all their neighbors merely because they might be capable of thriving if they had such an exemption would certainly not be reasonable to render such an establishment perfectly reasonable with the circumstance of being reducible to strict rule and method two other circumstances ought to concur first it ought to appear with the clearest evidence that the undertaking is of greater and more general utility than the greater part of common trades and secondly that it requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into a private copartnery if a moderate capital was sufficient the great utility of the undertaking would not be a sufficient reason for establishing a joint stock company because in this case the demand for what it was to produce would readily and easily be supplied by private adventurers in the four trades above mentioned both those circumstances concur  the great and general utility of the banking trade when prudently managed has been fully explained in the second book of this inquiry but a public bank which is to support public credit and upon particular emergencies to advance to government the whole produce of a tax to the amount perhaps of several millions a year or two before it comes in requires a greater capital than can easily be collected into any private copartnery  the trade of insurance gives great security to the fortunes of private people and by dividing among a great many that loss which would ruin an individual makes it fall light and easy upon the whole society in order to give this security however it is necessary that the insurers should have a very large capital before the establishment of the two joint stock companies for insurance in london a list it is said was laid before the attorney general of one hundred and fifty private insurers who had failed in the course of a few years  that navigable cuts and canals and the works which are sometimes necessary for supplying a great city with water are of great and general utility while at the same time they frequently require a greater expense than suits the fortunes of private people is sufficiently obvious  except the four trades above mentioned i have not been able to recollect any other in which all the three circumstances requisite for rendering reasonable the establishment of a joint stock company concur the english copper company of london the lead smelting company the glassgrinding company have not even the pretext of any great or singular utility in the object which they pursue nor does the pursuit of that object seem to require any expense unsuitable to the fortunes of many private men whether the trade which those companies carry on is reducible to such strict rule and method as to render it fit for the management of a joint stock company or whether they have any reason to boast of their extraordinary profits i do not pretend to know the mineadventurers company has been long ago bankrupt a share in the stock of the british linen company of edinburgh sells at present very much below par though less so than it did some years ago the joint stock companies which are established for the public spirited purpose of promoting some particular manufacture over and above managing their own affairs ill to the diminution of the general stock of the society can in other respects scarce ever fail to do more harm than good notwithstanding the most upright intentions the unavoidable partiality of their directors to particular branches of the manufacture of which the undertakers mislead and impose upon them is a real discouragement to the rest and necessarily breaks more or less that natural proportion which would otherwise establish itself between judicious industry and profit and which to the general industry of the country is of all encouragements the greatest and the most effectual
