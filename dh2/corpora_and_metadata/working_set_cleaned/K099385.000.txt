the essence of the douglas cause  to which is subjoined some observations on a pamphlet lately published entitled considerations  the douglas cause  london printed for j wilkie in st pauls church yard mdcclxvii price two shillings  advertisement neither the question with regard to general warrants nor any other question which has occurred for many years has been so alarming as the douglas cause which threatens a total destruction of the invaluable security of birthright in comparison of which all questions of liberty or property are but of inferior moment  a fellowcitizen warm in the cause of truth thinks he cannot better show his public spirit and concern for the happiness of society than in laying a fair state of this matter before the impartial people of these kingdoms that like a faithful watchman he may warn them of their danger  i was present during  mination of this cau  of session in scotla  notes and i cannon  the speeches of seve  been published in a   the greatest part of the arguments in this essay are selected from the genuine notes of these speeches some are also taken from the memorial for mr douglas and a variety of hints have been furnished from different periodical publications in particular i am indebted to a spirited article in the critical review  i beg leave to add that the plan the arrangement and many new thoughts are my own  the essence of the douglas cause importance of the douglas cause the douglas cause has now made a noise all over europe and indeed no cause ever came before a court of justice so interesting in its nature and of such universal importance in one view it is a question whether a young gentleman of distinguished merit the only remaining representative of the illustrious house of douglas is after nineteen years possession of his estate to be deprived of it and to be reduced to a situation worse than death  view it is a question  of birthright which ha  for ages is now to   the memorials  justice in this cause  has never occurred in  plaintiffs have with great expense industry and art collected an immense mass of materials which they have with equal expense industry and art contrived to arrange in such a manner as to carry a plausible appearance the defendant from the nature of judicial proceedings has been obliged to follow his enemies through all their doublings so that he too has been necessarily involved in a tedious train of arguments  an abridgement  received as the douglas cause is a question in which the impartial people of these kingdoms are very seriously concerned and there are few who can submit to the fatigue of discovering the truth in so motley a heap i would flatter myself that this essay will be favorably received   cause i am going to plead the cause of mr douglas i own i am most warmly interested for him but i trust that i have examined his cause with impartiality i shall write the following sheets with an  laudable intention the ar  to those who may ho a reading the facts can  any doubt for i shall not  without a reference to   this essay will consist of four parts this essay will consist of four parts  st i shall lay down the principles of law with regard to filiation or the state which every man holds in society and what ought to be the motives and conduct of those who carry on a process to deprive a subject of his birthright  dly i shall show the motives and conduct of the plaintiffs in the douglas cause  dly i shall examine the proof which has been brought against mr douglas and  thly i shall state the proof for mr douglas  part   filiation or birthright filiation or birthright is of all things the most valuable to mankind for all the blessings and comforts of life the succession of property and of honors all the rights and all the affections of blood flow from it therefore it is that the wisdom of law has been particularly careful that the birthright of the subject should be inviolably protected  what kind of certainty law requires in filiation we are not allowed to talk of filiation in the manner of scepticks who may raise innumerable doubts con every thing which occurs in  wife may be unfaithful  unfaithful and various  may be figured by whi  children can be introduce  there is no doubt but a variety of  cases have actually happened and therefore in a strict philosophical sense there is properly no certainty in filiation but it is the spirit of law to disregard such possible cases and not to look for a certainty in the abstract but a legal certainty for law like a kind parent ever watchful for the good of her children has established such solid rules as may check the uneasy waverings of skepticism and make mankind pass through life with tranquillity and satisfaction  acknowledgment of parents and general report sufficient therefore it is that according to law to ascertain the birthright of the subject so as to entitle him to succeed to the greatest estate and honors nothing more is required than his being acknowledged by two married persons as their child and being commonly reputed to be so this is a natural and an unsuspicious principle it is natural to suppose that people will not acknowledge and show parental fondness for children which are not their own and it is unsuspicious because it she sonable confidence in the good  without which our lives  indeed    the fountain of all  ld be insecure and  taken such pains to  preservation of their liberties and properties would be left in a wretched state of uncertainty with regard to that great right from whence all their liberties and properties are derived  a subject may be born in a foreign country the birth of a subject of any state may happen in a foreign country or at least in a distant colony great britain has now extended her dominion over a part of africa as well as over many distant islands and an immense continent in america it is therefore of infinite importance that the children of those who are born abroad should also have their birthrights secured to them  the law mindful of this of this the law has also been mindful for it is a principle in law that if a person is acknowledged by two married persons as their child and has in his favor the common fame or general belief of the country where he was born he is thereby entitled to the full possession of his state and birthright with all its privileges in every part of the globe and it will be in vain to object to  in any country that in that  have been reports of his  though there were no  country where he was   if this sacred right  by law it is evident  subjects who are born beyond seas would be inevitably exposed to the wicked designs of interested people at home  this strongly illustrated and brought home to the best families in these kingdoms nothing is now more common than for younger sons of the best families in these kingdoms to settle in distant countries and there are few families of which the succession does not in four or five generations devolve upon a distant branch they who are at home foreseeing this would have nothing more to do than to employ two or three villains to raise reports that the next heir of the family was an illegitimate or a supposititious child and in that manner the real representative and rightful heir of the noblest in europe might be injuriously prevented from enjoying the succession of his ancestors  alarming apprehensions of british merchants soldiers sailors and travelers should the law allow of this then the respectable body of british merchants established all over the world our soldiers and our sailors and even those whom bad health or curiosity may load into  ust all be subjected to the  of having their chil  spurious and robbed  themselves loaded with  uilty of one of the   a plaintiff in an action of partus suppositio bound to prove all holding it therefore as an inviolable principle of law that a subject acknowledged by a husband and wife as their child and believed to be so in the country where he was born is thereby fully vested in the possession of the sacred privilege of birthright i also hold that according to law on which we all depend for protection he must retain this possession till those who seek to deprive him of it do show that he enjoys it upon a false supposition  a defendant in an action of partus suppositio bound to prove no more than his legal possession he who is thus attacked finds himself entrenched in his legal possession he is bound to prove no circumstances with respect to his birth for he is a stranger to all those circumstances he like every one of us can only say such a man and his spouse always acknowledged me as their child and i have always been treated as such by the whole neighborhood and by every body in the country  if a defendant should bring more proofs their imperfection no argument it is therefore incumbent upon those who attack the birthright of a subject to prove their accusation and  to be allowed to argue from  tions which ingenuity  proofs which a person  think proper to bri  the great and materia  knowledgment of pa  belief of the country where he was born  any such additional proof must from the nature of the thing be imperfect any such additional proof which a defendant may choose to bring must in almost every case be exceedingly imperfect from the very nature of the thing to be proved the birth of a subject is a transient act which often happens unexpectedly at any rate it is an act which every circumstance both of nature and custom concurs to render as private as possible and therefore the evidence of an actual delivery will hardly ever be such evidence as courts of justice demand for the attestation of a fact  a charge of partus suppositio odious the plaintiffs therefore in a charge of partus suppositio have all to do and indeed they have a formidable task when they bring so odious a charge against a subject who is in full possession of his state  the plaintiffs proof must be direct not presumptive the proof which the plaintiffs in such a cause are bound to bring is a direct and  presumptive evidence is  all cases and is therefore  th caution but in a case  nnot be received at all  kness or any dubiety  ng loose the fabric of  ine us to acquiesce in the acknowledgment of parents correborated by universal fame  a trial of partus suppositio different from a trial of other crimes and therefore it requires a different evidence it is very false reasoning to argue that because presumptive evidence has been admitted by juries in trials of some crimes it should therefore be admitted in a trial of partus suppositio in a trial for murder or for robbery it is already certain that a man has been murdered or robbed so that it is certain a crime has been committed and as  interest republicae ne crimina maneant impunita it is the interest of the state that crimes should not pass unpunished it is necessary to have recourse to such evidence as the nature of the crime will admit but an accusation of partus suppositio is widely different for there that a crime has been committed is necessary to be proved we have nothing for it but the assertion of a plaintiff which may be unjust and therefore i deny that a presumptive evidence from circumstances all made to refer to a supposed crime can be allowed in an accusation of partus suppositio  not the interest of the  crimes where there may  and to admit of imp  order to add to the un  comforts and enjoymen  those principles by wh  mated to be good  he who would overthrow an established filiation must bring such a proof as renders the filiation impossible  these important principles of law become stronger by length of time these important principles of law become gradually stronger in proportion to the time that a subject has been in possession of his state because although he is originally obliged to bring no other proof but that of the acknowledgement of his parents and the belief of the country where he was born he may afterward be under a necessity of bringing more evidence in order to show the weakness or falsity of the proofs brought against him but if the action against him shall be long delayed the presumption of law in his favor will have grown up to a much greater degree of strength than if the action against him had been brought at an early period because from the gradual decay of memory and the unavoidable death of witnesses by the lapse of time a defendant cannot be reasonably supposed to bring such a proof at the distance of ten twelve or fifteen  be done at an early pe  ousand little circumstan  any years be totally in  by the art of coun  into arguments of sus   the motives for undertaking an action of partus suppositio should be most unexceptionable as an action of partus suppositio is an action solemn important and alarming to society the motives for undertaking it should be the most unexceptionable if it should appear that such an action is undertaken from motives of private pique or resentment it is to be looked upon with a jealous eye for such is human nature that our evil passions will influence us more than any other motive and they who would proceed with calmness and with justice in a matter of mere interest will be guilty of violence and of dishonesty when actuated by revenge  the conduct of plaintiffs in an action of partus suppositio should be particularly candid the conduct of such an action should be particularly candid for all who wish well to society should wish to have it found that no such atrocious crime has been committed every thing should therefore be carried on in the most open and unsuspicious manner were this crime to become frequent all the happiness of human life would be at an end  every instance of it must  diminution of our happiness  should be abandoned eno  vour by false evidence to  guilt of so horrid a nature  to be hunted down as  sassins  part   motives of the plaintiffs in the douglas cause the motives of the plaintiffs in the douglas cause will appear from the following circumstances  the family of hamilton have long had designs on the estate of douglas and actually obtained a settlement of the estate the family of hamilton and their adherents had long carried on designs to obtain the succession of the douglas estate on the decease of the late duke and had succeeded so far that the duke had actually made a settlement upon that family in prejudice of mr douglas his nephew the defendant in the douglas cause who was artfully represented to the duke as a supposititious child  this settlement was cancelled and the estate devised to the right heirs in this situation matters continued till after the dukes marriage when the duchess of douglas who was fully convinced of the iniquity of all the accusations brought against lady jane douglas sister of the duke and mother of the present defendant exerted herself with a spirit and generosity which will ever do her honor and was so happy as to undeceive the duke and to prevail with him  the settlement which he had  he family of hamilton in  right heirs  after  of  death  hamilton  the estate  male and loses his plea before the court of session  kes death a suit was  the court of session in  uke hamilton claiming  douglas as heir male but it was given against him by an almost unanimous decision there being but a single judge for sustaining his plea  it was thought this would have been first settled by appeal to the house of lords it was thought that the family of hamilton would immediately have carried this suit by appeal before the house of lords in order to have it finally settled whether or not they could have any claim upon the douglas estate and consequently if they had any business to interfere in the affairs of that family  instead of which the present suit was commenced instead of this the family of hamilton commenced the great suit known by the name of the douglas cause with intention to prove that the present defendant was in reality not the son of the lady jane douglas but a supposititious child picked up from the streets of paris  duke hamilton can have no interest in it in this duke hamilton could have no possible interest for if the estate of douglas should be found to be  heir male duke hamilton  take it up in prejudice  as well as of the other  and if it should be found  belonged to the heirs  the other heirs would cu  as effectually as  would do  on the contrary it is against the interest of that family nay so far was duke hamilton from having any interest in this cause that he was taking the direct method to prevent a chance which a branch of the family had of obtaining the estate of douglas  this clearly evident for the late duke of douglas a little before his death made a settlement in which he provided that failing his nephew mr douglas the present defendant his estate should go to lord douglas hamilton the present duke of hamiltons brother by the law of scotland a deed made upon deathbed is not valid if challenged by the next heir but it might reasonably be supposed that if the family of hamilton had behaved in a proper manner toward mr douglas he would as soon as he came of age have confirmed the dying intentions of his uncle in favor of lord douglas hamilton whereas it may well be believed that after the family of hamilton have done all in their power to blacken the memory of his parents and to ruin himself  douglas would hardly choose  state to any of their race  there  motiv  plainti  cause  revenges  the family of hamilton  interest in this suit but on  have certainly been acting  against  interest they can have no motive to carry it on but revenge against mr douglas as the innocent cause of their having been disappointed in their schemes of obtaining the succession to the estate of douglas  the conduct of the plaintiffs the principal point in this cause the conduct of the plaintiffs in the douglas cause merits a very particular consideration if we consider it slightly and as a circumstance of little consequence we cannot do justice to the defendant because the conduct of the cause has been so extraordinary i will say more has been so iniquitous on the part of the plaintiff that it will account to us for many of the proofs which they have brought and for the defects in the proof which has been brought by the defendant  they delay their suit till after the death of lady jane douglas and fourteen years after the birth of the defendant lady jane douglas spouse of john stewart esquire afterward sir john stewart of grandtully was delivered at paris of two male twins by monsieur la mar manmidwife on the  0th of july      in the house of madame le brune mrs helen hewit the attendant of lady jane being pr  was what the plaintiffs  but they never attemp  after the death of lady jane  fourteen years after the  douglas  mr andrew stuart their agent is sent privately to paris and a criminal process is raised before the tournelle instead of applying to the court of session for a commission to take a proof so that fairness might have been ensured to both parties mr andrew stuart duke hamiltons agent was sent privately to paris where he employed one danjon a procureur with several other french agents and after various secret enquiries and consultations a criminal process was raised before the tournelle treating sir john stewart and mrs hewit as already convicted of the crime of partus suppositio and insisting to have them punished accordingly  this process an insult upon justice this process was in reality an insult upon justice it was a mock accusation as it related to two british subjects who were not under the jurisdiction of france and therefore could not be punished by the courts of france  the real intention of it to obtain partial evidence the real intention of it was to obtain partial depositions in support of the plaintiffs cause from witnesses examined in a  ner at the instance of one  the knowledge of the other  john stewart or mrs  ng to paris to give assist  endant since however  ey had varied from the  sitions they would have been put to the torture  the horrid nature of the tournelle the nature of a tournelle examination is this a plainte or accusation drawn up by a party in such terms as he thinks proper and no doubt plainly calculated to lead a witness is given in to the judge this plainte is read over in the hearing of the witness who is then called upon to tell what he knows concerning it what the witness swears in consequence of this plainte is immediately written by the grefier or secretary who attends upon the judge and when once so written a witness is for ever after nailed down and must tell the precise same story at the risque of the most dreadful punishment there is here no opportunity for an opposite party to ask such questions as may make a witness recollect himself when in a mistake or as may entrap him when uttering falsehoods no the plainte is read over the witness tells his tale and to this tale he must ever after strictly and invariably adhere an establishment not to be found in any country which knows not the torture and therefore it was well said by  that if there was a bri  france and england so as  nelle could walk over he  ultima thule  the plaintiffs attempt to stab their antagonist in the dark here then the plaintiffs  an attempt to stab their antagonist in the dark and to gain a most undue advantage over the defendant  they publish an infamous libel called a monitoire but not content with employing the tournelle that horrid engine of tyrannical power they had also recourse to the terrors of popish superstition application was made to the church and the archbishop of paris most readily issued what was called a monitoire important an infamous libel in which the whole story which the plaintiffs wished to prove was fully narrated nay such descriptions were given of the persons accused that not a man or woman in all france could fail to form ideas of sir john stewart and mrs hewit so that every interested wretch and every deluded creature were so conducted to the point in view that a very little art or a very little imagination was sufficient to make them swear what served the plaintiffs purpose  this more atrocious than even in the cruel case of calas this monitoire was more atrocious than usual as it was more express and  to show it at once in all its  aver that even in the ar  of france such a moni  never known it was  that in the case of calas where  equence was to assemble such  that an aged father was cruelly broken upon the wheel as the alleged murderer of his son though he was afterward when it was alas too late clearly proved to have been innocent  the abhorrence which these proceedings inspire can we without detestation and abhorrence read of such proceedings as these in order to influence a british cause begun without any interest on the part of duke hamilton the motives of which were vindictive and it is intention to stigmatize with infamy two persons of rank and character who are now gone and unable to answer for themselves and to forfeit the birthright of one of the noblest of his majestys subjects  the iniquitous effects of the french proceedings clearly discovered by the justice of the house of peers but i am not under the necessity of only throwing out general declamation upon the dangerous nature of these french proceedings which have been so severely condemned by the house of peers i am in condition to give pointed and distinct evidence of the miserable effects which they have produced  enabled to do chiefly by  supreme court which  tiffs to make a producti  containing the informa  had so unjustly obtained  mr andrew stuart changes his ground with regard to the pregnancy mr andrew stuart in his plainte to the tournelle says in so many words that lady jane put on the appearance of pregnancy purs pr p  0    this we may well believe to have been the case whether the birth was true or supposititious and we must believe that all who saw lady jane concurred in telling him she had that appearance but mr andrew stuart seems afterward to have changed his ground and was desirous to prove that lady jane had not even the appearance of pregnancy  mademoiselle hibert assures mr andrew stuart that lady jane appeared to be with child in mr andrew stuarts journal we find that he had a conversation with mademoiselle louise hibert who told him expressly that lady jane had the appearance of pregnancy and appeared to be five months gone with child  mademoiselle hibert after the tournelle swears that lady jane did not appear to be with child yet when this same mademoiselle hibert comes to be examined after the tournelle proceedings and monitoire she swears expressly that she observed no appearance of pregnancy about lady jane purs pr p  0    francois la mar informs danjou the plaintiffs procureur of the connection between pierre la mar and madame le brun in danjou duke hamiltons french procu first note we find that he had  with francois la mar  la mar who told  readily sur le champ  that his brother pierre la mar the accoucheur was in correspondence and intimacy with madam le brun that his brother may have taught her midwifry and that he himself was acquainted with her def pr p  0     francois la mar conceals this information from those acting for the defendant in danjous second note we find francois la mar telling this agent of the plaintiffs that the other party had been with him and that he had informed them of all that he knew except as to madam la brun which shows that francois la mar was by this time pretty well disposed to conceal what might favor the defenders def pr p  0     francois la mar swears point blank the reverse of what he told danjou when francois la mar comes to be examined by the commissioners of the court of session he swears point blank the reverse of what he had at first of his own accord told to danjou purs pr p       madam michelle informs the plaintiffs agents that lady jane had all the appearance of being newly brought to bed in one of the plaintiffs french memorials we find that they had a conversation with madam michelle who told them that lady jane had all the appearance of a woman newly brought to bed  madam michelle upon oath minces this down to a fickly air but after the tournelle  monitoire madam michelle  the matter and when up  only that lady jane had lair malade a fickly air  p     and p       m gilles an acquaintance of pierre la mar is discovered a french counsel employed for mr douglas having heard that mr gilles surgeon in paris had been an acquaintance of pierre la mar applied to m morand a surgeon of eminence desiring him to enquire at m gilles what he remembered of sundry particulars concerning which a note containing questions was given to m morand  messieurs morand and moreau have questions put to m gilles monsieur morand not being particularly acquainted with m gilles employed m moreau first surgeon of the hotel dieu to put the questions and accordingly m moreau returned the questions with answers dictated by m gilles and written by m moreau in his presence  p       m gilless answers are clear and strong in favor of the defendant the substance of these answers was that m gilles was told by pierre la mar that he was to bring a stranger lady to bed who might make his fortune and that he had actually delivered her of twins that monsieur la mar mention that he had the care of a child that  menilmontain that m  that this stranger lady was brought to bed of two children in the house of madame le brun  monsieur morand and moreau are gentlemen of undoubted character both m morand and m moreau are gentlemen of the highest reputation in their profession and it cannot be supposed that they would use the least endeavor to influence a witness or obtain unfair answers from him so that we must believe that these answers given by m gilles were the genuine truth  m gilles after the monitoire and tournelle denies upon oath what he had formerly said yet when m gilles has heard of the monitoire and tournelle process he swears positively def pr p     that he does not recollect to have heard from monsieur la mar that the foreign lady was brought to bed of twins that he never knew a woman of the name of le brun nor did he ever hear the said m la mar say that he was acquainted with a woman of that name and as to the time of the delivery he of his own accord observed that it could not but be before the year       the evident patiality  m gilles such is the oath of monsieur gilles after having given the pointed answers so favorable to the defendant which have been above recited and it is  particular that this man wh  oath has for decencys sake  some circumstances which he had formerly told is so apprehensive least the circumstances might in any respect assist the defendant that he takes care to cut them off effectually from this cause by a round assertion that the delivery could not but be before the year       it was foreseen by wise and upright men that justice would here be perverted so fatal to the defendant were these most iniquitous proceedings in france which every wise and upright man condemned from the first moment they were mentioned because it was evident that they would tend to pervert justice  how far they have done so the instances selected from the proof will be sufficient to show  a shocking fact which the plaintiffs have not attempted to justify but there is a fact in the conduct of the plaintiffs which they have not attempted to justify in their elaborate memorial nor can i see indeed the least possibility of justifying it as it is a thing clearly proved and of a most shocking nature  the plaintiffs french agents in despair betake themselves to the book of michelle it appears that when the plaintiffs french agents were despairing of making any overies in paris they at last fell  book of michelle an innkeep  bore that mr fluratl a  and his family had come to this michelles upon the  th of july      and remained there three weeks this was blazed abroad as a most important discovery since it would effectually prove an alibi on the  0th of july the day on which lady jane is said to have been delivered at madame le bruns it was affirmed by mr andrew stuart that the name of fluratl was written by sir john stewarts hand with which he was well acquainted def pr p  0   and then a strong argument of suspicion was drawn from sir johns having taken a false name append to def memor p    this book of michelle having been carefully perused and commented upon was by a warrant from the neverfailing tournelle locked up so that no person could have access to see it but upon the plaintiffs application  it becomes necessary to prove the contents of michelles book in the course of the proof it was necessary to have evidence of what was contained in this book the proper way of proving which was no doubt by producing the book but the plaintiffs agents knew well that it would not bear examination and that all they had so pompously boasted of this book would appear to be downright fiction they were therefore reduced to a  dilemma  a desperate expedient resolved upon but they had now gone too far to retreat and a desperate expedient was resolved upon if it should pass their cause was infallibly won and if it should be discovered they had already stood the storm which had been raised by the monitoire and tournelle and they were pretty well hardened to the most severe accusations  duruisseau is brought forth to swear with regard to michelles book this desperate expedient was to bring forth a champion in swearing they adduced one monsieur durruisseau a gentleman with a great many sounding titles after his name  maitre pierre charles duruisseau conseiller du roi commissaire enqueteur et examinateur au chatelet  this man had the custody of the book and had examined it carefully and he deliberately swears that he examined michelles book  en a constate letat and that the article of fluratl did not at all appear to him any way suspicious so much the rather that there were the visa of the inspecteur before and after the article in question that he does not perfectly remember if the visa which are put before and after this article are of the  th with the article but re  there are upon the same  this article is wrote and sub  eto some other articles wrote of which the deponent does not recollect the number neither does the deponent recollect if the visa of the inspecteur does immediately follow the article of fluratl or is put after one or several other articles but he is certain there is a visa on the same page on which the article in question is wrote that so far as he can remember the article which goes before that of fluratl is of a date anteriour to that of the  th of july that he asked michelle of whose hand writing was the article of fluratl and that michelle answered the deponent that this article was neither of his writing nor that of his wife and that he presumed that it was of the person who called himself fluratl  that michelles livre du commissaire which is brought to him commences subsequent to the    0 and that he never saw michelles livre du commissaire for the year      that the article of fluratl appeared to him of a hand writing distinct and different from all the articles both upon that and the next page and that it was the best wrote of the articles on that or the next page  it appears from a cloud of evidence that michelles book  not be true and it is produced after this it appeared from a cloud of evidence that sir john and lady jane did not come to michelles till the  of july michelles book was their  er of importance so it was produced in order to remove a suspicion thrown out on the part of the defendant that the article fluratl had been superinduced by the plaintiffs agents this suspicion was indeed removed but when the book was produced it showed why the plaintiffs agents had kept it locked up and why they had brought forth a man to swear to its contents  the shameful perjury of duruisseau upon examining the book what a shameful figure does this duruisseau make for it appears that the article fluratl is posterior to an article of the   th july that there was no visa of the inspecteur as sworn to by duruisseau that there were several other articles on the same and preceding page of the same handwriting with that of fluratl  michelle positively swears he never told this man that the article was written by fluratl himself but always said it was written by the maid of the house and though this man swears that he never saw michelles livre du commissaire for the      yet that book was afterward recovered and it appears that this very duruisseau had written in it a very few days before his examination  observations on this glaring fact  this glaring fact a few obvious reflections arise  the plaintiffs french agents having examined michelles book must have been in the knowledge of duruisseaus perjury the plaintiffs french agents had seen this book and examined it with care can they therefore deny that they were in the knowledge of duruisseaus perjury  it is therefore to be inferred that the plaintiffs french agents have been guilty of subornation of perjury it is an old maxim nemo gratis malus no body will be wicked for nothing it is not then to be believed that duruisseau submitted to prostitute himself to this shameful perjury without being rewarded we are therefore well warranted to infer that the plaintiffs french agents have been guilty of subornation of perjury  the plaintiffs french agents would go any length and can bear no credit i ask then what lengths would not these french agents go in the prosecution of their cause and i desire to know if any credit can be given to the proofs which they have reared up  if a party is proved to have suborned even one witness it must contaminate the whole of his proof as this is only the essence of the douglas cause i do not mention various perjuries which appear in the plaintiffs proof particularly that of megnon but it is certain and established law that if a party shall be proved to have  even one witness to perjure himself this vitiates and contaminates the whole of his proof for no man can rely upon it  noble saying of a great man it was nobly said by a great man in vain are judges learned  in vain are judges upright if the channels of justice are corrupted  that the channels of justice have been corrupted in the douglas cause shown from the proof that the channels of justice have been corrupted in the douglas cause i hope i have shown beyond dispute from an investigation of the proof  this confirmed by the solemn oaths of two judges of the court of session besides this is confirmed by the high authority of two judges of the court of session the lords gardenston and monboddo who were both in france as counsel for mr douglas have both declared upon their great oaths that the french proof is corrupted by the atrocious proceedings of the plaintiffs these judges have done no less since they have solemnly affirmed it in judgment and as these two only of the whole fifteen had access to know the real truth in this important affair we cannot give faith to the proof which has been brought against mr douglas without doing a manifest injury to both these judges  the conduct of the plaintiffs such that no jury could pronounce a verdict upon their evidence  recedented and most atrocious  of this cause has been such that the plaintiffs proof can bear no faith and were their proof really as strong as they have vaunted it to be i do maintain that no jury could pronounce a verdict upon such rotten evidence  the douglas cause may be decided on conduct alone therefore the douglas cause may admit of a very short decision nor is there any occasion for taking the trouble to examine the immense proofs which have been collected with regard to it since after all no man can venture to decide upon these proofs  part iii examination of the proof brought against mr douglas as however the plaintiffs have succeeded so far as to obtain a decree of the court of session by the casting vote of the lord president i shall examine the proof which they have brought against mr douglas  it consists of two general heads it consists of two general heads  st things absolutely exclusive of the defendants being the son of lady jane douglas and  dly circumstances which look like presumptions against it  first general head contains two articles absolutely conclusive against mr douglas if true under the first head are two articles  st that lady jane was not pregnant and  dly that upon the  0th of july she was in the house of godefroi  innkeeper in paris and so consequently could not be delivered that day at the house of madame le brun  the age of lady jane now given up though the very foundation of all this calumny with regard to the pregnancy the objection arising from the age of lady jane is now given up though it is material to observe that it was her age alone which originally furnished a pretense to her enemies to raise a calumny against her  no proof that lady jane feigned pregnancy the proofs by which the plaintiffs have attempted to show that lady jane simulated or feigned pregnancy are the weakest that can possibly be imagined it will be shown in the fourth part of this essay that a cloud of witnesses believed lady jane pregnant whereas not a single evidence has been brought who even pretends to have had a suspicion that her appearance of pregnancy was false or affected  though one should have thought this would have been the strength of their cause  lady janes being pregnant evident to multitudes but a fact which was open to the observation of multitudes was too stubborn even for duke hamiltons agents with all their art they were therefore obliged to desist from attacking where there was a fair field for investigation  the plaintiffs artfully avoid the natural order of this cause and attempt another alibi they betook themselves to what from the very nature of the thing must be private and where there was room for the execution of their dark designs dont talk of pregnancy say they it could not be for there was no delivery we can prove lady jane to have been on the  0th of july in the house of godefroi at the hotel de chaalons for she entered to that inn upon the  th of july and did not leave it till the   th and this we can prove by the books of that inn and by the oaths of godefroi and his wife  the plaintiffs themselves at first gave no credit to the evidence of this alibi and it is probable no such evidence did then exist before examining the evidence of this alibi at godefrois it is of consequence to observe that the plaintiffs themselves at the beginning of the cause and for a long time afterward did not give the least credit to that evidence for we have seen that they betook themselves to another alibi at michelles totally contradictory to the alibi at godefrois and therefore it is probable that godefroi and his wife did not say at first what they swear now  the first alibi stronger than this though now allowed to be false it is also of consequence to state the strong evidence which the plaintiffs reared up for the alibi at michelles  the first alibi proved by madame michelle madame michelle swore that in the book of the inspecteur deposited at the tournelle there is an article which bears that one monsieur fluratl a scotsman and his family entered to the hotel danjou kept by her and her husband on the  th of july      that this article was inserted by the hand of marie malisset who was at that time servant in the said hotel that the said marie wrote that article the same day that the gentleman entered and that it was in presence of the deponent purs pr p     that all those who came to lodge at her house were inserted in the book of the inspecteur at least that it should be so and that she does not believe that she failed in that so much the rather because it is the interest of those who keep houses not to omit to insert their lodgers in the book of the inspecteur which serves them for a rule to fix the epoch of the payment which runs from the day when the apartments are hired purs pr p       the first alibi proved by monsieur michelle monsieur michelle husband to the preceding witness swore that the same day that sir john and lady jane arrived the girl marie asked the gentlemans name and inserted it the same day in the book of the inspecteur purs pr p       the force of these depositions from these depositions it was proved that sir john stewart under the designation of fluratl was entered in the book of the inspecteur on the  th of july the very day of his arrival and that as this book fixed the time from which the room rent was payable sir john had paid rent at michelles from the  th day of july downwards  the first alibi proved by madame blainville madam blainville a person who lodged in michelles house swore that sir john and lady jane entered to michelles in the beginning of july she does not exactly know the day purs pr p      and from the account this witness gives of the transactions of sir john and lady jane it would appear that they were about twenty days in the hotel before she left it which was on the   th of july so that her deposition makes their entry correspond with the book of the inspecteur as sworn to by m and madame michelle  the first alibi proved by breval breval a periwig maker soninlaw to michelle swore that sir john and his company came to michelles in the month of july and went away about the month of august after having staid as he believes a little less than a month purs pr p       the first alibi proved by madame favre madam favre employed by sir john and lady jane as a nurse swore that she kept the child at her own house two or three weeks after having passed two or three nights in the hotel d anjou purs pr p      so that the deposition of this woman also corresponded with the story of sir john and lady jane having arrived at michelles upon the  th of july because it was an agreed point by all parties that sir john and lady jane left michelles about the second or third of august and consequently could not have been there so long a time as was deposed to unless they had entered upon the eighth of july according to the book of the inspecteur  the first alibi completed by duruisseau to complete the system duruisseau was brought forth as a man who being of better rank and character and an officer of police might gain more credit and he swore in the strong and pointed manner which we have seen  michelle and his wife have sworn falsely what michelle and his wife have sworn as to this article of fluratl being written the day of the arrival of sir john stewart and that the book of the inspecteur was the rule for stating the rent of the rooms is certainly falsely sworn because the article immediately preceding was dated the   th of july so that it is impossible that the article of fluratl could be written till after the   th  blainville breval and favre have sworn falsely if sir john and his company did not arrive till after the   th then blainville breval and favre have also sworn falsely as to the time of sir johns residence in the house  duruisseau grossly perjured and his perjury and subornation sufficient to destroy the plaintiffs plea duruisseau has already been considered he is indeed the capital figure in the abandoned group his perjury is gross and notorious and cannot be palliated duruisseaus perjury is of itself sufficient to destroy the plaintiffs plea as it is manifest that he has been suborned he was brought to swear solely to the contents of michelles book with which the plaintiffs french agents were well acquainted and as they might have produced the book itself what reason can we possibly assign for their bringing duruisseau to swear to its contents except their intending that he should give false evidence concerning it as he has accordingly done  in considering the new alibi we must keep in mind the falsity of the evidence as to the original alibi therefore in considering the new alibi at godefrois the falsity of the evidence with respect to the original alibi at michelles must be kept in view and the evidence brought at the last hour of this odious process will be examined with a suspicious eye  two things necessary to make good the alibi at godefrois to make good the alibi at godefrois two things are necessary  st that godefrois books be regularly kept  dly that sir john stewart and his company should be found in them  godefrois books considered as to the regularity of these books upon a careful consideration of them it appears that they are on the contrary most irregular  godefrois books explained they are of two kinds a household book in order to account with the guests and a police book in order to show an exact list of the guests to the inspecteur of police who visits all the inns of paris by public authority  the apparent irregularity of godefrois books it appears that many people are entered in the household book who are not entered in the police book and on the other hand that many are entered in the police book who are not entered in the household book so that notwithstanding of that accurate police which our neighbors would fondly display as one of those advantages which they enjoy above this free country though it may impose upon superficial people is indeed but the phantom of french vanity  the irregularity of godefrois books shown from the oath of his wife nay it is acknowledged by madame godefroi that persons who come to this house at night and go away in the morning may happen not to be marked down in any way purs pr p      and she has positively deposed that her house containing fifteen beds was generally full purs pr p      yet during the whole time that lady jane and sir john are pretended to have been in this inn and when godefroi has positively sworn that they were lodged in the second story for want of room there are only two persons lodged in this large inn according to the books and at no time during the years      and      can the plaintiffs show from the books that the house was full  farther proof of the irregularity of godefrois books it is therefore certain that many guests must have lodged in godefrois without being marked in the book since it cannot be presumed that so great a number happened all to come at night and go away in the morning as mr godefrois inn is not like an inn for passengers upon a great road but is in the city of paris to which people resort to stay some time and at least a third if not one half of these people who put up at godefrois stay with him during their residence at paris  no dependence to be had upon godefrois books therefore godefrois books are so imperfect and irregular no dependence can be had upon them  godefrois books though regular could be of no avail unless sir john stewart is found in them but allowing godefrois books to be perfect and regular they surely can be of no avail here unless sir john stewart and lady jane douglas be found in them  the plaintiffs fondly attempt to apply a blank article to sir john stewart in what manner have the plaintiffs shown this a blank article is pointed out which must be owned appears to apply to three persons but how is this blank article to be applied to sir john stewart lady jane douglas and mrs hewit  the incredible oaths of godefroi and his wife by the oaths of godefroi and his wife who swear it applies to these three persons although it was fifteen years since they had been in their house and they had never heard or even thought of them since and although they could fill up no other blank article in the same manner  the new evidence of the plaintiffs inconclusive so turns out the new evidence of the plaintiffs if the birthright and every thing that is valuable to a british subject is to be taken away by such evidence the freedom which our forefathers have purchased to us with so much blood and treasure is indeed but a slender inheritance  godefrois tale improbable at first view the tale told by godefroi is at first view exceedingly improbable the price at his inn is three livres or half a crown english a day for lodging a bottle of wine and two meals viz dinner and supper the price of the wine is twenty four sous or one shilling english the price of the room to those who only sleep and go away in the morning is ten sous or five pence english therefore there remained only thirteen pence english for two meals and attendance through the day if any man can believe that lady jane douglas and sir john stewart were served in the expensive city of paris and in their own apartments at the miserable rate of thirteen pence each a day it is what never happened before nor will ever happen again to any british person whatever much less to people of fashion recommended by the chief magistrate of rheims as was the case with sir john and lady jane and it is in proof that when they were at michelles where their rank was not known as at godefrois they lived at more than double the expense purs pr p     and p     which it is pretended they did at godefrois  farther improbability of godefrois tale godefrois tale is farther improbable because it represents sir john and lady jane as following a different method from what they used to do madame michelle has sworn that they paid in ready money any thing that she may have furnished them purs pr p      it is therefore most reasonable to suppose that they paid all ready money at godefrois  godefrois oath felo de se but luckily for mr douglas godefrois oath is so contradictory that it is felo de se  godefrois book contains only those who eat at the ordinary for it is acknowledged purs pr p     that sir john and his family were entertained in their own apartments and yet godefroi and his wife swears that the article in this household book applies to them although the household book is indisputably kept for those only who eat at the ordinary which is plain from this that every person whose name is there inserted is charged equally high  sir john and his family did not eat at the ordinary so it is impossible they could be in godefrois book as therefore sir john and his family eat in their own apartments it is impossible that an article in the ordinary book of the inn can be applied to them  this is evident to all who have traveled in france this is evident to all who have had occasion to travel in france and indeed it is plain that an innkeeper can entertain a dozen or twenty people at one table at a much lower rate than he can entertain the same number of people in separate companies  duke hamiltons agents though artful have been inadvertent in the article of godefroi the duke of hamiltons agents who in most instances appear so artful have been a little inadvertent in this great article of godefroi whose character and that of his wife they have highly extolled  it would have been better for them to have had no more to do with books it would have been better for them to have had no more to do with books of which one should think they got enough at michelles it would have been better to have made godefroi and his wife swear from memory alone that sir john and his company lodged with them on the  0th of july      their astonishing memories would then have at least had a fair field and they who are disposed to give credit to such memories could not have been startled by obstacles which to common understandings must appear unsurmountable  it is undeniably shown that there is no such proof against mr douglas as the law requires having thus shown that the books of godefroi with the oaths of him and his wife are unworthy of credit and as nothing of any weight has been proved to invalidate the strong evidence of lady janes pregnancy there is not in the huge volume of the plaintiffs proof any circumstance absolutely exclusive of the defendants being the son of lady jane douglas and of consequence no such proof as the law requires to deprive a subject of his birthright in which he is established by the acknowledgment of his parents and common fame and which mr douglas has had solemnly confirmed to him by the verdict of a respectable jury  second general head of the plaintiffs proof circumstances like presumptions the second general head of the plaintiffs proof consists of circumstances which look like presumptions against the defendant  these to be considered not as material to the cause but in order to wipe off the aspersions of malice i enter upon the consideration of these not that i think them material in judging of this great cause but that i am anxious to wipe off those foul aspersions which malice has thrown upon the memories of sir john stewart and lady jane douglas and upon the honor of a young gentleman whose spirit upon this trying occasion proves him to be of noble blood  one circumstance only external of these circumstances or presumptive proofs there is one only which may be called external all the rest arise from the conduct of sir john and lady jane  the external circumstance is the enlevements the single external circumstance is the enlevements of which we have heard so much that is to say that in the year      when sir john and lady jane produced a young child to the world a young child was carried off from his parents and that in the year      when sir john and lady jane brought a child sixteen months old to rheims a child about sixteen months old was carried off from his parents and that both these enlevements happened in the city of paris  these enlevements have been trumpeted abroad and a foolish calculation has been made with regard to them these enlevements have made much noise and have been trumpeted by the plaintiffs as amazing discoveries nay in the memorial before the grave court of session a foolish calculation has been inserted to make shallow people imagine that there was mathematical demonstration against the defendant  these enlevements have nothing to do with this cause but when these enlevements are attentively considered they have nothing to do with the present cause  mignons child shown to have nothing to do with this cause the first child which was that of one mignon a glassgrinder who is alleged to be mr douglas had blue eyes and a fair complexion purs pr p      whereas the child produced by sir john and lady jane at rheims had black eyes and a dark complexion def pr p  0   the color of a childs eyes and complexion will not change from blue to black and from fair to dark in traveling from paris to rheims  sanrys child shown to have nothing to do with this cause the second child which was that of one sanry a ropedancer could both walk and speak a little at the time it was carried off purs pr p      whereas sholto the second child could neither walk nor speak at the time it was seen in london def pr p      which was a good while after the time of the enlevement of sanrys child and it is further as clear as writings and witnesses can make any fact in the world that this child was carried off after sir john had left france and when he and lady jane and their two children were living in london purs pr p           all the other circumstances the conduct of sir john and lacy jane all the other circumstances of presumption against the defendant arise from the conduct of sir john and lady jane  sir john and lady jane not now alive to explain their conduct in considering these it is proper to observe that we are considering the conduct of two persons who are not now alive to explain to us all the motives of it nor perhaps were they alive would they be able to recollect all the motives at this great distance of time  yet several of these circumstances accounted for very naturally yet several pieces of their conduct which at first sight appears suspicious may be accounted for very naturally  sir john and lady janes concealment at paris accounted for their concealment at paris is one of the strongest of these circumstances but let us remember their situation at that time it has been solemnly deposed to that they were then very poor we are therefore bound to believe they were so the bill of      livres which sir john carried with him from rheims was nothing to a man of his character who was so dissipated so profuse and i will say so generous that upon his receiving a sum of money no body could say how much of it was engaged for debt or indeed if half an hour after a six pence of it would be in his pocket  sir john and lady jane were anxious to conceal from the duke of douglas their being at paris and this fully explained as i would not split hairs about every trifle which has been the great art of the plaintiffs i shall not insist that sir john and lady jane were in real poverty but surely it cannot be denied that they at the time pretended poverty for they wrote to the duke of douglas in a very affecting strain upon that head and they borrowed money from m andrieux at rheims with whom they had then very little connection that being the case they were anxious to conceal from the duke their having gone to paris for said they the duke will be offended at our seeming extravagance and will very readily observe here are two people crying for want and yet they have left rheims and have taken a foolish journey to paris to send money to such people would be like throwing it into a sieve  therefore they used so many methods of concealment sir john and lady jane were thus in a dilemma she could give no good reason for having left rheims as there was very able assistance to be had there for women with child she had run off in a pannick as women in that situation do often take most unaccountable pannicks she and her husband therefore thought they had nothing for it but if possible to keep this journey from the knowledge of the duke therefore it was that they lived in a private manner at paris therefore it was that they dated their letters at rheims therefore it was that sir john though very fond of his countrymen prevailed with himself to refrain at this time from seeing them and so apprehensive were he and lady jane that their being at paris should get air that they did not trust even johnston a cousin of mrs hewits with the secret  other circumstances admit of a double interpretation other pieces of their conduct will admit of a double interpretation such as their leaving their maid servants at rheims it may be said that they left their maids because they did not choose to make them privy to the shameful plot which they were carrying on but on the other hand upon the supposition of the imposture would they not have taken these maids as accomplices of the fraud if they were accomplices as the plaintiffs themselves positively affirms with respect to isabel walker they certainly would not leave them at rheims when they could be of so much use to them at paris were it only to have served as witnesses to the supposed birth if they were not accomplices then they were both unsuspicious testimonies in behalf of the defendant and if their testimony be true there is an end of the plaintiffs plea  the maids being left at rheims strongly against the plaintiffs so that this circumstance of leaving the maids is the most unlucky that the plaintiffs could possibly have selected nor can i really see how it is possible for them to extricate themselves from the difficulties in which it places them  leaving the maids difficult to be explained it must be owned that we cannot account for these maids being left but one undeniable piece of evidence in this cause may serve to make us pay little regard to such circumstances  leaving the manservant a circumstance much more suspicious when sir john and lady jane came to liege in their way to paris they left there their man servant who was a frenchman this circumstance the plaintiffs insisted was strongly suspicious because they were leaving this frenchman behind them at the very time when he could be of most use to them  though sir john could give no account of this it is now by good providence clearly explained when sir john stewart was asked what was the reason of their leaving this manservant he could give no account of it whatever and we should now have heard it urged as an undeniable circumstance of guilt had not the wife of this man by good providence been alive and told that her husband was pressed by sir john and lady jane to go along with them and that the reason why he did not go to france was his having been a deserter from that service def pr p       therefore all the other circumstances might have been explained had they been taken in time not one of all the circumstances is so strong as this which has been so happily cleared up and therefore we are to infer that had they all been enquired into at an earlier period they would all have been as plain to us as this now is  alleged contradictory accounts by sir john lady jane and mrs hewit much has been said of contradictory accounts which have been given by sir john lady jane and mrs hewit  this not true as to any material circumstance but one mistake which was soon corrected in the first place this is not true as to any material circumstance except in one instance when sir john was asked the name of the person in whose house lady jane was brought to bed which he did not recollect at the time and mentioned michelles instead of le bruns which however he corrected in a very short time after  their varying in trifles a strong argument against an imposture their varying in trifles is rather a strong argument against an imposture being committed for if that had been the case a tale would have been concerted and uniformly told to forget circumstances or remember them in various ways is what we commonly observe in the course of human life and i can appeal to any two of my readers who have been present at the same transactions and desire them to try if after some years have elapsed they do not vary in the remembrance of many particulars one memory is more distinct and comprehensive than another and some people are apt to confound the ideas suggested by fancy with those preserved by memory as was the case with sir john stewart and is the case with most people of lively imaginations  sir john lady jane and mrs hewit were all along consistent in the great lines of their story it is however certain that sir john lady jane and mrs hewit did all along give the great lines of their story with perfect consistency  objection from what lady jane is said to have told to the countess of stair one objection has been made to this it has been said that lady jane told a very different tale to the countess of stair to whom she said that she was delivered immediately on her coming to paris  answer   this alleged by only a single witness to this it is answered  st that it is only proved by the oath of the honorable mrs primrose who swears that she heard her mother the countess of stair say what she heard from lady jane therefore this is at best but the hearsay of a hearsay which is not legal evidence  answer   this witness certainly in a mistake shown from the story itself but  dly it is certain that from inadvertency from dullness of hearing or from a fallacious memory people who are equally honest will give very different accounts of what they heard in conversation and it is evident at first view that one of these ladies either the countess of stair or mrs primrose must have been in a mistake with regard to lady janes saying that she was delivered immediately upon her arrival in paris which was upon the  th of july because we find the  0th of july marked in her pocketbook as the day of her delivery and upon every occasion she gave the same account of it lady jane is allowed by all parties to have been a woman of sense it is not therefore credible that she would give lady stair alone a different account which numbers from her own information could contradict  answer   several persons of good character can depose that this witness is in a mistake besides i am assured that there are several persons of good character still alive who heard the countess of stair tell mrs primrose that she was in a mistake in supposing that this account was given her by lady jane for that it was told to the countess by some other person  a great clamor about the letters of pierre la mar as forgeries a great clamor has been raised about certain letters from pierre la mar which it is said were forged by sir john stewart  there was here no forgery as these letters were never used by sir john in evidence in the first place i deny that there was here properly speaking a forgery the essence of a forged deed consists in the using it in evidence whereas these letters never were so used by sir john stewart  the existence of such letters clearly proved it is proved that there really did exist such letters long before the time at which the plaintiffs allege that this forgery was committed as appears from the private pocketbook of lady jane douglas and from the oaths of several witnesses  internal evidence that the letters now charged as forgeries could not be so from a critical analysis of these letters it appears that though they contain some phrases of the purest french they are upon the whole full of anglicisms and miserably spelt so that it is impossible to suppose that sir john could ever have thought of palming them upon a court of justice as french letters  sir johns behavior before the court of session a confirmation that there was here no forgery several probable conjectures have been made both by counsel and judges with regard to these letters as may be seen in the law papers and speeches that sir john never intended a forgery must be evident to every impartial person because upon his examination before the court of session when he was asked with regard to these letters he looked at them in his careless manner and answered with that easy and unconcerned air which is the surest sign of conscious innocence  supposing the worst how far will this go but should we suppose the worst and allow that sir john did forge these letters how far will this go truth indeed does not require the aid of falsehood and it is very foolish nay very criminal to call in falsehood in support of truth yet many instances of this have occurred like the piae frauds which have been practiced in support of religion  if there were really a forgery it is well balanced by duruisseau at any rate the plaintiffs attack this circumstance with a very bad grace considering what their conduct has been for if this were a forgery it would surely be well balanced by the attempt made to forge the contents of michelles book by the false oath of duruisseau  a forgery could only show that sir johns anxiety made him take an improper step allowing the plaintiffs unworthy supposition to be true it can go no farther than to show that sir john stewarts anxiety to preserve his son made him take a very improper step  sir john and lady janes neglect of disproving the calumnies against them the last circumstance of conduct which has been vehemently urged in this cause is the neglect shown by sir john and lady jane of the reports which were raised of their having been guilty of imposing upon the world supposititious children and also their neglect of bringing undeniable evidence of the truth of the birth which it is said they might easily have done had the birth been real  these calumnies raised in the most shameful manner in answer to this let it be considered that these reports were raised in the most shameful and malicious manner  sir john and lady jane disdained these calumnies sir john stewart and lady jane douglas were highminded people and disdained such calumnies as they had a contempt for the authors of them  a striking proof of this a strong proof of this and which strikes one exceedingly is that in the private correspondence of sir john and lady jane which was never intended for the public view but has been most accidentally recovered they never once mention these injurious suspicions which shows how little they were really affected by them for upon truly generous minds undeserved calumnies will make no impression  lady jane went to douglas castle to ask what proof would be necessary besides lady jane had gone to douglas castle with intention to ask her brother the duke what proof would satisfy him that the children which she had with her were really hers but her relentless enemies surrounded the duke and prevented her having access to him  lady jane saw that it was in vsin to bring any proof this being the case to what purpose bring proofs as douglas castle was beset with dragons these proofs could have been of no service to her had she produced letters both from pierre la mar and madame le brun it would have been said that they were forged nay had pierre la mar and madame le brun themselves been brought to douglas castle to swear to the truth of the birth it would have been said that they were accomplices and perjuring themselves to support a falsehood for we have lived to see such accusations laid against people infinitely less suspicious  this demonstrated what then was lady jane to do people of undoubted credit and character had attested her pregnancy and mrs hewit was then alive and affirmed she was present at the delivery if they were not to be believed would obscure people be believed with regard to her delivery  lady jane consults the lord advocate for scotland but my lady jane did more she acted with the propriety of one of her high rank and took the advice of kings counsel she consulted my lord prestongrange then his majestys advocate for scotland in whose judgment and honor she had a perfect confidence assuring him that god knew her innocence and that the children were hers that she did not doubt but that the manmidwife was still alive and that if his lordship thought it necessary she would bring any proof that should be thought proper def pr p   0   his majestys advocate assures her that no proof was necessary his lordship with a spirit worthy of himself and of the person whom he was addressing answered her ladyship that she needed give herself no uneasiness about that matter for that as she and mr stewart acknowledged these children there was no further proof necessary for it behoved those who challenged the birth to prove that they were not her ladyships children ibid   the same advice given by a judge of the  of session the same advice was afterward given to the duchess of douglas by an honorable judge now deceased the late lord shewalton uncle to the present earl of glasgow purs pr p      sir john and lady jane had no occasion whatever to bring proofs we are not therefore to wonder that sir john and lady jane neglected to bring all the proof they might have done with regard to the birth of their children the only view they could have in doing so was to satisfy the duke of douglas which they had the mortification to see was impossible they had the opinion of counsel learned in the law that their children were already in possession of a proof sufficient to entitle them to all the privileges of british subjects and as they themselves knew the truth so all those whose good opinion they were anxious to preserve were firmly persuaded of their honor and of the legitimacy of their children  at any rate nothing more can possibly be inferred but that they had such an imprudence as is usual among mankind if after all it shall be thought that sir john and lady jane did not here act the most prudent part i answer that prudence was none of their virtues but i will go farther and say that prudence is a very bad test of the credibility of the actions of men if no conduct is believed but what is consistent with the rules of prudence the history of human life may be comprehended within very narrow bounds  the imprudence of human conduct exemplified in a wonderful manner i need not go far for an instance of this the tutors of the duke of hamilton and his brother are mostly persons of great respect as well as knowledge of business from such tutors one would expect very accurate proceedings and that they would do the very best and most prudent things for the interest of their pupils  duke hamiltons tutors begin this expensive process when it is probable his grace shall never get a shilling in return but what has been their conduct in this process why after the court of session had found that the duke of hamilton had no right to the estate of douglas but that it must descend to the heirs of line these tutors in place of appealing that judgment so as to have their pupils interest finally ascertained have been pleased to carry on a tedious lawsuit against mr douglas and have laid out immense sums of duke hamiltons money when in all probability his grace shall never get a shilling in return and his brother lord douglas shall be cut out of a chance which he had of succeeding to the douglas estate  duke hamiltons tutors authorize the tournelle process and monitoire these tutors also authorized the tournelle process and monitoire which of themselves might have been sufficient to destroy their cause before a british jury  therefore the conduct even of duke hamiltons tutors not the most prudent we may therefore surely be allowed to say that the conduct of these tutors has not been the most prudent this will be allowed to be an argumentum ad hominem to the plaintiffs  every unprejudiced person must be convinced that the plaintiffs have a very bad cause i flatter myself that every unprejudiced person is now convinced how very bad a cause these plaintiffs have been disguising with all the art that money can purchase  what the plaintiffs would have us believe let us shortly consider what they would have us believe  that lady jane douglas should all at once become totally abandoned it is this that the sister of the duke of douglas a lady of a distinguished good character who it is certain was then in the way of having children herself should all at once have become so abandoned as to enter into a plot to perpetrate the most villainous imposition upon the illustrious house from whence she sprung  that lady jane and her husband should buy a subject of the french king at the risk of dreadful punishments that having entered into this plot she and her husband went to paris and there run the risk of buying a subject of the french king when they knew to what dreadful punishments their doing so subjected them  that they should do this in the most dangerous manner when they go about this they take a recommendation from the chief magistrate of rheims to the inn at paris where all the people from rheims put up  that they should deliberately remain    months exposed to detection and all its dismal consequences instead of flying the kingdom after they had perpetrated so dangerous a crime they stay above a month in paris and the neighborhood and they return to rheims and remain there sixteen months during all which time they were liable to detection to a capital punishment to torture and to absolute infamy and disgrace  that they should give out that they had two children when they had only one they give it out that they had twins when one child was sufficient for their purpose and they give out that the youngest twin was a weakly delicate child though they had then only one child in their possession  that they should again run the same desperare risque and when they were in the greatest poverty should bring upon themselves the burden of two children the next year they go back again to paris they again run the same desperate risque and pick up a second child and when they were in such poverty that for many months they were obliged to burn and sell the lace off their clothes in order to procure themselves subsistence at this very time they chose to take the burden of no less than two children belonging to other people  that this second child picked up by chance should answer exactly to the description given    month before he was seen and that he should be the very picture of lady jane what was if possible still more wonderful this second weakly child which they picked up by mere chance answered exactly to the description which they had given of sholto then youngest son for sixteen months before and was the very picture of lady jane so that not a person who ever saw them together but was struck with their remarkable likeness as is proved by the oath of the right honorable mr stewart mkenzie lord privy seal for scotland purs pr p     as well as the oaths of many other respectable witnesses  such being the plaintiffs proof what can be the result of it such being the plaintiffs proof in the douglas cause i desire every impartial man in these kingdoms to say if he can consistently with reason not to mention charity take upon him to pronounce a sentence finding sir john stewart and lady jane douglas guilty of an infamous imposition and declaring archibald douglas esquire to be the son of a french glassgrinder  so strong is the cause of douglas even without his additional proof so strong is the cause of douglas when we have considered only his filiation as established by the acknowlegement of his parents and common fame opposed to those vague and inconclusive proofs which the plaintiffs with all their oppressive proceedings have been able to bring against him  part iv but mr douglas has brought a positive proof both direct and circumstantial but what shall we say if besides all this mr douglas can produce a chain of positive evidence amazingly strong at this distance of time he has done so though his parents did not make enquiries at paris he has and these enquiries have produced a proof both direct and circumstantial in his favor  the direct proof brought by mr douglas the direct proof is that of the actual birth and of what must have necessarily preceded and followed it viz the pregnancy and the reconvalescence of recovery  sir john stewart and mrs hewit swear to the actual delivery with regard to the actual delivery there are two witnesses who swear to it viz sir john stewart and mrs hewit  objection to sir john stewart it may be objected to sir john that his near connection to the defendant renders him a suspicious witness  answer to this it is answered that he is a witness called by the plaintiffs themselves and therefore they cannot now pretend to reject his evidence  objection to mrs hewit it may be objected to mrs hewit that she is also a suspicious witness as being an attendant or domestic of lady jane douglas  answer if this objection were to hold good the defendant and all who shall ever be in his situation must be deprived of almost the only witnesses who can be expected to be present at a fact of this kind  objection to both sir john and mrs hewit it may be objected to both sir john and mrs hewit that their evidence ought not to be received because they are accomplices in the crime charged in the present action  the answer to this of serious and universal importance to this it is answered that not only in law and equity but in the universal judgment of mankind innocence is always presumed nor are witnesses to be rejected as accomplices of a crime when proof is required to show that a crime has been committed if the objection were good against two witnesses it might be good against any number against whom a charge may be brought in the same manner as has been brought against sir john and mrs hewit so that law instead of being our guardian would sternly arm herself against her subjects and render it impossible for any birth ever to be proved but law is not so  therefore two positive witnesses to the actual delivery therefore to every impartial man in these kingdoms there are two positive witnesses to the actual delivery of lady jane douglas  lady janes pregnancy strongly proved the pregnancy of lady jane is proved by mrs hepburn of keith def pr p   mrs glass def pr p    purs pr p  0 and a variety of other witnesses who solemnly depose to circumstances all which together could not exist without a real pregnancy at least if they do ever so exist it is not above once in a million of times bountiful nature does not leave us in such a state of uncertainty with regard to what interests us so much  corroboration of the proof of lady janes pregnancy this proof of lady janes pregnancy becomes exceedingly strong when it is clearly proved that after the time at which she gave out that she was delivered she had all the appearances of a woman newly recovered from childbed  the positive proof of lady janes delivery confirmed by different appearances let us lay together the different appearances of lady jane before and after the period at which her delivery is said to have happened and then judge if any doubt can be entertained of her delivery  these appearances could not possibly be assumed it is material to observe that these appearances could not possibly be assumed by dress or by any other art because i am now to insist only upon such as must be allowed to have been the real appearances of her person  lady janes appearance before the time when she is said to have been delivered before the period at which she is said to have been delivered she appeared with very large breasts and a countenance such as she usually had when in health def pr p   ib p      lady janes appearance after the time she is said to have been delivered after the period at which she is said to have been delivered she appeared with very flat breasts and a countenance thin pale and languid purs pr p     ib p       these different appearances could not be without some intermediate illness now i desire to know of every person of experience and of every sensible physician if lady jane could possibly have had these different appearances without some intermediate illness  this intermediate illness childbirth if lady jane had an intermediate illness why shall we doubt that it was childbirth as solemnly deposed by two witnesses  the circumstantial proof brought by mr douglas the circumstantial proof in confirmation of the direct proof now stated is exceedingly strong unless we can suppose a number of witnesses having no knowledge or acquaintance one with another all combining different facts and circumstances so as to make one connected story  monfieur menagers circumstantial proof in the first place monsieur menager surgeon to a prince of the blood at paris who is proved by other witnesses to have been the most intimate acquaintance of pierre la mar deposes that la mar told him that he had delivered a foreign lady of an advanced age who came from rheims that it was her first birth that he had delivered her of twins and of male twins one of which was a sickly delicate child which on that account was left with la mar and was by him given out to nurse in the neighborhood of paris def pr p     et seq all these circumstances so directly correspond with the defendants story that it is impossible they can be true and his story false  the plaintiffs obliged to resort to their usual desperate argument that monsieur menager is perjured the plaintiffs therefore are obliged to have recourse to their usual desperate argument of representing monsieur menager as a man grossly perjured  monsieur menager accidentally discovered by those acting for the defendant that this matter may be fairly tried it must be considered that monsieur menager was accidentally discovered by those employed by the defendant it was from the prince of turenne himself that the information was received def pr p       monsieur menager is a man of good station and character monsieur menager is a man of good station and character so does not deserve to be suspected without good reason  the gentlemen employed for mr douglas are liable to no suspicion when monsieur menager was discovered the affairs of mr douglas were entirely in the hands of gentlemen sent from britain there were no french procureurs whose wicked proceedings we have seen and the behavior of the gentlemen sent from britain on the part of mr douglas has been such that they surely have not subjected themselves to any injurious imputation  monsieur menager a good witness therefore it follows that monsieur menager must by every impartial person be held as a good witness  objection to monsieur menager the only objection therefore to monsieur menagers evidence is that he is single  answer were it really so it were hard from thence to infer that he is perjured or that a single witness in a circumstantial proof is not to be believed  monsieur menager is supported by mr gilles but he is not a single witness for m gilles must be held as a concurring witness to the same facts for i hold him to the unsuspicious testimony that he gave in presence of monsieur moreau which he could have no temptation to give so that we have in reality two witnesses to these striking facts  monsieur menager is supported by other witnesses but monsieur menager is not supported by gilles alone for there are other witnesses who depose to a variety of circumstances all of which wonderfully concur in supporting the story of monsieur menager and of consequence supporting the story of the defendant  witnesses who support monsieur menager these other witnesses are a woman of the name of garnier a nurse in the neighborhood of paris the husband of this garnier and madame boucault her neighbor  deposition of nurse garnier in support of monsieur menager garnier def pr p     et seq has deposed that in summer      while she was living on the road to menilmontain she got from this very pierre la mar the friend of menager a weak delicate child who was a male twin and his brother also a male that he was a foreign child and was visited by foreign gentlemen one of whom expressed such a concern about him that she supposed he was the father and at last at the end of eighteen months or thereabouts this child was taken from her not to be given to another nurse at paris but to be carried further off in short the account given of this child agrees so exactly to sholto that it is impossible to suppose it could be any other  the plaintiffs here again reduced to their desperate expedient of an accusation of perjury therefore the plaintiffs are here again reduced to the desperate expedient of supposing this woman to be perjured and corrupted though like menager she was accidentally discovered by those acting for mr douglas never was tampered with by a danjou or any other french agent and in short was never in the hands of any body but the gentlemen sent from britain  confirmation of the evidence of menager and garnier by other unsuspicious witnesses but it will not answer the plaintiffs purpose to say that this poor woman is perjured they must further add to their black list her husband def pr p      and also her neighbor madame boucault def pr p     et seq  for she concurs with her in every particular and some things she has remembered more accurately than garnier for she has said that the child was kept only sixteen months which was just the precise time and she has described one of the stranger gentlemen that came to see the child in such a way that there is little reason to doubt but that it must have been sir john stewart  the wonderful strength of the defendants circumstantial evidence at this distance of time now the fact being thus established beyond all possibility of doubt that there was a weak twin foreign child given out to nurse near menilmontain by pierre la mar in the year      and that the story told by lady jane and sir john and the story told by monsieur menager exactly tally in this story it appears that there is here a chain of circumstantial evidence which no art or force of argument can break nay were that link of the chain which has been formed by menager or that link which is formed by garnier and the evidences concurring with her to be taken separately and compared with the story told by sir john and lady jane there would be in either case a proof wonderfully strong at this distance of time  it is impossible that so many circumstances should concur and the story of the defendant not be true is it possible to believe that all these circumstances should concur and yet that the story of the defendant should not be true  objection that m menagers la mar is not the same with sir johns la mar it has been objected by the plaintiffs that this pierre la mar cannot be the same person mentioned by sir john stewart in his declaration before the court of session because in several particulars he is proved to be very different from sir johns la mar  the alleged differences shown to be of small importance in answer to this it must be observed that the differences insisted on are in reality of little importance one of them is that sir johns accoucheur was called only pierre la mar whereas monsieur menagers friend was called louis pierre de la mar this is no more but that m la mar from an affectation of gentility very common in france chose to put de before his surname which however he usually dropped in familiar intercourse or in subscribing letters for his contract of marriage produced by the plaintiffs being a formal deed is no proof of the manner in which he signed his letters his being called louis as well as pierre must appear a very frivolous objection for we all know that people who have two names in this manner often sink one of them it has been said too that sir johns la mar was a walloon whereas menagers la mar is a frenchman but the answer is that menagers la mar was born at montreuil sur mer upon the borders of the walloon country and thence was readily taken for a walloon in short the only variation of any consequence is that sir john has said that he fell acquainted with la mar at so early a period that it could not be the friend of menager  sir john stewarts declaration heartily considered in answer to this let the candid and unprejudiced consider that sir john stewart was all his life long a man of vivacity and dissipation and was particularly remarkable for a strange incorrect memory as is proved by the oath of that worthy gentleman mr hepburn of keith who knew him intimately and who swears to most extraordinary instances of his forgetfulness when it cannot possibly be said that he had any design and therefore there is no wonder that a man of this singular frame of mind who had been abroad at several different times should be in a mistake in fancying a thing to have happened much earlier than it really did especially when it is considered that when sir john was obliged to make this judicial declaration he was very old being in his   th year and in such an infirm state of health that he was brought into court from his bed  evidence which speaks home to our hearts it remains to consider another kind of evidence in behalf of mr douglas and i am persuaded that this evidence will speak home to the hearts of the impartial people of these kingdoms  sir john and lady jane showed a constant affection and concern for their children sir john and lady jane during the whole course of their lives showed the greatest affection and concern for these children and this in no ostentatious manner for the most striking instances of it were accidentally observed  a very material question was put by a judge of the court of session to isabel walker one of lady janes maids did you ever observe sir john or lady jane repine at the expense of these children or betray any sign as if they were not their own oh no replied the witness with an air which convinced every unprejudiced person how much she spoke from the heart she added that they at all times showed an uniform fondness for their children even when they themselves were in the greatest poverty and distress  the affecting letters between sir john and lady jane an invincible proof to every humane mind but if we should even suppose them to be so consummately cool and artful as to persist for a series of years in the deepest dissimulation and that too before a maid who was constantly with them and saw them in their most unguarded moments what shall we say when we read these letters now accidentally recovered and never intended for the view of any other person these letters written while sir john was in prison and while lady jane was in straits and in sickness is it possible to suppose that these letters written in so noble a style of piety and expressing such warm sentiments of tenderness and love for their children is it possible to suppose that these letters were also dictated by dissimulation  the letters as strong as if sir john and lady jane had been overheard talking together in their most private moments i entreat my readers may peruse these moving letters and i know how their honest breasts will feel for much injured innocence in reading that correspondence it is just as if two alleged confederates in a crime were overheard talking together in the very next room and when we hear them breathing such strains of truth shall we not believe them nay it is as if we saw into the very bottom or their hearts and what do we find there but the sincerest parental affection  the dying declarations of sir john lady jane and mrs hewit lastly we have lady jane douglas sir john stewart and mrs hewit who have all three gone to death solemnly attesting the truth of the defendants birth  dying declarations are stronger than circumstantial poofs i do maintain that these dying declarations alone would be sufficient to counterbalance all the circumstantial proof which has been brought by the plaintiffs allowing it all to bear faith in judgment one witness upon the brink of eternity positively attesting a fact must to every humane mind be of more avail than many circumstances which seemingly tend to prove the contrary in the present case such circumstances are opposed by no less than three witnesses on the brink of eternity  conclusion warmly addressed to the impartial people of these kingdoms thus have i pleaded the cause of mr douglas to the best of my abilities i have examined the proof brought against him and i hope i have shown it to be totally inconclusive while i have also shown an amazing weight of evidence in his favor considering the distance of time providence indeed has preserved more proofs than could have been expected in order to defeat the designs of unjust revenge but i desire and call upon my readers to remember that this cause might be decided on conduct alone perjury and subornation of perjury must be considered as interwoven with every page of the plaintiffs french proofs otherwise i must boldly say that mr douglas has not a fair trial this alarming cause is now far advanced the feelings of indignation and of humanity are equally roused i leave then the douglas cause with the impartial people of these kingdoms  the end some observations on a pamphlet lately published entitled considerations on the douglas cause some observations etc upon seeing in the news papers of saturday last that considerations on the douglas cause were that day published and as i had read the proofs and memorials on that singularly important question i immediately sent for these considerations in order that i might see every thing which should be published upon a cause which has now for years engrossed the attention of almost every person in the united kingdom as well as in other countries in the beginning of these considerations we are told that they are composed by a person no lawyer and disconnected with both parties whose friends are pretty equally divided in their wishes that it is a question of fact and that he had often served on juries who are by the laws of scotland allowed to judge in matters of fact from this preamble i imagined that the observations of such a person would contain nothing in favor of either party but what was founded in the proof and that however far the keenness of parties might dispose them to carry their respective arguments an impartial unconnected juryman would consider facts in their true light divested of all art and false coloring but how great was my surprise when instead of this i found in the very next page an insinuation that of the seven judges who gave their opinions for the defender in scotland two had been his council and agents two appointed his guardians and a fifth had such connections with the defender as had induced him to decline judging in the preliminary steps of the cause the plain meaning of this insinuation is to convey an idea as if only two of these seven judges were to be considered as disconnected with the defender whereas on the other side only two of the judges which remained had the least connection with the pursuers by having been of their council the fact however is that three of these eight judges had been the pursuers council in the lawsuits betwixt duke hamilton and mr douglas and that some of them and several others are nearly connected with those who expect to be heirs of the duke of douglas failing the defender whereas none of the seven judges who gave their opinions for the defender have the most distant connection with him  in the next place this impartial juryman who by the bye is clearly some hireling employed by the pursuers and who has only assumed the title of a disconnected person that his considerations may have the greater appearance of impartiality goes on to inform that he begun the examination of the proofs and memorials with diffidence that he believed it an intricate cause from the division among the judges and that he was careful lest he should go wrong as seven or perhaps eight of the judges in scotland had done but that great was his astonishment on finding the cause perfectly clear against the defender he then goes on to give his reasons for being of this opinion some of the most material of which i shall shortly touch upon and show that they are clearly false and no other than an abridgement of the artificial arguments contained in the plaintiffs memorial  the first is that lady jane before leaving aix la chapelle in a letter to mr haldene gave a false account of her destination which was prudent if a fraud was intended because otherwise she might have been watched that she declined staying at liege and left rheims upon the false pretense of want of proper assistance  it is not true that ever lady jane concealed or gave a false account of her destination on leaving aix  for some time it is perfectly clear she intended to have gone to geneva and there after changed her mind when she did so she made no secret of the place of her destination told the whole circle of her acquaintance at aix that she was going to rheims pressed lady wigton come and live with her there and caused to write to a person to take a house for her she mentioned it to her whole acquaintances at liege at which place she could not possibly stay as it is the most disagreeable place in germany and she had by this time given orders to take a house for her at rheims immediately on her arrival at rheims she wrote to every person with whom she had occasion to correspond and even invited lord crawford to come and visit them there that after she had staid some time at rheims she was advised to go to paris on account of the unskilfulness of accoucheurs at rheims is also clearly in proof and not the vestige of evidence to the contrary so that this very suspicious circumstance is false from beginning to end  this juryman next says that so far were they on leaving rheims from acquainting mr mailfer of the motives of their journey to paris that they tell him that the object of their journey was to make purchases  it is very extraordinary that a person should tell an absolute untruth in an affair of this serious nature sir john never told mr mailfer that his business to paris was to make purchases nor does mr mailfer say so in any part of the letter to godfrey and if mailfer had said it which he does not it would have been absurd from hence to have argued that the motive of the journey was concealed as it is clearly in proof that it was known to the whole town of rheims  again it is said that lady jane avoided giving any detail of what past in paris and never was heard to mention any particular relative to the birth of her sons only that on being pressed by lady stair she said she had been delivered within two or three hours of her arrival at paris  but that the scrutiny which has been since made obliges the defender to give up this account of lady janes  this again is absolutely false and contrary to clear evidence lady jane did in her own life time mention all the circumstances of her delivery the time when the person in whose house and the accoucheur by whom the evidence of lady janes having said she was delivered within two or three hours of her arrival in paris is of a very singular nature the hearsay of a hearsay from lady stair then almost  0 years of age and remarkably deaf sworn to by her daughter mrs primrose at the distance of many years and who at the time of giving her oath is above  0 years of age this very witness too has from want of memory sworn sundry things which are not true and clearly disproved consequently this part of her oath is not very much to be depended upon and is also contradicted by positive testimony it is an absolute untruth that the defender is forced out of this account given by lady jane by the scrutiny since made at the defenders service when no scrutiny had been made the time the place and every circumstance of the birth was mentioned in the same manner as at present if mrs hewit had said at the service that lady jane had been brought to bed in three hours after her arrival at paris and it had now been insisted it was six days after what this impartial scotch juryman says would have been true but as it is otherwise it is an absolute falsehood  he next says sir johns examination was taken in presence of the lords with great deliberation and lasted three days and yet that the defender wants to reject it as false in every article and to substitute another la mar in place of sir johns la mar with the aid of one mr menager who deposes to a delivery performed by la mar but which cannot be that of lady jane as it happened in the year       this is as unfair as any of his former observations the defender never has so far as i can observe from his memorial rejected any one part of sir johns declaration as false he has owned that from his great age then    years and sickly state having been raised out of bed to attend the court of session he had fallen into some inconsiderable mistakes in answering questions as to facts which happened sixteen years before i see it is asserted and not denied that he behaved on that occasion with uncommon ease and unconcern which would have been impossible if he had been guilty of the crime this juryman supposes and so far as i can observe from the printed speeches of the judges none of them have insinuated that he did not behave on that occasion in the most proper manner as to the delivery mentioned by mr menager having happened in the year      this is clearly not true as there is the most undeniable evidence of its having happened subsequent to la marres marriage which was in the      and in summer      when he gave out sholto to be nursed upon the milk of a woman near paris whose child was born in march       it is next said that the only time sir john mentioned real persons was in a note to mrs napier in the year      when he mentioned michelles as the place of delivery imagining that that family would by that time at the distance of   years have been dead but finding that they had been found out he shifted the scene and placed it in the house of the ideal madame le brun who was then mentioned for the first time  this too is as untrue as any of his former observations sir john mentioned one landlady in place of another by mere unintended mistake la bruns had been mentioned in lady janes life time as the place of her delivery so that it was not on the michelle family being found out and denying that the delivery happened in their house that she was first mentioned and the result of the enquiries by principal gordon never was communicated to sir john consequently he could not vary the place on being informed of that enquiry  he next says that if a scotch lady of quality had been really delivered of twins in the house of le brun and by a la mar their whole friends acquaintances and neighbors would have heard of it and that every person in whose house they ever lodged abroad remember them and that every other person except la mar and le brun these precious people as they are called have been found  to this it is in the first place to be noticed that the only title lady jane took either at paris or at rheims was that of madame stewart and that the wife of the meanest person in france is called madame such as the noted madame mignion madame sanry etc who are common beggars so that her being a lady of quality was not so much as known and the delivery of a lady of twins was surely no extraordinary affair and it is not true that every person with whom they lodged except le brun has been found the landladies at sedan are not found out the person in whose house they lived after leaving godefrois and before entering to michelles has not been found out and the nurse brought to michelles as well as sir johns servant quibil one of godefrois servants and several persons of this very name of le brun who at that time had houses in paris are not found out all of whom are admitted to have existed and there is the clearest evidence possible of la mars existence and of his death of his having brought lady jane to bed and told it to sundry of his acquaintances  the juryman then says that they arrived at godefrois on the  th where they are proved by his books and oath to have remained till the   th he does not say where they were from the   th to the   th when he says they arrived at michelles that therefore lady jane could not have been delivered on the  0th of july in le bruns and mrs hewit has been guilty of wilful perjury in saying lady jane remained in childbed nine days and this being the case what credit says he can be given to any thing she or sir john can say  i have considered the evidence of this man godefroi and of his books with as much attention and with much less partiality than this juryman and i confess i never saw such a burlesque upon evidence an innkeeper swearing at the distance of eighteen years to the particular days of the week and month when a person or company entered to his house what rooms they occupied and how many days they staid is such a memory as never was heard of before there are no such persons as lady jane and sir john in his whole books in july      so that the books can never be of the least avail there are indeed some arguments in the pursuers memorial to show that a blank account in this mans book must apply to sir john but this appears to me absolutely chimerical so it is unnecessary and indeed i have not time to answer them  it is not true nor indeed is there the shadow of evidence that they arrived at michelles on the   th or sooner than the   th at night or  0th july but as the pursuers in their memorial have said so this impartial disinterested and judicious juryman takes it for granted though contrary to the clearest evidence if he had taken the trouble to look at it  he next goes on to mention the enlevement of a child from one mignion and says that when he was given away his mother insisted upon leaving her own swadlingcloaths of a coarse kind of blanket and this coarse blanket was found on the defender when he was given to favre so that he must be mignions child  it is amazing what lengths party or interest will carry a person to in questions which deserve the most unbiassed consideration madame mignion perjured as she is admitted to be in favor of the pursuers does not even say that the bit of dress left with her child was of blanket and as little does favre say that what she describes as molton or blanketing was a bit inferior to the other parts of the defenders dress there never were two children seen whose descriptions agree less with each other than that of mignions child and the defender in dress color strength eyes and every thing else  from page    to page    this juryman accuses lady jane of falsehood of flattery of duplicity and i know not what for no other reason than that she in one of her letters commends two young gentlemen she met with at the hague  that she is in a passion with one of her relations for saying she is living at windsor under a borrowed name with col stewart and that she denied her marriage to lady catharine wemyss at a time she was keeping it a secret from all the world  if a person of her high rank and remarkable good character for religion good sense and other amiable accomplishments is to be abused in the manner this hireling for he can be nothing else has done lady jane for such reasons as these it is certain no woman on earth can possibly escape falling a sacrifice to the spite of such illiberal badhearted people it is very true that if she was now alive she would probably think differently of some of those young gentlemen of whom she had then so good an opinion from her own letter she had much reason to be dissatisfied at the person she is angry with for many falsehoods she had raised to her prejudice and her denying her marriage does not in her circumstances appear to me at all culpable if people are to judge of ones character from their writings the author of these considerations if he is as disinterested in this suit as he pretends is surely a very bad hearted man for at the very time he is employed in writing these considerations he must have been sensible he was saying many things which are absolutely false with an intention to prejudice the world against a young man who never offended him  he next says that sholto was left sixteen months at paris under the care of la mar and that if he had died in the mean time no person knew where the child was so he must have been lost  sir john knew well at the time where the child was at nurse he had seen him frequently when at paris he had visited him from damartine he had wrote to lady jane an account of his health from paris to that place as appears from mrs hewits letter to the maids he returned to paris in october      and carried clothes with him for the child he went back again in the spring      for no other purpose but to see the child how then can this man say that if la mar had died the child would have been lost the only reason he has is that sir john says when examined in the year      in the   th year of his age that he did not then remember the place where she had lived in the year       the juryman then goes on to state that when sir john and lady jane were about to return to britain they went from rheims to paris under the pretense of bringing away their second child that during the eight days they were then at paris a child of one sanry was carried off from his father by one duverne who was aged about sixty and that this duverne was no other than sir john stewart and the child sholto  as to this charge without entering much into the particulars it is as clear as sunshine that the child of sanry and sholto were different the proof of the existence of sholto from his birth in july      is to me convincing sanrys child was four months older than the defender yet sholto was much less and weaker than his brother as had been uniformly given out sanrys child was walking and speaking when carried off and yet the evidence is clear that sholto did neither when brought to england and for some time after and every one of the pursuers witnesses say that application was made to the lieutenant of police to make a search for the persons who carried off this child within two or three days after he was taken away from his parents and there is the most satisfying evidence that this magistrate was not applied to till the  0th of january    0 several weeks before which time sir john had left rheims on his return to england with both his children so that he could not possibly have had the least connection with this pretended enlevement  his arguments upon the supposed impossibility of their not writing to paris when they heard of the suspicions as to the legitimacy of their children their writing to aix for certificates of the pregnancy etc are not worth minding they are trivial and totally immaterial only it is very clearly proved that they took the advice of a gentleman very eminent in his profession then a lawyer if they ought to do so and were assured it was highly unnecessary and improper and had they upon false reports raised in the manner these have been proved to have been given themselves the trouble of obtaining certificates they would rather have increased than diminished the suspicions  what he has said as to godefroi is already noticed and it is needless to take more time upon it at present  his observations upon lady janes pregnancy are puerile and trifling to the highest degree if ever woman on earth was with child during the whole nine months prior to the birth lady jane douglas was her appearance of pregnancy was not sudden as alleged by this author but gradual observed by her servants and the people about her from the first hour and continued gradually increasing till she was delivered of the defender and his twin brother the supposal of her appearance of pregnancy being stronger at aix than at rheims is ridiculous when it is supposed she was at this very time deceiving one of her own maid servants who was about her at both these places  this author concludes with an idle and unnecessary account of the popularity of the defender and his cause in scotland that the whole country were incensed at the judgment but that the judicious and most valuable part of society though perhaps the least numerous applauded the decision  the purpose of this declamation i do not see nor did i ever hear who the valuable part of society alluded to are unless they be the tutors of duke hamilton  the heirs of line of the duke of douglas and their friends and some of the authors of the scandalous reports which were falsely raised against lady jane  this gentleman however is pleased to say that every humane heart must compassionate the defender and that he applauds his patroness by whom i suppose he means the duchess of douglas for her unwearied support of him  whether this gentleman is one of these humane hearted people will appear from his pamphlet the defender i am persuaded despises his pity as much as his pamphlet and as much as the duchess of douglas if i am not much mistaken of her character does his praises she has done what she thought her duty and what she owed to the family of douglas
