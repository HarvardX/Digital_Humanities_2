reasonable kind  spring come gentle spring ethereal mildness come and from the bosom of yon dropping cloud while music wakes around veiled in a shower of shadowing roses on our plains descend o hertford fitted or to shine in courts with unaffected grace or walk the plain with innocence and meditation joined in soft assemblage listen to my song that thy own season paints when nature all is blooming and benevolent like thee and see where surly winter passes off far to the north and calls his ruffian blasts his blasts obey and quit the howling hill the shattered forest and the ravaged vale while softer gales succeed at whose kind touch dissolving snows in livid torrents lost the mountains lift their green heads to the sky as yet the trembling year is unconfirmd and winter often at eve resumes the breeze chills the pale morn and bids his driving sleets deform the day delightless so that scarce the bittern knows the time with bill ingulpht to shake the sounding marsh or from the shore the plovers theirs to scatter over the heath and sing their wild notes to the listening waste at last from aries rolls the bounteous sun and the bright bull receives him then no more the expansive atmosphere is cramped with cold but full of life and vivifying soul lifts the light clouds sublime and spreads them thin fleecy and white over allsurrounding heaven forth fly the tepid airs and unconfined unbinding earth the moving softness strays joyous the impatient husbandman perceives relenting nature and his lusty steers drives from their stalls to where the wellusd plow lies in the furrow loosened from the frost there unrefusing to the harnessed yoke they lend their shoulder and begin their toil cheered by the simple song and soaring lark meanwhile incumbent over the shining share the master leans removes the obstructing clay winds the whole work and sidelong lays the glebe white through the neighboring fields the sower stalks with measured step and liberal throws the grain into the faithful bosom of the ground the harrow follows harsh and shuts the scene be gracious heaven for now laborious man has done his due ye fostering breezes blow ye softening dews ye tender showers descend and temper all thou worldreviving sun into the perfect year nor ye who live in luxury and ease in pomp and pride think these lost themes unworthy of your ear twas such as these the rural maro sung to the full roman court in all its height of elegance and taste the sacred plow employed the kings and fathers of mankind in ancient times and some with whom compared youre but the beings of a summers day have held the scale of justice shook the lance of mighty war then with descending hand unused to little delicacies seized the plow and greatly independent lived ye generous britons cultivate the plow and over your hills and long withdrawing vales let autumn spread his treasures to the sun luxuriant and unbounded as the sea far through his azure turbulent extent your empire owns and from a thousand shores wafts all the pomp of life into your ports so with superior boon may your rich soil exuberant natures better blessings pour over every land the naked nations cloth and be the exhaustless granary of a world nor through the lenient air alone this change delicious breathes the penetrative sun his force deep darting to the dark retreat of vegetation sets the steaming power at large to wander over the verdant earth in various hues but chiefly thee gay green thou smiling natures universal robe united light and shade where the sight dwells with growing strength and evernew delight from the moist meadow to the brownbrowd hill led by the breeze the vivid verdure runs and swells and deepens to the cherished eye the hawthorn whitens and the juicy groves put forth their buds unfolding by degrees till the whole leafy forest stands displayed in full luxuriance to the sighing gales while the deer rustle through the twining brake and the birds sing concealed at once arrayed in all the colors of the flushing year by natures swift and secretworking hand the garden glows and fills the liberal air with lavish fragrance while the promised fruit lies yet a little embryo unperceived within its crimson folds now from the town buried in smoke and sleep and noisome damps often let me wander over the dewy fields where freshness breathes and dash the lucid drops from the bent bush as through the fuming maze of sweetbriar hedges i pursue my walk or taste the smell of dairy or ascend some eminence augusta in thy plains and see the country far diffused around one boundless blush one white empurpled shower of mingled blossoms where the raptured eye travels from joy to joy and hid beneath the fair profusion yellow autumn spies if brushed from russian wilds a cutting gale rise not and scatter from his foggy wings the bitter mildew or dryblowing breathe untimely frost before whose baleful blast the fullblown spring through all her foliage shrinks into a smutty widedejected waste for often engendered by the hazy north myriads on myriads insect armies waft keen in the poisoned breeze and wasteful eat through buds and bark into the blackened core their eager way a feeble race scarce seen save by the prying eye yet famine waits on their corrosive course and kills the year sometimes over cities as they steer their flight where rising vapor melts their wings away gazed by the astonished crowd the horrid shower descends and hence the skilful farmer chaff and blazing straw before his orchard burns till all involved in smoke the latent foe from every cranny suffocated falls or onions steaming hot beneath his trees exposes fatal to the frosty tribe nor from their friendly task the busy bill of little trooping birds instinctive scares these are not idle philosophic dreams full nature swarms with life the unfaithful fen in putrid steams emits the livid cloud of pestilence through subterranean cells where searching sunbeams never found a way earth animated heaves the flowery leaf wants not its soft inhabitants the stone hard as it is in every winding pore holds multitudes but chief the forestboughs which dance unnumberd to the inspiring breeze the downy orchard and the melting pulp of mellow fruit the nameless nations feed of evanescent insects where the pool stands mantled over with green invisible amid the floating verdure millions stray each liquid too whether of acid taste potent or mild with various forms abounds nor is the lucid stream nor the pure air though one transparent vacancy they seem devoid of theirs even animals subsist on animals in infinite descent and all so fine adjusted that the loss of the least species would disturb the whole stranger than this the inspective glass confirms and to the curious gives the amazing scenes of lessening life by wisdom kindly hid from eye and ear of man for if at once the worlds in worlds enclosed were pushed to light seen by his sharpened eye and by his ear intensely bended heard from the choice cate the freshest viands and the brightest wines he would turn abhorrent and in dead of night when silence sleeps over all be stunned with noise the northeast spends his rage and now shut up within his iron caves the effusive south warms the wide air and over the void of heaven breaths the big clouds with vernal showers distent at first a dusky wreath they seem to rise scarce staining ether but by fast degrees in heaps on heaps the doubling vapor sails along the loaded sky and mingling thick sits on the horizon round a settled gloom not such as wintry storms on mortals shed oppressing life but lovely gentle kind and full of every hope and every joy the wish of nature gradual sinks the breeze into a perfect calm that not a breath is heard to quiver through the closing woods or rustling turn the manytwinkling leaves of aspin tall the uncurling floods diffused in glassy breadth seem through delusive lapse forgetful of their course it is silence all and pleasing expectation herds and flocks drop the dry sprig and muteimploring eye the falling verdure hushed in short suspense the plumy people streak their wings with oil and wait the approaching sign to strike at once into the general choir even mountains vales and forests seem expansive to demand the promised sweetness man superior walks amid the glad creation musing praise and looking lively gratitude at last the clouds consign their treasures to the fields and softly shaking on the dimply pool prelusive drops let all their moisture flow in large effusion over the freshend world it is scarce to patter heard the stealing shower by such as wander through the forestwalks beneath the umbrageous multitude of leaves but who can hold the shade while heaven descends in universal bounty shedding herbs and fruits and flowers on natures ample lap imagination fired prevents their growth and while the verdant nutriment distills beholds the kindling country color round thus all day long the fulldistended clouds indulge their genial stores and wellshowerd earth is deep enriched with vegetable life till in the westernsky the downward sun looks out illustrious from amidst the flush of broken clouds gayshifting to his beam the rapid radiance instantaneous strikes the illumined mountain through the forest streams shakes on the floods and in a yellow mist far smoking over the interminable plain in twinkling myriads lights the dewy gems moist bright and green the landscape laughs around full swell the woods their every music wakes mixed in wild consort with the warbling brooks increased thunnumberd bleatings of the hills the hollow lows responsive from the vales whence blending all the sweetened zephyr springs mean time refracted from yon eastern cloud bestriding earth the grand ethereal bow shoots up immense and every hue unfolds in fair proportion running from the red to where the violet fades into the sky here mighty newton the dissolving clouds are as they scatter round thy numerous prism untwisting to the philosophic eye the various twine of light by thee pursued through the white mingling maze not so the swain he wondering views the bright enchantment bend delightful over the radiant fields and runs to catch the falling glory but amazed beholds the amusive arch before him fly then vanish quite away still night succeeds a softened shade and saturated earth awaits the morning beam to give again transmuted soon by natures chemistry the blooming blessings of the former day then spring the living herbs profusely wild over all the deepgreen earth beyond the power of botanist to number up their tribes whether he steals along the lonely dale in silent search or through the forest rank with what the dull incurious weeds account bursts his blind way or climbs the mountain rock fired by the nodding verdure of its brow with such a liberal hand has nature flung their seeds abroad blown them about in winds innumerous mixed them with the nursing mold the moistening current and prolific rain but who their virtues can declare who pierce with vision pure into these secret stores of life and health and joy the food of man while yet he lived in innocence and told a length of golden years unfleshd in blood a stranger to the savage arts of life death rapine carnage surfeit and disease the lord and not the tyrant of the world then the glad morning waked the gladdend race of uncorrupted men nor blushed to see the sluggard sleep beneath her sacred beam for their light slumbers gently fumed away and up they rose as vigorous as the sun or to the culture of the willing glebe or to the cheerful tendance of the flock mean time the song went round and dance and sport wisdom and friendly talk successive stole their hours away while in the rosy vale love breathed his infant sighs from anguish free replete with bliss and only wept for joy nor yet injurious act nor surly deed was known among these happy sons of heaven for reason and benevolence were law harmonious nature too looked smiling on clean shone the skies cooled with eternal gales and balmy spirit all the youthful sun shot his best rays and still the gracious clouds dropped fatness down as over the swelling mead the herds and flocks commixing played secure which when emergent from the gloomy wood the glaring lion saw his horrid heart was meekend and he joined his sullen joy for music held the whole in perfect peace soft sighed the flute the tender voice was heard warbling the joyous heart the woodlands round applied their quire and winds and waters flowed in consonance such were these prime of days this to the poets gave the golden age when as they sung in elevated phrase the sailorpine had not the nations yet in commerce mixed for every country teemed with every thing spontaneous harvests waved still in a sea of yellow plenty round the forest was the vineyard where untaught to climb unprund and wild the juicy grape burst into floods of wine the knotted oak shook from his boughs the long transparent streams of honey creeping through the matted grass the uncultivated thorn a ruddy shower of fruitage shed on such as sat below in blooming ease and from brown labor free save what the copious gathering grateful gave the rivers foamed with nectar or diffuse silent and soft the milky maze devolved nor had the spongy fullexpanded fleece yet drunk the tyrian dye the stately ram shone through the mead in native purple clad or milder saffron and the dancing lamb the vivid crimson to the sun disclosed nothing had power to hurt the savage soul yet untransfusd into the tygers heart burned not his bowels nor his gamesome paw drove on the fleecy partners of his play while from the flowery brake the serpent rolled his fairer spires and played his pointless tongue but now whatever these gaudy fables meant and the white minutes which they shadowed out are found no more amid those iron times those dregs of life in which the human mind has lost that harmony ineffable which warms the soul of happiness and all is off the poise within the passions all have burst their bounds and reason half extinct or impotent or else approving sees the foul disorder anger storms at large without an equal cause and fell revenge supports the falling rage close envy bites with venomed tooth while weak unmanly fear full of frail fancies loosens every power even love itself is bitterness of soul a pleasing anguish pining at the heart hope sickens with extravagance and grief of life impatient into madness swells or in dead silence wastes the weeping hours these and a thousand mixed emotions more from everchanging views of good and ill formed infinitely various vex the mind with endless storm whence inlyrankling grows the selfish thought a listless inconcern cold and averting from our neighbors good then dark disgust and malice winding wiles sneaking deceit and coward villainy at last deeprooted hatred lewd reproach convulsive wrath and thoughtless fury quick to deeds of vilest aim even natures self is deemed vindictive to have changed her course hence in old time they say a deluge came when the disparting orb of earth that arched the imprisoned deep around impetuous rushed with ruin inconceivable at once into the gulf and over the highest hills widedashd the waves in undulation vast till from the center to the streaming clouds a shoreless ocean tumbled round the globe the seasons since as hoar tradition tells have kept their constant chase the winter keen poured out his waste of snows and summer shot his pestilential heats great spring before greend all the year and fruits and blossoms blushed in social sweetness on the selfsame bough clear was the temperate air an even calm perpetual reigned save what the zephyrs bland breathed over the blue expanse for then nor storms were taught to blow nor hurricanes to rage sound slept the waters no sulphurous glooms swelled in the sky and sent the lightning forth while sickly damps and cold autumnal fogs sat not pernicious on the springs of life but now from clear to cloudy moist to dry and hot to cold in restless change revolved our drooping days are dwindled down to naught the fleeting shadow of a winters sun and yet the wholesome herb neglected dies in lone obscurity unprizd for food although the pure exhilerating soul of nutriment and health salubrious breathes by heaven infused along its secret tubes for with hot ravine fired ensanguind man is now become the lion of the plain and worse the wolf who from the nightly fold fiercedrags the bleating prey never drunk her milk nor wore her warming fleece nor has the steer at whose strong chest the deadly tiger hangs ever plowed for him they too are tempered high with hunger stung and wild necessity nor lodges pity in their shaggy breasts but man whom nature formed of milder clay with every kind emotion in his heart and taught alone to weep while from her lap she pours ten thousand delicacies herbs and fruits as numerous as the drops of rain and beams that gave them birth shall he fair form who wears sweet smiles and looks erect on heaven ever stoop to mingle with the prowling herd and dip his tongue in blood the beast of prey it is true deserves the fate in which he deals him from the thicket let the hardy youth provoke and foaming through the awakened woods with every nerve pursue but you ye flocks what have ye done ye peaceful people what to merit death you who have given us milk in luscious streams and lent us your own coat against the winters cold whose usefulness in living only lies and the plain ox that harmless honest guileless animal in what has he offended he whose toil patient and everready clothes the land with all the pomp of harvest shall he bleed and wrestling groan beneath the cruel hands even of the clowns he feeds and that perhaps to swell the riot of the gathering feast won by his labor thus the feeling heart would tenderly suggest but it is enough in this late age adventurous to have touched light on the numbers of the samian sage high heaven beside forbids the daring strain whose wisest will has fixed us in a state that must not yet to pure perfection rise but yonder breathing prospect bids the muse throw all her beauty forth that daubing all will be to what i gaze for who can paint like nature can imagination boast amid his gay creation hues like hers and can he mix them with that matchless skill and lay them on so delicately fine and lose them in each other as appears in every bud that blows if fancy then unequal fails beneath the lovely task ah what shall language do ah where find words tinged with so many colors and whose power to life approaching may perfume my lays with that fine oil these aromatic gales which inexhaustive flow continual round yet though successless will the toil delight come then ye virgins and ye youths whose hearts have felt the raptures of refining love oh come and while the rosyfooted may steals blushing on together let us walk the morning dews and gather in their prime freshblooming flowers to deck the braided hair and the white bosom that improves their sweets see where the winding vale her lavish stores irriguous spreads see how the lilly drinks the latent rill scarce oozing through the grass of growth luxuriant or the humid bank profusely climbs turgent in every pore the gummy moisture shines new luster lends and feeds the spirit that diffusive round refreshes ail the dale long let us walk where the breeze blows from yon extended field of blossomed beans arabia cannot boast a fuller gale of joy than liberal thence breathes through the sense and takes the ravished soul nor is the meadow worthless of our foot full of fresh verdure and unnumberd flowers the negligence of nature wide and wild where undisguisd by mimic art she spreads unbounded beauty to the boundless eye it is here that their delicious task the bees in swarming millions tend around athwart this way and that the busy nations fly cling to the bud and with inserted tube its soul its sweetness and its manna suck the little chemist thus allmoving heaven has taught and often of bolder wing he dares the purple heath or where the wildthyme grows and yellow loads him with the luscious spoil at length the finished garden to the view its vistas opens and its alleys green snatched through the verdant maze the hurried eye distracted wanders now the bowery walk of covert close where scarce a speck of day falls on the lengthened gloom protracted darts now meets the bending sky the river now dimpling along the breezyruffled lake the forest running round the rising spire the ethereal mountain and the distant main but why so far excursive when at hand along the blushing borders dewybright and in yon mingled wilderness of flowers fairhanded spring unbosoms every grace throws out the snowdrop and the crocus first the daily primrose violet darkly blue dewbending cowslips and of nameless dies anemonies auriculas a tribe peculiar powdered with a shining sand renunculas and iris manyhued then comes the tuliprace where beauty plays her gayest freaks from family diffused to family as flies the fatherdust the varied colors run and while they break on the charmed florists eye he curious stands and newflushd glories all ecstatic marks nor hyacinths are wanting nor junquils of potent fragrance nor narcissus white nor striped carnations nor enameled pinks  owerd from every bush the damaskrose infinite numbers delicacies smells with hues on hues expression cannot paint the breath of nature and her endless bloom hail mighty being universal soul of heaven and earth essential presence hail to thee i bend the knee to thee my thoughts continual climb who with a masterhand have the great whole into perfection touched by thee the various vegetative tribes wrapped in a filmy net and clad with leaves draw the live ether and imbibe the dew by thee disposed into congenial soils stands each attractive plant and sucks and swells the juicy tide a twining mass of tubes at thy command the vernal sun awakes the torpid sap detruded to the root by wintry winds that now in fluent dance and lively fermentation mounting spreads all this innumerouscolourd scene of things ascending from the vegetable world to higher life with equal wing ascend my panting muse and hark how loud the woods invite you forth in all your gayest trim lend me your song ye nightingales oh pour the mazyrunning soul of melody into my varied verse while i deduce from the first note the hollow cuckoo sings the symphony of spring and touch a theme unknown to fame the passion of the groves just as the spirit of love is sent abroad warm through the vital air and on their hearts harmonious seizes the gay troops begin in gallant thought to plume the painted wing and try again the longforgotten strain at first faintwarbled but no sooner grows the soft infusion prevalent and wide than all alive at once their joy overflows in music unconfined upsprings the lark shrillvoiced and loud the messenger of morn ever yet the shadows fly he mounted sings amid the dawning clouds and from their haunts calls up the tuneful nations every copse thickwove and tree irregular and bush bending with dewy moisture over the heads of the coy quiristers that lodge within are prodigal of harmony the thrush and woodlark over the kindcontending throng superior heard run through the sweetest length of notes when listening philomela deigns to let them joy and purposes in thought elate to make her night excel their day the blackbird whistles from the thorny brake the mellow bullfinch answers from the grove nor are the linnets over the flowering furze poured out profusely silent joined to these thousands beside thick as the covering leaves they warble under or the nitid hues that speck them over their modulations mix mellifluous the jay the rook the daw and each harsh pipe discordant heard alone here aid the consort while the stockdove breathes a melancholy murmur through the whole it is love creates their gaiety and all this waste of music is the voice of love which even to birds and beasts the tender arts of pleasing teaches hence the glossy kind try every winning way inventive love can dictate and in fluttering courtship pour their little souls before her wide around respectful first in airy rings they rove endeavoring by a thousand tricks to catch the cunning conscious halfaverted glance of their regardless charmer should she seem softening the least approvance to bestow their colors burnish and by hope inspired they brisk advance then on a sudden struck retire disordered then again approach and throwing out the last efforts of love in fond rotation spread the spotted wing and shiver every feather with desire connubial leagues agreed to the deep woods they haste away each as their fancy leads pleasure or food or secret safety prompts that natures great command may be obeyed nor all the sweet sensations they perceive indulged in vain some to the hollyhedge nestling repair and to the thicket some some to the rude protection of the thorn resolve to trust their young the clested tree offers its kind concealment to a few their food its insects and its moss their nests others apart far in the grassy dale their humble texture weave but most delight in unfrequented glooms or shaggy banks steep and divided by a babbling brook whose murmurs sooth them all the livelong day when for a season fixed among the roots of hazel pendant over the plaintive stream they frame the first foundation of their domes dry sprigs of trees in artful manner laid and bound with clay together now it is naught but hurry hurry through the busy air beat by unnumberd wings the swallow sweeps the slimy pool to build his hanging house ingeniously intent often from the back of herds and flocks a thousand tugging bills pluck hair and wool and often when unobserved steal from the barn the straw till soft and warm clean and complete their habitation grows as thus the patient dam assiduous sits not to be tempted from her tender task or by sharp hunger or by smooth delight though the whole loosened spring around her blows her sympathizing lover takes his stand high on thopponent bank and ceaseless sings the tedious time away or else supplies her place a moment while she sudden flits to pick the scanty meal the appointed time with pious toil fulfilled the callow young warmed and expanded into perfect life their brittle bondage break and come to light a helpless family demanding food with constant clamor oh what passions then what melting sentiments of kindly care seize the new parents hearts away they fly affectionate and undesiring bear the most delicious morsel to their young which equally distributed again the search begins so pitiful and poor a gentle pair on providential heaven cast as they weeping eye their clamant train check their own appetites and give them all nor is the courage of the fearful kind nor is their cunning less should some rude foot their woody haunts molest stealthy aside into the center of a neighboring bush they drop and whirring thence alarmed deceive the rambling schoolboy hence around the head of traveller the whitewingd plover wheels her sounding flight and then directly on in long excursion skims the level lawn to tempt you from her nest the wildduck hence over the rough moss and over the trackless waste the heathhen flutters as if hurt to lead the hot pursuing spaniel far astray be not the muse ashamed here to bemoan her brothers of the grove by tyrant man inhuman caught and in the narrow cage from liberty confined and boundless air dull are the pretty slaves their plumage dull ragged and all its brightning luster lost nor is that luscious wildness in their notes that warbles from the beech oh then desist ye friends of harmony this barbarous art forbear if innocence and music can win on your hearts or piety persuade but let not chief the nightingale lament her ruined care too delicately framed to brook the harsh confinement of the cage often when returning with her loaded bill the astonished mother finds a vacant nest by the hard hand of unrelenting clowns robbed to the ground the vain provision falls her pinions ruffle and lowdrooping scarce can bear the mourner to the poplar shade where all abandoned to despair she sings her sorrows through the night and on the bough sadsitting still at every dying fall takes up again her lamentable strain of winding woe till wide around the woods sigh with her song and with her wail resound and now the feathered youth their former bounds ardent disdain and weighing often their wings demand the free possession of the sky but this glad office more and then dissolves parental love at once for needless grown unlavish wisdom never works in vain it is on some evening sunny grateful mild when naught but balm is breathing through the woods with yellow luster bright that the new tribes visit the spacious heavens and look abroad on natures common far as they can see or wing their range and pasture over the boughs dancing about still at the giddy verge their resolution fails their pinions still in loose libration stretched the void abrupt trembling refuse till down before them fly the parentguides and chide exhort command or push them off the surging air receives the plumy burden and their selftaught wings winnow the waving element on ground alighted bolder up again they lead farther and farther on the lengthning flight till vanished every fear and every power roused into life and action in the void the exonerd parents see their soaring race and once rejoicing never know them more high from the summit of a craggy cliff hung over the green sea grudging at its base the royal eagle draws his young resolved to try them at the sun strongpouncd and bright as burnished day they up the blue sky wind leaving dull sight below and with fixed gaze drink in their native noon the fatherking claps his glad pinions and approves the birth and should i wander to the rural fear whose aged oaks and venerable gloom invite the noisy rook with pleasure there i might the various polity survey of the mixed household kind the careful hen calls all her chirping family around fed and defended by the fearless cock whose breast with ardour flames as on he walks graceful and crows defiance in the pond the finelycheckerd duck before her train rows garrulous the statelysailing swan gives out his snowy plumage to the gale and arching proud his neck with oary feet bears forward fierce and beats you from the bank protective of his young the turkey nigh loudthreatning reddens while the peacock spreads his everycolourd glory to the sun and swims in floating majesty along over the whole homely scene the cooing dove flies thick in amorous chase and wanton rolls the glancing eye and turns the changeful neck while thus the gentle tenants of the shade indulge their purer loves the rougher world of brutes below rush furious into flame and fierce desire through all his lusty veins the bull deepscorchd receives the raging fire of pasture sick and negligent of food scarce seen he wades among the yellow broom while over his brawny back the rambling sprays luxuriant shoot or through the mazy wood dejected wanders nor the enticing bud crops though it presses on his careless sense for wrapped in mad imagination he roars for the fight and idly butting feigns a rival gored in every knotty trunk such should he meet the bellowing war begins their eyes flash fury to the hollowed earth whence the sand flies they mutter bloody deeds and groaning vast the impetuous battle mix while the fair heifer redolent in view stands kindling up their rage the trembling steed with this hot impulse seized in every nerve nor hears the rein nor heeds the sounding whip blows are not felt but tossing high his head and by the wellknown joy to distant plains attracted strong all wild he bursts away over rocks and woods and craggy mountains flies and neighing on the aerial summit takes the informing gale then steepdescending cleaves the headlong torrents foaming down the hills even where the madness of the straightened streams turns in black eddies round such is the force with which his frantic heart and sinews swell nor undelighted by the boundless spring are the broad monsters of the boiling deep from the deep ooze and gelid cavern roused they flounce and tumble in unwieldy joy dire were the strain and dissonant to sing the cruel raptures of the savage kind how the red lioness her whelps forgot amid the thoughtless fury of her heart the lank rapacious wolf the unshapely bear the spotted tiger fellest of the fell and all the terrors of the libyan swain by this new flame their native wrath sublimed roam the resounding waste in fiercer bands and growl their horrid loves but this the theme i sing transported to the british fair forbids and leads me to the mountainbrow where sits the shepherd on the grassy turf inhaling healthful the descending sun around him feeds his manybleating flock of various cadence and his sportive lambs this way and that convolvd in friskful glee their little frolicks play and now the race invites them forth when swift the signal given they start away and sweep the massy mound that runs around the hill the rampart once of iron war in ancient barbarous times when disunited britain ever bled lost in eternal broil ever yet she grew to this deeplaid indissoluble state where wealth and commerce lift their golden head and over our labors liberty and law illustrious watch the wonder of a world what is this mighty breath ye curious say which in a language rather felt than heard instructs the fowls of heaven and through their breasts these arts of love diffuses what but god inspiring god who boundless spirit all and unremitted energy pervades adjusts sustains and agitates the whole he ceaseless works alone and yet alone seems not to work with such perfection framed is this complex amazing scheme of things but though concealed to every purer eye the informing author in his work appears his grandeur in the heavens the sun and moon whether that fires the day or falling this pours out a lucid softness over the night are but a beam from him the glittering stars by the deep ear of meditation heard still in their midnight watches sing of him he nods a calm the tempest blows his wrath roots up the forest and oerturns the main the thunder is his voice and the red flash his speedy sword of justice at his touch the mountains flame he takes the solid earth and rocks the nations nor in these alone in every common instance god is seen and to the man who casts his mental eye abroad unnoticd wonders rise but chief in thee boon spring and in thy softer scenes the smiling god appears while water earth and air attest his bounty which instills into the brutes this temporary thought and annual melts their undesigning hearts profusely thus in tenderness and joy still let my song a nobler note assume and sing the infusive force of spring on man when heaven and earth as if contending vie to raise his being and serene his soul can he forbear to smile with nature can the stormy passions in his bosom roll while every gale is peace and every grove is melody hence from the bounteous walks of flowing spring ye sordid sons of earth hard and unfeeling of anothers woe or only lavish to yourselves away but come ye generous breasts in whose wide thought of all his works creative bounty most divinely burns and on your open front and liberal eye sits from his dark retreat inviting modest want nor only fair and easy of approach your active search leaves no cold wintry corner unexplord like silentworking heaven surprising often the lonely heart with unexpected good for you the roving spirit of the wind blows spring abroad for you the teaming clouds descend in buxom plenty over the world and the sun spreads his genial blaze for you ye flower of human race in these green days sadpining sickness lifts her languid head life flows afresh and youngeyd health exalts the whole creation round contentment walks the sunny glade and feels an inward bliss spring over his mind beyond the power of kings to purchase pure serenity apace induces thought and contemplation still by small degrees the love of nature works and warms the bosom till at last arrived to rapture and enthusiastic heat we feel the present deity and taste the joy of god to see a happy world it is harmony that worldattuning power by which all beings are adjusted each to all around impelling and impelled in endless circulation that inspires this universal smile thus the glad skies the wide rejoicing earth the woods the streams with every life they hold down to the flower that paints the lowly vale or insectwing waved over the shepherds slumber touch the mind to nature tuned with a lightflying hand invisible quickurging through the nerves the glittering spirits in a flood of day hence from the virgins check a fresher bloom shoots less and less the live carnation round her lips blush deeper sweets she breathes of youth the shining moisture swells into her eyes in brighter flow her wishing bosom heaves with palpitations wild kind tumults seize her veins and all her yielding soul is love from the keen gaze her lover turns away full of the dear ecstatic power and sick with sighing languishment ah then ye fair be greatly cautious of your sliding hearts dare not the infectious sigh the pleading eye in meek submission dressed deject and low but full of tempting guile let not the tongue prompt to deceive with adulation smooth gain on your purposed wills nor in the bower where woodbines flaunt and roses shed a couch while evening draws her crimson curtains round trust your soft minutes with betraying man and let the aspiring youth beware of love of the smooth glance beware for it is too late when on his heart the torrent softness pours then wisdom prostrate lies and fading fame dissolves in air away while the fond soul is wrapped in dreams of ecstacy and bliss still paints the illusive form the kindling grace the enticing smile the modestseeming eye beneath whose beauteous beams belying heaven lurk searchless cunning cruelty and death and still falsewarbling in his cheated ear her siren voice enchanting draws him on to guileful shores and meads of fatal joy even present in the very lap of love inglorious laid while music flows around perfumes and oils and wine and wanton hours amid the roses fierce repentance rears her snaky crest a quick returning twinge shoots through the conscious heart where honor still and great design against the oppressive load of luxury by fits impatient heave but absent what fantastic pangs arrousd rage in each thought by restless musing fed chill the warm cheek and blast the bloom of life neglected fortune flies and sliding swift prone into ruin fall his scorned affairs it is naught but gloom around the darkened sun loses his light the rosybosomd spring to weeping fancy pines and yon bright arch of heaven lowbends into a dusky vault all nature fades extinct and she alone heard felt and seen possesses every thought fills every sense and pants in every vein books are but formal dullness tedious friends and sad amid the social band he sits lonely and inattentive from the tongue the unfinished period falls while borne away on swelling thought his wafted spirit flies to the vain bosom of his distant fair and leaves the semblance of a lover fixed in melancholy site with head declined and lovedejected eyes sudden he starts shook from his tender trance and restless runs to glimmering shades and sympathetick glooms where the dun umbrage over the falling stream romantic hangs there through the pensive dusk strays in heartthrilling meditation lost indulging all to love or on the bank thrown amid drooping lillies swells the breeze with sighs unceasing and the brook with tears thus in soft anguish he consumes the day nor quits his deep retirement till the moon peeps through the chambers of the fleecy east enlightened by degrees and in her train leads on the gentle hours then forth he walks beneath the trembling languish of her beams with softened soul and wooes the bird of eve to mingle woes with his or while the world and all the sons of care lie hushed in sleep associates with the midnight shadows drear and sighing to the lonely taper pours his idlytorturd heart into the page meant for the moving messenger of love where rapture burns on rapture every line with rising frenzy fired but if on bed delirious flung sleep from his pillow flies all night he tosses nor the balmy power in any posture finds till the gray morn lifts her pale luster on the paler wretch exanimate by love and then perhaps exhausted nature sinks a while to rest still interrupted by distracted dreams that over the sick imagination rise and in black colors paint the mimick scene often with the enchantress of his soul he talks sometimes in crowds distressed or if retired to secretwinding flowerenwoven bowers far from the dull impertinence of man just as he credulous his thousand cares begins to lose in blind oblivious love snatched from her yielded hand he knows not how through forests huge and long untraveld heaths with desolation brown he wanders waste in night and tempest wrapped or shrinks aghast back from the bending precipice or wades the turbid stream below and strives to reach the farther shore where succourless and sad wild as a bacchanal she spreads her arms but strives in vain borne by the outrageous flood to distance down he rides the ridgy wave or whelmed beneath the boiling eddy sinks then a weak wailing lamentable cry is heard and all in tears he wakes again to tread the circle of revolving woe these are the charming agonies of love whose misery delights but through the heart should jealousy its venom once diffuse it is then delightful misery no more but agony unmixed incessant rage corroding every thought and blasting all loves paradise ye fairy prospects then ye beds of roses and ye bowers of joy farewell ye gleamings of departing peace shine out your last the yellow tinging plague internal vision taints and in a night of livid gloom imagination wraps ay then instead of loveenlivend cheeks of funny features and of ardent eyes with flowing raptures bright dark looks succeed suffusd and glaring with untender fire a clouded aspect and a burning cheek where the whole poisoned soul malignant sits and frightens love away ten thousand fears invented wild ten thousand frantic views of horrid rivals hanging on the charms for which he melts in fondness eat him up with fervent anguish and consuming pine in vain reproaches lend their idle aid deceitful pride and resolution frail giving a moments ease reflection pours afresh her beauties on his busy thought her first endearments twining round the soul with all the witchcraft of ensnaring love strait the fierce storm involves his mind anew flames through the nerves and boils along the veins while anxious doubt distracts the tortured heart for even the sad assurance of his fears were peace to what he feels thus the warm youth whom love deludes into his thorny wilds through flowerytempting paths or leads a life of feaverd rapture or of cruel care his brightest aims extinguished all and all his lively moments running down to waste but happy they the happiest of their kind whom gentler stars unite and in one fate their hearts their fortunes and their beings blend it is not the coarser tie of human laws unnatural often and foreign to the mind that binds their peace but harmony itself attuning all their passions into love where friendship fullexerts his softest power perfect esteem enlivened by desire ineffable and sympathy of soul thought meeting thought and will preventing will with boundless confidence for naught but love can answer love and render bliss secure let him ungenerous who alone intent to bless himself from sordid parents buys the loathing virgin in eternal care wellmerited consume his nights and days let barbarous nations whose inhuman love is wild desire fierce as the suns they feel let eastern tyrants from the light of heaven seclude their bosomslaves meanly possessed of a mere lifeless violated form while those whom love cements in holy faith and equal transport free as nature live disdaining fear for what is the world to them its pomp its pleasure and its nonsense all who in each other clasp whatever fair high fancy forms and lavish hearts can wish something than beauty dearer should they look or on the mind or mindillumind face truth goodness honor harmony and love the richest bounty of indulgent heaven meantime a smiling offspring rises round and mingles both their graces by degrees the human blossom blows and every day soft as it rolls along shows some new charm the fathers luster and the mothers bloom then infant reason grows apace and calls for the kind hand of an assiduous care delightful task to rear the tender thought to teach the young idea how to shoot to pour the fresh instruction over the mind to breathe the inspiring spirit and to plant the generous purpose in the glowing breast oh speak the joy you whom the sudden tear surprises often while you look around and nothing strikes your eye but sights of bliss all various nature pressing on the heart obedient fortune and approving heaven these are the blessings of diviner love and thus their moments fly the seasons thus as ceaseleless round a jarring world they roll still find them happy and consenting spring sheds her own rosy garland on their head till evening comes at last cool gentle calm when after the long vernal day of life enamored more as soul approaches soul together down they

attractive force as with a chain indissoluble bound thy system rolls entire from the far bourne of slowpaced saturn to the scarce seen disk of mercury lost in excessive blaze informer of the planetary train without whose vital and effectual glance they would be brute uncomfortable mass and not as now the green abodes of life how many forms of being wait on thee inhaling gladness from the unfettered mind by thee sublimed to that dayliving race the mixing myriads of thy setting beam the vegetable world is also thine parent of seasons from whose richstaind rays reflected various various colors rise

surface form a trembling variance of revolving hues as the site varies in the gazers hand the very dead creation from thy touch assumes a mimic life by thee refined in brisker measures the relucent stream frisks over the mead the precipice abrupt projecting horror on the blackened flood softens at thy return the desert joys wildly through all his melancholy bounds rude ruins glitter and the briny deep seen from some pointed promontorys top reflects from every fluctuating wave a glance extensive as the day but these and all the much transported muse can sing are to thy beauty dignity and use unequal far great delegated source of light and life and grace and joy below how shall i then attempt to sing of him who light himself in uncreated light invested deep dwells awfully retired from mortal eye or angels purer ken whose single smile has from the first of time  filled overflowing all those lamps of heaven that beam for ever through the boundless sky but should he hide his face the astonished sun and all the extinguished stars would loosening reel wide from their spheres and chaos come again and yet was every faultering tongue of man almighty poet silent in thy praise thy

heat dispreading through the sky by sharp degrees his burning influence reigns on man and beast and herb and tepid stream who can unpitying see the flowery race shed by the morn their newflushd bloom resign before the unbating beam so fade the fair when fevers revel through their azure veins but one the follower of the sun they say sad when he sets shuts up her yellow leaves weeping all night and when he warm returns points her enamored bosom to his ray home from his morning task the swain retreats his flock before him stepping to the fold while the fulludderd mother lows around the cheerful cottage then expecting food the food of innocence and health the daw the rook and magpie to the greygrown oaks that the calm village in their verdant arms sheltering embrace direct their lazy flight where on the mingling boughs they sit embowerd all the hot noon till cooler hours arise faint underneath the homely fowls convene and in a corner of the buzzing shade the house dog with the employless greyhound lies outstretchd and sleepy in his slumbers one attacks the nightly thief and one exults over hill and dale till wakened by the wasp they bootless snap nor shall the muse disdain to let the

rivers birds of season considered that now shift their habitation the prodigious number of them that cover the northern and western isles of scotland hence a view of the country a prospect of the discolored fading woods after a gentle dusky day moonlight autumnal meteors morning to which succeeds a calm pure sunshine day such as usually shuts up the season the harvest being gathered in the country dissolved in joy the whole concludes with a panegyric on a philosophical country life  autumn crowned with the sickle and the wheaten shear while autumn nodding over the yellow plain comes

source of every gentle art and all the soft civility of life raiser of human kind by nature cast naked and helpless out amid the woods and wilds to rude inclement elements with various powers of deep efficiency implanted and profusely poured around materials infinite but idle all still unexerted in the unconscious breast slept the lethargic powers corruption still voracious swallowed what the liberal hand of bounty scattered over the savage year and still the sad barbarian roving mixed with beasts of prey or for his acronmeal fought the fierce tusky boar a shivering wretch aghast and comfortless when the red north with winter charged let the mixed tempest fly hail rain and snow and bitterbreathing frost then to the shelter of the hut he fled and the wild season sordid pined away for home he had not home is the resort of love of joy of peace and plenty where supporting and supported polished friends and dear relations mingle into bliss but this the rugged savage never felt even desolate in crowds and thus his days rolled heavy dark and unenjoyd along a waste of time till industry approached and roused him from his miserable sloth his faculties unfolded pointed out where lavish nature the directing hand of art demanded showed him how to raise his feeble force by the mechanic powers to dig the mineral from the vaulted earth on what to turn the piercing rage of fire on what the torrent and the gathered blast gave the tall ancient forest to his ax taught him to chip the wood and hew the stone till by degrees the finished fabric rose tore from his limbs the bloodpolluted fur and wrapped them in the woolly vestment warm or bright in glossy silk and flowing lawn with wholesome viands filled his table poured the generous glass around inspired to wake the

widehover round you like the fowls of heaven and ask their humble dole the various turns of fortune ponder that your sons may want what now with hard reluctance faint ye give the lovely young lavinia once had friends and fortune smiled deceitful on her birth for in her helpless years deprived of all of every stay save innocence and heaven she with her widowed mother feeble old and poor lived in a cottage lost far up amid the windings of a woody vale safe from the cruel blasting arts of man almost on natures common bounty fed like the gay birds that sung them to repose content and careless of tomorrows fare her form was fresher than the morningrose when the dew wets its leaves unstained and pure as is the lilly or the mountain snow the modest virtues mingled in her eyes still on the ground deject and darting all their humid beams into the blooming flowers or when the stories that her mother told of what her faithless fortune flattered once thrilled in her thought they like the dewy star of evening shone in tears a native grace sat fairproportiond on her polished limbs veiled in a simple robe for loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament but is when unadorned adorned the most thoughtless of beauty she was beautys self recluse among the woods if citydames will deign their faith and thus she went compelled by strong necessity with as serene and pleased a look as patience can put on to glean palaemons fields the pride of swains palaemon was the generous and the rich who led the rural life in all its joy and elegance such as arcadian song transmits from ancient incorrupted times when tyrant custom had not shackled man and free to follow nature was the mode he then his fancy with autumnal scenes amusing chanced beside his reapertrain to walk when poor lavinia drew his eye unconscious of her power and turning quick with unaffected blushes from his gaze he saw her charming but he saw not half the charms her downcast modesty concealed that very moment love and chaste desire sprung in his bosom to himself unknown for still the world prevailed and its dread laugh which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn should his heart own a gleaner in the field and thus in secret to his soul he sighed what pity that so delicate a form by beauty kindled and harmonious shaped where sense sincere and goodness seemed to dwell should be devoted to the rude embrace of some indecent clown she looks methinks of old acastos line and to my mind recalls that patron of my happy life from whom my liberal fortune took its rise now to the dust gone down his houses lands and once fairspreading family dissolved i have heard that in some waste obscure retreat urged by remembrance sad and decent pride far from those scenes which knew their better days his aged widow and his daughter live whom yet my fruitless search could never find romantic wish would this the daughter were when strict enquiring from herself he found she was the same the daughter of his friend the bountiful acasto who can speak the mingling passion that surpised his heart and through his nerves in shivering transport ran then blazed his smothered flame avowed and bold and as he run her ardent over and over love gratitude and pity wept at once confused and frightened at his sudden tears her rising beauties flushed a higher bloom as thus paleemon passionate and just poured out the pious rapture of his soul and art thou then acastos dear remains she whom my restless gratitude has sought so long in vain oh yes the very same the softened image of my noble friend alive his every feature every look more elegantly touched fairer than spring thou sole surviving blossom from the root that nourished up my fortune say ah where in what unsmiling desert have thou drawn the kindest aspect of delighted heaven into such beauty spread and blown so white though povertys cold wind and crashing rain beat keen and heavy on thy tender years o let me now into a richer soil transplant thee safe where vernal suns and showers diffuse their warmest largest influence and of my garden be the pride and joy it ill befits thee oh it ill befits acastos daughter his whose open stores though vast were little to his ampler heart the father of a country thus to pick the very refuse of those harvestfields his bounty taught to gain and right enjoy then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand but ill applied to such a rugged task with harvest shining all these fields are thine and if my wishes may presume so far their master too who then indeed were blessed to make the daughter of acasto so here ceased the youth yet still his speaking eye expressed the sacred triumph of his soul with conscious virtue gratitude and love above the vulgar joy divinely raised nor waited he reply won by the charm of goodness irresistible and all in sweet disorder lost she blushed consent the news immediate to her mother brought while pierced with anxious thought she pined away the lonely moments for lavinias fate amazed and scarce believing what she heard joy seized her withered veins and one bright gleam of setting life shone on her eveninghours not less enraptured than the happy pair who flourished long in mutual bliss and reared a numerous offspring lovely like themselves and good the grace of all the country round defeating often the labors of the year the sultry south collects a potent blast at first the groves are scarcely seen to stir their trembling tops and a still murmur runs along the softinclining fields of corn but as the aereal tempest fuller swells and in one mighty stream invisible immense the whole excited atmosphere impetuous rushes over the sounding world strained to the root the stooping forest pours a rustling shower of yet untimely leaves highbeat the circling mountains eddy in from the bare wild the dissipated storm and send it in a torrent down the vale exposed and naked to its utmost rage through all the sea of harvest rolling round the billowy plain boils wide nor can evade though plyant to the blast its seizing force or whirled in air or into vacant chaff shook waste and sometimes too a burst of rain swept from the black horizon broad descends in one continuous flood still over head the glomerating tempest grows and still the deluge deepens till the fields around ly sunk and flatted in the sordid wave sudden the ditches swell the meadows swim red from the hills innumerable streams tumultuous roar and high above its banks the river lift before whose weighty rush herds flocks and harvests cottages and swains roll mingled down all that the winds had spared in one wild moment ruined the big hopes and wellearnd treasures of the painful year fled to some eminence the husbandman helpless beholds the miserable wreck driving along his drowning ox at once descending with his labors scattered round he sees and instant over his shivering thought comes winter unprovided and a train of clamant children dear ye masters then be mindful of the rough laborious hand that sinks you soft in elegance and ease be mindful of those limbs in russet clad whose toil to yours is warmth and graceful pride and oh be mindful of that sparing board which covers yours with luxury profuse makes your glass sparkle and your sense rejoice nor cruelly demand what the deep rains and allinvolving winds have swept away here the rude clamor of the sportsmans joy the gun thickthundering and the winded horn would tempt the muse to ling the rural game how in his midcareer the spaniel struck stiff by the tainted gale with open nose outstretchd and finely sensible draws full fearful and cautious on the latent prey as in the sun the circling covey bask their varied plumes watchful and every way through the rough stubble turned the secret eye caught in the meshy snare in vain they beat their useless wings entangled more and more nor on the surges of the boundless air though borne triumphant are they safe the gun glanced just and sudden from the fowlers eye oertakes their sounding pinions and again immediate brings them from the towering wing dead to the ground or drives them else dispersed wounded and wheeling various down the wind these are not subjects for the peaceful muse nor will she stain her spotless theme with such then most delighted when she smiling sees the whole mixed animal creation round alive and happy it is not joy to her this falsely cheerful barbarous game of death this rage of pleasure which the restless youth awakes impatient with the gleaming morn when beasts of prey retire that all night long urged by necessity had roamd the dark as if their conscious ravage shunned the light ashamed not so the steady tyrant man who with the thoughtless insolence of power inflamed beyond the most infuriate rage of the worst monster that ever howled the waste for sport alone takes up the cruel tract amid the beamings of the gentle days upbraid us not ye wolves ye tigers fell for hunger kindles you and lawless want but lavish fed in natures bounty rolled to laugh at anguish and rejoice in blood is what your horrid bosoms never knew poor is the triumph over the timid hare shook from the corn and now to some lone seat retired the rushy fen the ragged furz stretched over the stony heath the stubble chapt the thistly lawn the thick entangled broom of the same friendly hue the withered fern the fallow ground laid open to the sun concoctive and the nodding sandy bank hung over the mazes of the mountainbrook vain is her best precaution though she sits by nature raised to take the horizon in and head couched close betwixt her hairy feet in act to spring away the scented dew betrays her early labyrinth and deep in scattered sullen openings far behind with every breeze she hears the coming storm but nearer and more frequent as it loads the sighing gale she springs amazed and all the savage soul of game is up at once the pack fullopening varions the shrill horn resounded from the hills the neighing steed wild for the chase and the loud hunters shout over a weak harmless flying creature all mixed in mad tumult and discordant joy the stag too singled from the herd where long he ranged the branching monarch of the shades before the tempest drives at first in speed he sprightly puts his faith and feararousd gives all his swift aereal soul to flight against the breeze he darts that way the more to leave the lessening murderous cry behind deception short though fleeter than the winds blown over the keenaird mountain by the north he bursts the thickets glances through the glades and plunges deep into the wildest wood if slow yet sure adhesive to the tract hotsteaming up behind him comes again the inhuman rout and from the shady depth expel him circling through his every shift he sweeps the forest often and sobbing sees the glades mildopening to the golden day where in kind contest with his butting friends he went to struggle or his loves enjoy often in the fulldescending flood he tries to lose the scent and lave his burning sides often seeks the herd the watchful herd alarmed with quick consent avoid the infectious maze what shall he do his once so vivid nerves so full of buoyant soul inspire no more the fainting course but wrenching breathless toil sick seizes on his heart he stands at bay and puts his last weak refuge in despair the big round tears run down his dappled face he groans in anguish while the growling pack bloodhappy hang at his fair jutting chest and mark his beauteous checkered sides with gore of this enough but if the silvan youth whose fervent blood boils into violence must have the chase behold despising flight the rousdup lion resolute and slow advancing full on the protended spear and cowardband that circling wheel aloof slunk from the cavern and the troubled wood see the grim wolf on him his shaggy foe viudictive fix for murder is his trade and growling horrid as the brindled boar grins near destruction to the monsters heart let the dart lighten from the nervous arm these britain knows not give ye britons then your sportive fury pityless to pour loose on the sly destroyer of the flock him from his craggy winding haunts unearthd let all the thunder of the chase pursue throw the broad ditch behind you over the hedge highbound resistless nor the deep morass refuse but through the shaking wilderness pick your nice way into the perilous flood bear fearless of the raging instinct full and as you ride the torrent to the banks your triumph sound sonorous running round from rock to rock in circling echo tossed then snatch the mountains by their woody tops rush down the dangerous steep and over the lawn in fancy swallowing up the space between pour all your speed into the rapid game for happy he who tops the wheeling chase has every maze evolvd and every guile disclosed who knows the merits of the pack who saw the villain seized and dying hard without complaint though by an hundred mouths at once tore mercyless thrice happy he at hour of dusk while the retreating horn calls them to ghostly halls of gray renown with woodland honors graced the foxs fur depending decent from the roof and spread round the drear walls with antic figures fierce the stags large front he then is loudest heard when the night staggers with severer toils and their repeated wonders shake the dome but first the fueld chimney blazes wide the tankards foam and the strong table groans beneath the smoking sirloin stretched immense from side to side on which with fell intent they deep incision make and talk the while of englands glory never to be defaced while hence they borrow vigor or amain into the pasty plunged at intervals if stomach keen can intervals allow relating how it ran and how it fell then sated hunger bids his brother thirst produce the mighty bowl the mighty bowl swelled high with fiery juice steams liberal round a potent gale reviving as the breath of maia to the lovesick shepherdess on violets diffused while soft she hears her panting shepherd stealing to her arms nor wanting is the brown october drawn mature and perfect from his dark retreat of thirty years and now his honest front flames in the light refulgent nor ashamed to vie it with the vineyards best produce perhaps a while amusive thoughtful whisk walks gentle round beneath a cloud of smoke wreathed fragrant from the pipe or the quick dice in thunder leaping from the box awake the sounding gammon while romploving miss is hauld about in gallantry robust at last these puling idlenesses laid aside frequent and full the dry divan close in firm circle and set ardent in for serious drinking nor evasion sly nor sober shift is to the puking wretch indulged askew but earnest brimming bowls lave every soul the table floating round and pavement faithless to the fuddled foot thus as they swim in mutual swill the talk vociferate at once by twenty tongues reels fast from theme to theme from horses hounds to church or mistress politics or ghost in endless mazes intricate perplexed meantime with sudden interruption loud the impatient catch bursts from the joyous heart that moment touched is every kindred soul and opening in a fullmouthed cry of joy the laugh the slap the jocund curse goes round while from their slumbers shook the kenneld hounds mix in the music of the day again as when the tempest that has vexed the deep the dark night long falls murmuring toward morn so their mirth gradual sinks their feeble tongues unable to take up the cumbrous word ly quite disslovd before their maudlin eyes seen dim and blue the double tapers dance like the sun wading through the misty sky then sliding sweet they drop oerturnd above lies the wet broken scene and stretched below each way the drunken slaughter where astride the lubber power himself triumphant sits slumbrous inclining still from side to side and steeps them silent all in sleep till morn but if the rougher sex by this red sport are hurried wild let not such horrid joy ever stain the bosom of the british fair far be the spirit of the chase from them uncomely courage unbeseeming skill to spring the fence to rein the prancing steed the cap the whip the masculine attire in which they roughen to the sense and all the winning softness of their sex is lost made up of blushes tenderness and fears in them it is graceful to dissolve at woe with every motion every word to wave quick over the kindling cheek the ready blush and from the smallest violence to shrink unequal then the loveliest in their fears and by this silent adulation soft to their protection more engaging man o may their eyes no miserable sight save weeping lovers see a nobler game through loves enchanting wiles pursued yet fled in chase ambiguous may their tender limbs float in the loose simplicity of dress and fashioned all to harmony alone know they to seize the captivated soul in rapture warbled from the radiant lip to teach the lute to languish with smooth step disclosing motion in its every charm to swim along and swell the mazy dance to train the foliage over the snowy lawn to play the pencil turn the instructive page to give new flavor to the fruitful

shower and of an ardent brown as are the ringlets of melindas hair melinda formed with every grace complete yet these neglecting above beauty wise and far transcending such a vulgar praise hence from

deeploaded bough a mellow shower incessant melts away the juicy pear lies in a soft profusion scattered round a various sweetness swells the gentle race in species different but in kind the same by natures allrefining hand prepared of tempered sun and water earth and air in everchanging composition mixed so fares it with those wideprojected heaps of apples which the lustyhanded year innumerous

rich with harvest and there white with flocks mean time the grandeur of thy lofty dome farsplendid seizes on the ravished eye new beauties rise with each revolving day new columns swell and still the

the sunny rocks from cliff to cliff increased the heightened blaze low bend the gravid boughs the clusters clear half through the foliage seen or ardent flame or shine transparent while perfection breathes white over the turgent film the living dew as thus they brighten with exalted juice touched into flavor by the mingling ray the rural youth and virgins over the field each fond for each to cull the autumnal prime exulting rove and speak the vintage nigh then comes the crushing swain the country floats and foams unbounded with the mashy flood that by degrees fermented and refined round the raised nations pours the cup of joy the claret smooth deep as the lip we press in sparkling fancy while we drain the bowl the mellowtasted burgundy and quick as is the wit it gives the bright champaign now by the cool declining year condensed descend the copious exhalations checked as up the middle sky unseen they stole and roll the doubling sogs around the hill no more the mountain horrid vast sublime who pours a sweep of rivers from his sides and deep betwixt contending kingdoms lays the rocky long division while aloft his piny top is lessening lost in air no more his thousand prospects fill the view with great variety but in a night of gathering vapor from the bassled sense sink dark and total nor alone immerst the huge dusk gradual swallows up the plain vanish the woods the dimseen river seems sullen and slow to roll the misty wave even in the height of noon oppressed the sun sheds weak and blunt his widerefracted ray whence glaring often with many a broadend orb he frights the nations indistinct on earth seen through the turbid air beyond the life objects appear and wilderd over the waste the shepherd stalks gigantick till at last wreathed close around in deeper circles still successive floating sits the general fog unbounded over the world and mingling thick a formless gray confusion covers all as when of old so sung the hebrew bard light uncollected through the chaos urged its infant way nor order yet had drawn his endless train forth from the dubious gloom these roving mists that constant now begin to smoke along the hilly country these with mighty rains the skilled in nature say the mountaincisterns fill those grand reserves of water scoopd among the hollow rocks whence gush the streams the ceaseless fountains play and their unfailing stores the rivers draw but is this equal to the vast effect is thus the volga filled the rapid rhine the broad euphrates all the unnumberd floods that large refresh the fairdivided earth and in the rage of summer never cease to send a thundering torrent to the main what though the sun draws from the steaming deep more than the rivers pour how much again over the vexed surge in bitterdriving showers frequent returns let the wet sailor say and on the thirsty down far from the burst of springs how much to their reviving fields and feeding flocks let lonely shepherds sing but sure it is no weak variable cause that keeps at once ten thousand thousand floods widewandering over the world so fresh and clear for ever flowing and for ever full and thus some sages deepexploring teach that where the hoarse innumerable wave eternal lashes the refounding shore sucked through the sandy stratum every way the waters with the sandy stratum rise amid whole angles infinitely strained they leave each saline particle behind and clear and sweeten as they soak along nor stops the restless fluid mounting still though here and there in lowly plains it springs but to the mountain courted by the sand that leads it darkling on in faithful maze far from the parentmain it boils again fresh into day and all the glittering hill is bright with spouting rills the vital stream hence in its subterranean passage gains from the washed mineral that restoring power and salutary virtue which anew strings every nerve calls up the kindling soul into the healthful cheek and joyous eye and whence the royal

from their own clear north in radiant streams bright over europe bursts the boreal morn oh is there not some patriot in whose power that best that godlike luxury is placed of blessing thousands thousands yet unborn through late posterity some large of soul to cheer dejected industry to give a double harvest to the pining swain and teach the laboring hand the sweets of toil how by the finest

lowwhispering lead into their leafstrown walks and give the season in its latest view meantime lightshadowing all a sober calm fleeces unbounded either whose least wave stands tremulous uncertain where to turn the gentle current while illumined wide the dewyskirted clouds imbibe the sun and through their uvid pores his tempered force shed over the peaceful world then is the time for those whom wisdom and whom nature charm to steal themselves from the degenerate crowd and soar above this little scene of things to tread lowthoughted vice beneath their feet to sooth the throbbing passions into peace and woo lone quiet in her silent walks thus solitary and in pensive guise often let me wander over the russet mead and through the saddend grove where scarce is heard one dying strain to cheer the woodmans toil happily some widowed songster pours his plaint far in saint warblings through the tawny copse while congregated thrushes linnets larks and each wild throat whose artless strains so late swelled all the music of the swarming shades robbed of their tuneful souls now shivering sit on the dead tree a dull despondent flock with not a brightness waving over their plumes and naught save chattering discord in their note o let not aimed from some inhuman eye the gun the music of the coming year destroy and harmless unsuspecting harm lay the weak tribes a miserable prey in mingled murder fluttering on the ground the pale descending year yet pleasing still a gentler mood inspires for now the leaf incessant rustles from the mournful grove often starting such as studious walk below and slowly circles through the waving air but should a quicker breeze and the boughs sob over the sky the leafy rain streams till choked and matted with the dreary shower the forestwalks at every rising gale roll wide the withered waste and whistle bleak fled is the blasted verdure of the fields and shrunk into their beds the flowery race their sunny robes resign even what remained of bolder fruits falls from the naked tree and woods fields gardens orchards all around the desolated prospect thrills the soul he comes he comes in every breeze the power of philosophic melancholy comes his near approach the suddenstarting tear the glowing cheek the mild dejected air the softened feature and the beating heart pierced deep with many a secret pang declare over all his soul his sacred influence breathes in all the bosom triumphs all the nerves inflames imagination through the sense infuses every tenderness and far beyond dim earth exalts the swelling thought ten thousand thousand fleet ideas such as never mingled with the vulgars dream crowd fast into the minds creative eye as fast the correspondent passions rise as varied and as high devotion raised to rapture and divine astonishment the love of nature unconfined and chief of human kind the large ambitious wish to make them blessed the sigh for suffering worth lost in obscurity the indignant scorn of mighty pride the fearless great resolve the wonder that the dying patriot draws inspiring glory through remotest time the arousing pant for virtue and for fame the sympathies of love and friendship dear with all the social offspring of the heart oh bear me then to vast embowering shades to twilight groves and visionary vales to weeping grottoes and prophetic glooms where angelforms athwart the solemn dusk tremendous sweep or seem to sweep along and voices more than human through the void deepsounding seize the enthusiastic ear and now the western sun withdraws the day and humid evening gilding over the sky in her chill progress to the ground condensed the ascending vapor throws where waters ooze where marshes stagnate and where rivers wind cluster the rolling fogs and swim along the duskymantled lawn meanwhile the moon fullorbd and breaking through the scattered clouds shows her broad visage in the crimsoned east turned to the sun direct her spotted disk where mountains rise umbrageous dales descend and oceans roll as optic tube descries a lesser earth gives all his blaze again void of its flame and sheds a softer day now through the passing cloud she seems to stoop now up the pure cerulean rides sublime wide the pale deluge floats and streaming mild over the skyd mountain to the shadowy vale while rocks and floods reflect the quivering gleam the whole air whitens with a boundless tide of silver radiance trembling round the world but when halfblotted from the sky her light fainting permits the starry fires to burn with keener luster through the depth of heaven or quite extinct her deadend orb appears and scarce appears of sickly beamless white often in this season silent from the north a blaze of meteors shoots ensweeping first the lower skies then all at once converge high to the crown of heaven and all at once relapsing quick as quickly reascend and mix and thwart extinguish and renew all either coursing in a maze of light from look to look contagious

magnificent and vast are heaven and earth order confounded lies all beauty void distinction lost and gay variety one universal blot such the fair power of light to kindle and create the whole drear is the state of the benighted wretch who then bewildered wanders through the dark full of pale fancies and chimeras huge nor visited by one directive ray from cottage streaming or from airy hall perhaps impatient as he stumbles on struck from the root of slimy ruses blue the wildfire scatters round or gathertd trails a length of flame deceitful over the moss whither decoyed by the fantastic blaze now sunk and now renewed he is quite absorpt rider and horse into the miry gulf while still from day to day his pining wife and plaintive children his return await in wild conjecture lost at other times sent by the better genius of the night innoxious gleaming on the horses mane the meteor sits and shows the narrow path that winding leads through pits of death or else instructs him how to take the dangerous ford the lengthened night elapsed the morning shines serene in all her dewy beauty bright unfolding fair the last autumnal day and now the mounting sun dispels the fog the rigid hoarfrost melts before his beam and hung on every spray on every blade of grass the myriad dewdrops twinkle round ah see where robbed and murdered in that pit lies the still heaving hive at evening snatched beneath the cloud of guiltconcealing night and whelmed over sulphur while undreaming ill the happy people in their waxen cells sat tending public cares and planning schemes of temperance for winter

a heavy gloom oppressive over the world through nature shedding influence malign and rouses all the seeds of dark disease the soul of man dies in him loathing life and black with horrid views the cattle droop the conscious head and over the furrowed land red from the plow the dun discolored flocks untended spreading crop the wholesome root along the woods along the moorish fens sighs the sad genius of the coming storm and up among the loose disjointed cliffs and fracturd mountains wild the brawling brook and cave presageful send a hollow moan resounding long in listening fancys ear then comes the father of the tempest forth striding the gloomy blast first rains obscure drive through the mingling skies with vapor vile dash on the mountains brow and shake the woods that grumbling wave below the unsightly plain lies a brown deluge as the lowbent clouds pour flood on flood yet unexhausted still combine and deepening into night shut up the days fair face the wanderers of heaven each to his home retire save those that love to take their pastime in the troubled air or skimming flutter round the dimply pool the cattle from the untasted fields return and ask with meaning low their wonted stalls or ruminate in the contiguous shade thither the household feathery people crowd the crested cock with all his female train pensive and wet meanwhile the cottageswain hangs over the enlivening blaze and taleful there recounts his simple frolic much he talks and much he laughs nor recks the storm that blows without and rattles on his humble roof wide over the brim with many a torrent swelled and the mixed ruins of its banks overspread at last the rousdup river pours along resistless roaring dreadful down it comes from the chapt mountain and the mossy wild tumbling through rocks abrupt and sounding far then over the sanded valley floating spreads calm sluggish silent till again constrained betwixt two meeting hills it bursts away where rocks and woods oerhang the turbid stream there gathering triple force rapid and deep it boils and wheels and foams and thunders through nature great parent whose continual hand rolls round the seasons of the changeful year how mighty how majesty are thy works with what a pleasing dread they swell the soul that sees astonished and astonished sings ye too ye winds that now begin to blow with boisterous sweep i raise my voice to you where are your stores ye subtle beings say where your aerial magazines reserved against the day of tempest perilous in what fardistant region of the sky hushed in dead silence sleep you when it is calm late in the lowering sky red fiery streaks begin to flush about the reeling clouds stagger with dizzy poise as doubting yet which master to obey while rising slow blank in the leadencolourd east the moon wears a wan circle round her sullied orb the stars obtuse emit a shivering ray snatched in short eddies plays the fluttering straw loud shrieks the soaring hern and skreaming wild the circling seafowl rise while from the shore eat into caverns by the restless wave and forestrustling mountain comes a voice that solemnsounding bids the world prepare then issues forth the storm with mad control and the thin fabric of the pillard air oerturns at once prone on the passive main descends the ethereal force and with strong gust turns from the bottom the discolored deep through the loud night that bids the waves arise lashed into foam the fierce conflicting brine seems as it sparkles all around to burn meantime whole oceans heaving to the clouds and in broad billows rolling gathered seas surge over surge burst in a general roar and anchored navies from their stations drive wild as the winds athwart the howling waste of mighty waters now the hilly wave straining they scale and now impetuous shoot into the secret chambers of the deep the fullblown baltic thundering over their head emerging thence again before the breath of allexerted heaven they wing their course and dart on distant coasts if some sharp rock or sand insidious break not their career and in loose fragments fling them floating round nor raging here alone unreind at sea to land the tempest bears and over the cliff where screams the seamew foaming unconfined fierce swallows up the longresounding shore the mountain growls and all its sturdy sons stoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade lone on its midnight side and all aghast the dark wayfaring stranger breathless toils and often falling climbs against the blast low waves the rooted forest vexed and sheds what of its tarnishd honors yet remain dashed down and scattered by the tearing winds assiduous fury its gigantic limbs thus struggling through the dissipated grove the whirling tempest raves along the plain and on the cottage thatched or lordly roof keenfastening shakes them to the solid base sleep frighted flies and round the rocking dome for entrance eager howls the savage blast  heavy they roll their fleecy world along and the sky saddens with the gathered storm through the hushed air the whitening shower descends at first thinwavering till at last the flakes fall broad and wide and fast dimming the day with a continual flow sudden the fields put on their winterrobe of purest white it is brightness all save where the new snow melts along the mazy stream the leafless woods bow their hoar heads and ere the languid sun faint from the west emits his evening ray earths universal face deephid and chill is one wild dazzling waste the labourerox stands covered over with snow and then demands the fruit of all his toil the fowls of heaven tamed by the cruel season crowd around the winnowing store and claim the little boon that providence allows the redbreast sole wisely regardful of the embroiling sky in joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves his shivering fellows and to trusted man his annual visit pays new to the dome against the window beats then brisk alights on the warm hearth and hopping over the floor eyes all the smiling family askance and pecks and starts and wonders where he is till more familiar grown the tablecrumbs attract his slender feet the foodless wilds pour forth their brown inhabitants the hare though timorous of heart and hard beset by death in various forms dark snares and dogs and more unpitying men the garden seeks urged on by fearless want the bleating kind eye the bleak heaven and next the glistening earth with looks of dumb despair then sad dispersed dig for the whitherd herb through heaps of snow now shepherds to your helpless charge be kind baffle the raging year and fill their pens with food at will lodge them below the storm and watch them strict for from the bellowing east in this dire season often the whirlwinds wing sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains in one wide waft and over the hapless flocks hid in the hollow of two neighboring hills the billowy tempest whelms till upwards urged the valley to a shining mountain swells tript with a wreath highcurling in the sky as thus the snows arise and foul and fierce all winter drives along the darkened air in his own looserevolving fields the swain disasterd stands sees other hills ascend of unknown joyless brow and other scenes of horrid prospect shag the trackless plain nor finds the river nor the forest hid beneath the white abrupt but wanders on from hill to dale still more and more astray impatient flouncing through the drifted heaps stung with the thoughts of home the thoughts of home rush on his nerves and call their vigor forth in many a vain effort how sinks his soul what black despair what horror fills his heart when for the dusky spot that fancy feigned his tufted cottage rising through the snow he meets the roughness of the middle waste far from the tract and blessed abode of man while round him night resistless closes fast and every tempest howling over his head renders the savage wilderness more wild then throng the busy shapes into his mind of covered pits unfathomably deep a dire descent beyond the power of frost of faithless boggs of precipices huge smoothed up with snow and what is land unknown what water of the still unfrozen eye in the loose marsh or solitary lake where the fresh fountain from the bottom boils these check his fearful steps and down he sinks beneath the shelter of the shapeless drift thinking over all the bitterness of death mixed with the tender anguish nature shoots through the wrung bosom of the dying man his wife his children and his friends unseen in vain for him the officious wife prepares the fire fairblazing and the vestment warm in vain his little children peeping out into the mingling rack demand their sire with tears of artless innocence alas nor wife nor children more shall he behold nor friends nor sacred home on every nerve the deadly winter seizes shuts up sense and over his stronger vitals creeping cold lays him along the snows a stiffend corse unstretchd and bleaching in the northern blast ah little think the gay licentious proud whom pleasure power and affluence surround they who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth and wanton often cruel riot waste ah little think they while they dance along how many feel this very moment death and all the sad variety of pain how many sink in the devouring flood or more devouring flame how many bleed by shameful variance betwixt man and man how many pine in want and dungeon glooms shut from the common air and common use of their own limbs how many drink the cup of baleful grief or eat the bitter bread of misery sore pierced by wintry winds how many shrink into the fordid hut of chearless poverty how many shake with all the fiercer tortures of the mind unbounded passion madness guilt remorse whence tumbled headlong from the height of life they furnish matter for the tragic muse even in the vale where wisdom loves to dwell with friendship peace and contemplation joined how many rackt with honest passions droop in deep retired distress how many stand around the deathbed of their dearest friends like wailing pensive ghosts awaiting theirs and point the parting pang thought but fond man of these and all the thousand nameless ills that one incessant struggle render life one scene of toil of anguish and of fate vice in his high career would stand appalled and heedless rambling impulse learn to think the conscious heart of charity would warm and his wide wish benevolence dilate the social tear would rise the social sigh and into clear perfection gradual bliss refining still the social passions work and here can i forget the generous few who touched with human woe redressive sought into the horrors of the gloomy jail unpitied and unheard where misery moans where sickness pines where thirst and hunger burn and poor misfortune feels the lash of vice while in the land of liberty the land whose every street and public meeting glows with open freedom little tyrants raged snatched the lean morsel from the starving mouth tore from cold wintry limbs the tattered robe even robbed them of the last of comforts sleep the freeborn briton to the dungeon chained or as the lust of cruelty prevailed at pleasure marked him with inglorious stripes and crushed out lives by various nameless ways that for their country would have toiled or bled hail patriotband who scorning secret scorn when justice and when mercy led the way dragged the detected monsters into light wrenchd from their hand oppressions iron rod and bade the cruel feel the pains they gave yet stop not here let all the land rejoice and make the blessing unconfined as great much still untouched remains in this rank age much is the patriots weeding hand required the toils of law what dark insidious men have cumbrous added to perplex the truth and lengthen simple justice into trade oh glorious were the day that saw these broke and every man within the reach of right yet more outrageous is the season still a deeper horror in siberian wilds where winter keeps his unrejoicing court and in his airy hall the loud misrule of driving tempest is for ever heard there through the ragged woods absorpt in snow sole tenant of these shades the shaggy bear with dangling ice all horrid stalks forlorn slowpaced and sourer as the storms increase he makes his bed beneath the drifted snow and scorning the complainings of distress hardens his heart against assailing want while tempted vigorous over the marble waste on sleds reclined the furry russian sits and by his raindeer drawn behind him throws a shining kingdom in a winters day or from the cloudy alps and appenine capt with gray mists and everlasting snows where nature in stupendous rain lies and from the leaning rock on either side gush out those streams that classic song renowns cruel as death and hungry as the grave burning for blood bony and ghaunt and grim assembling wolves in torrent troops descend and pouring over the country bear along keen as the north wind sweeps the glossy snow all is their prize they fasten on the steed press him to earth and pierce his mighty heart nor can the bull his awful front defend or shake the murdering savages away rapacious at the mothers throat they fly and tear the screaming infant from her breast the godlike face of man avails him naught even beauty force divine at whose bright glance the generous lion stands in softened gaze here bleeds a hapless undistinguished prey but if apprizd of the severe attack the country be shut up lured by the scent on churchyards drear inhuman to relate the disappointed prowlers fall and dig the shrouded body from the tomb over which mixed with foul shades and frighted ghosts they howl now all amid the rigours of the year in the wild depth of winter while without the ceaseless winds blow ice be my retreat between the groaning forest and the shore beat by a boundless multitude of waves a rural sheltered solitary scene where ruddy fire and beaming tapers join to chase the cheerless gloom there let me sit and hold high converse with the mighty dead sages of ancient time as gods revered as gods beneficent who blessed mankind with arts and arms and humanizd a world roused at the inspiring thought i throw aside the longlived volume and deepmusing hail the sacred shades that slowlyrising pass before my wondering eyes  first socrates whose simple question to the folded heart stole unperceived and from the maze of thought evolvd the secret truth  a godlike man solon the next who built his commonweal on equitys wide base lycurgus then severely good and him of rugged rome numa who softened her rapacious sons cimon sweetsould and aristides just with that attemperd timoleon hero mild and firm who wept the brother while the tyrant bled unconquered cato virtuous in extreme scipio the human warrior gently brave who soon the race of spotless glory ran and warm in youth to the potic shade with friendship and philosophy retired and equal to the best the pelopidas and epaminondas theban twain who single raised their country into fame thousands behind the boast of greece and rome whom virtue owns the tribute of a verse demand but who can count the stars of heaven who sing their influence on this lower world but see who yonder comes in sober state fair mild and strong as is a vernal sun it is phoebus self or else the mantuan swain great homer too appears of daring wing parent of song and equal by his side the british muse joined hand in hand they walk darkling full up the middle steep to fame nor absent are those tuneful shades i ween taught by the graces whose enchanting touch shakes every passion from the various string nor those who solemnize the moral scene first of your kind society divine still visit thus my nights for you reserved and mount my soaring soul to deeds like yours silence thou lonely power the door be thine see on the hallowed hour that none intrude save lycidas the friend with sense refined learning digested well exalted faith unstudyd wit and humor ever gay or from the muses hill will pope descend to raise the sacred hour to make it smile and with the social spirit warm the heart for though not sweeter his own homer sings yet is his life the more endearing song thus in some deep retirement would i pass the winterglooms with friends of various turn or blithe or solemn as the theme inspired with them would search if this unbounded frame of nature rose from unproductive night or sprung eternal from the eternal cause its springs its laws its progress and its end hence larger prospects of the beauteous whole would gradual open on our opening minds and each diffufive harmony unite in full perfection to the astonished eye thence would we plunge into the moral world which though more seemingly perplexed moves on in higher order fitted and impelled by wisdoms finest hand and issuing all in universal good historic truth should next conduct through the deeps of time point us how empire grew revolved and fell in scattered states what makes the nations smile improves their soil and gives them double suns and why they pine beneath the brightest skies in natures richest lap as thus we talked our hearts would burn within us would inhale that portion of divinity that ray of purest heaven which lights the glorious flame of patriots and of heroes but if doomed in powerless humble fortune to repress these ardent risings of the kindling soul then even superior to ambition we would learn the private virtues how to glide through shades and plains along the smoothest stream of rural life or snatched away by hope through the dim spaces of futurity with earnest eye anticipate those scenes of happiness and wonder where the mind in endless growth and infinite ascent rises from state to state and world to world and when with these the serious soul is foiled we shifting for relief would play the shapes of frolic fancy and incessant form unnumberd pictures fleeting over the brain yet rapid still renewed and poured immense into the mind unbounded without space the great the new the beautiful or mixed burlesque and odd the risible and gay whence vivid wit and humor droll of face call laughter forth deepshaking every nerve meantime the village rouzes up the sire while well attested and as well believed heard solemn goes the goblinstory round till superstitious horror creeps over all or frequent in the sounding hall they wake the rural gambol rustic mirth goes round the simple joke that takes the shepherds heart easily pleased the long loud laugh sincere the kiss snatched hasty from the sidelong maid on purpose guardless or pretending sleep the leap the slap the haul and shook to notes of native music the respondent dance thus jocund fleets with them the winternight the city swarms intense the public haunt full of each theme and warm with mixed discourse hums indistinct the sons of riot flow down the loose stream of false enchanted joy to swift destruction on the rankled soul the gaming fury falls and in one gulf of total ruin honor virtue peace friends families and fortune headlong sink rises the dance along the lighted dome mixed and evolvd a thousand sprightly ways the glittering court effuses every pomp the circle deepens rained from radiant eyes a soft effulgence over the palace waves while thick as insects in the summershine the fop lightfluttering spreads his mealy wings dread over the scene the ghost of hamlet stalks othello rages poor monimia mourns and belvidera pours her soul in love assenting terror shakes the silent tear steals over the cheek or else the comic muse holds to the world the picture of itself and raises sly the fair impartial laugh clear frost succeeds and through the blue serene for sight too fine the ethereal nitre flies killing infectious damps and the spent air storing afresh with elemental life close crowds the shining atmosphere and binds our strengthened bodies in its cold embrace constringent feeds and animates our blood refines our spirits through the newstrung nerves in swifter fallies darting to the brain where sits the soul intense collected cool bright as the skies and as the season keen all nature feels the renovating force of winter only to the thoughtless eye in desolation seen the vacant glebe draws in abundant vegetable soul  athers vigor for the coming year a strong glow sits on the lively cheek of ruddy fire and luculent along the purer rivers flow their sullen deeps amazing open to the shepherds gaze and murmur hoarser at the fixing frost what art thou frost and whence are thy keen stores derived thou secret allinvading power whom even the illusive fluid cannot fly is not thy potent energy unseen myriads of little salts or hooked or shaped like double wedges and diffused immense through water earth and either hence at eve steamd eager from the red horizon round with the still rage of winter deep suffusd an icy gale often shifting over the pool breathes a blue film and in its mid career arrests the bickering stream the loosened ice let down the flood and halfdissolvd by day rustles no more but to the sedgy bank fast grows or gathers round the pointed stone a crystal pavement by the breath of heaven cemented firm till seized from shore to shore the whole detruded river growls below loud rings the frozen earth and hard reflects a double noise while at his evening watch the villagedog deters the nightly thief the heifer lows the distant waterfall swells in the breeze and with the hasty tread of traveller the many sounding plain shakes from afar the full ethereal round infinite worlds disclosing to the view shines out intensely keen and all one cope of starry glitter glows from pole to pole from pole to pole the rigid influence falls through the still night incessant heavy strong and seizes nature fast it freezes on till morn late rising over the drooping world lifts her pale eye unjoyous then appears the various labor of the silent night prone from the dripping eave and dumb cascade whose idle torrents only seem to roar the pendant isicle the frostwork fair where transient hues and fancied figures rise the liquid kingdom all to solid turned widespouted over the brow the frozen brook a livid tract cold gleaming on the morn the forest bent beneath the plumy wave and by the frost refined the whiter snow

youthful swains while every work of man is laid at rest fond over the river rush and shuddering view the doubtful deeps below or where the lake and long canal the cerule plain extend the city pours her thousands swarming all from every quarter and with him who slides or skating sweeps swift as the winds along in circling poise or else disordered falls his feet illuded sprawling to the sky while the laugh rages round from end to end increasing still resounds the crowded scene pure quick and sportful is the wholesome day but soon elapsed the horizontal sun broad over the south hangs at his utmost noon and ineffectual strikes the gelid cliff the mountain still his azure gloss maintains nor feels the feeble touch perhaps the vale relents a while to the reflected ray or from the forest falls the clustered snow myriads of gem that by the breeze diffused gaytwinkle through the gleam heard thick around thunders the sport of those who with the gun and dog impatient bounding at the shot worse than the season desolate the fields and adding to the ruins of the year distress the footed or the feathered game but what is this these infant tempests what the mockery of winter should our eye astonished shoot into the frozen zone where more than half the joyless year is night and failing gradual life at last goes out there undissolving from the first of time snows swell on snows amazing to the sky and icy mountains there on mountains pild seem to the shivering sailor from afar shapeless and white an atmosphere of clouds projected huge and horrid over the main alps frown on alps or rushing hideous down as if old chaos was again returned shake the firm pole and make an ocean boil whence heaped abrupt along the howling shore and into various shapes as fancy leans worked by the wave the crystal pillars heave swells the blue portico the gothic dome shoots fretted up and birds and beasts and men rise into mimic life and sink by turns the restless deep itself cannot resist the binding fury but in all its rage of tempest taken by the boundless frost is many a fathom to the bottom chained and bid to roar no more a bleak expanse shaggd over with wavy rocks chearless and void of every life that from the dreary months flies conscious southward miserable they who here entangled in the gathering ice take their last look of the descending sun while full of death and fierce with tenfold frost the long long night incumbent over their head falls horrible such was the sir hugh willoughby sent by queen elizabeth to discover the northeast passage britons fate as with first prow what have not britons dared he for the passage sought attempted since so much in vain and seeming to be shut by jealous nature with eternal bars in these fell regions in arzina caught and to the stony deep his idle ship immediate sealed he with his hapless crew each full exerted at his several task froze into statues to the cordage glued the sailor and the pilot to the helm hard by these shores the last of mankind live and scarce enlivened by the distant sun that rears and ripens man as well as plants here human nature just begins to dawn deep from the piercing season sunk in caves here by dull fires and with unjoyous cheer they wear the tedious gloom immersed in furs lie the gross race nor sprightly jest nor song nor tenderness they know nor ought of life beyond the kindred ears that stalk without till longexpected morning looks at length faint on their fields where winter reigns alone and calls the quiverd savage to the chase muttering the winds at eve with hoarser voice blow blustering from the south the frost subdued gradual resolves into a trickling thaw spotted the mountains shine loose sleet descends and floods the country round the rivers swell impatient for the day broke from the hills over rocks and woods in broad brown cataracts a thousand snowfed torrents shoot at once and where they rush the wideresounding plain is left one slimy waste those sullen seas that wash the ungenial pole will rest no more beneath the shackles of the mighty north but rousing all their waves resistless heave  and hark the lengthening roar continuous runs athwart the rifted main at once it bursts and piles a thousand mountains to the clouds ill fares the bark the wretchs last resort that lost amid the floating fragments moors beneath the shelter of an icy isle while night oerwhelms the sea and horror looks more horrible can human force endure the assembled mischiefs that besiege them round heartgnawing hunger fainting weariness the roar of winds and waves the crush of ice now ceasing now renewed with louder rage and in dire echoes bellowing round the main more to embroil the deep leviathan and his unwieldy train in horrid sport tempest the loosened brine while through the gloom far from the bleak inhospitable shore loading the winds is heard the hungry howl of famished monsters there awaiting wrecks yet providence that everwaking eye looks down with pity on the fruitless toil of mortals lost to hope and lights them safe through all this dreary labyrinth of fate it is done  dread winter has subdued the year and reigns tremendous over the desert plains how dead the vegetable kingdom lies how dumb the tuneful horror wide extends his solitary empire here fond man behold thy pictured life pass some few years thy flowering spring thy summers ardent strength thy sober antumn fading into age and pale concluding winter comes at last and shuts the scene ah whither now are fled those dreams of greatness those unsolid hopes of happiness

refined clears up apace ye vainly wise ye blind presuming now confounded in the dust adore that power and wisdom often arraigned see now the cause why unassuming worth in secret lived and died neglected why the good mans share in life was gall and bitterness of soul why the lone widow and her orphans pined in starving solitude while luxury in palaces lay prompting his low thought to form unreal wants why heavenborn truth and moderation fair wore the red marks of superstitions scourge why licensed pain that cruel spoiler that embosomd foe embittered all our bliss ye good distressed ye noble few who here unbending stand beneath lifes pressure yet a little while and what you reckon evil is no more the storms of wintry time will quickly pass and one unbounded spring encircle all the

gales a yellowfloating pomp thy bounty shines in autumn unconfined thrown from thy lap profuse over nature falls the lucid shower of beamy fruits and in a radiant stream into the stores of steril winter pours in winter dreadful thou with clouds and storms around thee thrown tempest over tempest rolled horrible blackness on the whirlwinds wing riding sublime thou bidst the world be low and humblest nature with thy northern blast mysterious round what skill what force divine deepfelt in these appear a simple train yet so harmonious mixed so fitly joined one following one in such enchanting sort shade unperceived so softening into shade and all so forming such a perfect whole that as they still succeed they ravish still but wondering often with brute unconscious gaze man marks thee not marks not the mighty hand that everbusy wheels the silent spheres works in the secret deep shoots steaming thence the fair profusion that oerspreads the spring flings from the sun direct the flaming day feeds every creature hurls the tempest forth and as on earth this grateful change revolves with transport touches all the springs of life nature attend join every living soul beneath the spacious temple of the sky in adoration join and ardent raise an universal hymn to him ye gales breathe soft whose spirit teaches you to breathe oh talk of him in solitary glooms where over the rock the scarcelywaving pine fills the brown void with a religious awe and ye whose bolder note is heard afar who shake the astonished world lift high to heaven the impetuous song and say from whom you rage his praise ye brooks attune ye trembling rills and let me catch it as i muse along ye headlong torrents rapid and profound ye softer floods that lead the humid maze along the vale and thou majestic main a secret world of wonders in thyself sound his tremendous praise whose greater voice or bids you roar or bids your roarings fall roll up your incense herbs and fruits and flowers in mingled clouds to him whose sun elates whose hand perfumes you and whose pencil paints ye forests bend ye harvests wave to him breathe your still song into the reapers heart homeward rejoicing with the joyous moon ye that keep watch in heaven as earth asleep unconscious lies effuse your mildest beams ye constellations while your angles strike amid the spangled sky the silver lyre great source of

world asleep sweetest of birds sweet philomela charm the listening shades and through the midnight hour trilling prolong the wildlyluscious note that night as well as day may vouch his praise ye chief

grove there let the shepherds flute the virgins chaunt the prompting seraph and the poets lyre still sing the god of seasons as they roll for me when i forget the darling theme whether the blossom blows the summerray russets the plain delicious autumn gleams or winter rises in the reddening east be my tongue mute may fancy paint no more and dead to joy forget my heart to beat should fate command me to the farthest verge of the green earth to hostile barbarous climes rivers unknown to song where first the sun gilds indian mountains or his setting beam flames on the atlantic isles it is naught to me since god is ever present ever felt in the void waste as in the city full rolls the same kindred seasons round the world in all apparent wise and good in all since he sustains and

mind attend and with heroic patience years on years deepsearching saw at last the system dawn and shine of all his race on him alone what were his raptures then how pure how strong and what the triumphs of old greece and rome by his diminished but the price of boys in some small fray victorious when instead of shattered parcels of this earth usurped by violence unmanly and sore deeds of cruelty and blood nature herself stood all subdued by him and open laid her every latent glory to his view all intellectual eye our solar round first gazing through he by the blended power of

actuates the whole say ye who best can tell ye happy few who saw him in the softest lights of life all unwithheld indulging to his friends the vast unborrowd treasures of his mind oh speak the wondrous man how mild how calm how greatly humble how divinely good how firm established on eternal truth fervent in doing well with every nerve still pressing on forgetful of the past and panting for perfection far above those little cares and visionary joys that so perplex the fond impassioned heart of evercheated evertrusting man this conduit from thy rural hours we hope as through the pleasing shade where nature pours her every sweet in studious ease you walk the social passions smiling at thy heart that glows with all the recollected sage and you ye hopeless gloomyminded tribe you who unconscious of those nobler flights that reach impatient at immortal life against the prime endearing pivilege of being dare contend say can a soul of such extensive deep tremendous powers enlarging still be but a finer breath of spirits dancing through their tubes awhile and then for ever lost in vacant air but hark methinks i hear a warning voice solemn as when some awful change is come sound through the world   it is done  the measures full  and i resign my charge  ye mouldering stones that build the towering pyramid the proud triumphal arch the monument effaced by ruthless ruin and whatever supports the worshipped name of hoar antiquity down to the dust what grandeur can ye boast while newton lifts his column to the skies beyond the waste of time  let no weak drop be shed for him the virgin in her bloom cut off the joyous youth and darling child these are the tombs that claim the tender tear and elegiac song but newton calls for other notes of gratulation high that now he wanders through those endless worlds he here so well descried and wondering talks and hymns their author with his glad compeers o britains boast whether with angels thou sit in dread discourse or fellowblest who joy to see the honor of their kind or whether mounted on cherubic wing thy swift career is with the whirling orbs comparing things with things in rapture lost and grateful adoration for that light so plenteous rayd into thy mind below from light himself oh look with pity down on humankind a frail erroneous race exalt the spirit of a downward world over thy dejected country chief preside and be her genius called her studies raise correct her manners and inspire her youth for though depraved and sunk she brought thee forth and glories in thy name she points thee out to all her sons and bids them eye thy star while in expectance of the second life when time shall be no more thy sacred dust sleeps with her kings and dignifies the scene the end britannia a poem written in the year       et tantas audetis tollere moles quos ego  sed motos praestat componere fluctus post mihi non simili poena commissa luetis maturate fugam regique haec dicite vestro non illi imperium pelagi saevumque tridentem sed mihi sort datum  virg britannia a poem as on the seabeat shore britannia sat of her degenerate sons the faded fame deep in her anxious heart revolving sad bare was her throbbing bosom to the gale that hoarse and hollow from the bleak surge blew loose flowed her tresses rent her azure robe hung over the deep from her majestic brow she tore the laurel and she tore the bay nor ceased the copious grief to bathe her cheek nor ceased her sobs to murmur to the main peace discontented nigh departing stretched her dovelike wings and war though greatly roused yet mourned his fettered hands while thus the queen of nations spoke and what she said the muse recorded faithful in unbidden verse even not yon sail that from the skymixt wave dawns on the sight and wafts the royal youth a freight of future glory to my shore even not the flattering view of golden days and rising periods yet of bright renown beneath the parents and their endless line through late revolving time can sooth my rage while unchastisd the insulting spaniard dares infest the trading flood full of vain war despise my navies and my merchants seize as trusting to false peace they fearless roam the world of waters wild made by the toil and liberal blood of glorious ages mine nor bursts my sleeping thunder on their head whence this unwonted patience this weak doubt this tame beseeching of rejected peace this meek forbearance this unnative fear to generous britons never known before and failed my fleets for this on indian tides to float unactive with the veering winds the mockery of war while hot disease and sloth distempered swept off burning crowds for action ardent and amid the deep inglorious sunk them in a watery grave there now they lie beneath the rolling flood far from their friends and country unavengd and back the weeping warship comes again dispirited and thin her sons ashamed thus idly to review their native shore with not one glory sparkling in their eye one triumph on their tongue a passenger the violated merchant comes along that farsought wealth for which the noxious gale he drew and sweat beneath equator suns by lawless force detained a force that soon would melt away and every spoil resign were once the british lion heard to roar whence is it that the proud iberian thus in their own wellasserted element dares rouse to wrath the masters of the main who told him that the big incumbent war would not ere this have rolled his trembling ports in smoaky ruin and his guilty stores won by the ravage of a butchered world yet unattond sunk in the swallowing deep or led the glittering prize into the thames there was a time oh let my languid sons resume their spirit at the rouzing thought when all the pride of spain in one dread fleet swelled over the laboring surge like a whole heaven of clouds widerolld before the boundless breeze gaily the splendid armament along exultant ploughd reflecting a red gleam as sunk the sun over all the flaming vast tall gorgeous and elate drunk with the dream of easy conquest while their bloated war stretched out from sky to sky the gathered force of ages held in its capacious womb but soon regardless of the cumbrous pomp my dauntless britons came a gloomy few with tempest black the goodly scene deformed and laid their glory waste the bolts of fate resistless thundered through their yielding sides fierce over their beauty blazed the lurid flame and seized in horrid grasp or shattered wide amid the mighty waters deep they sunk then too from every promontory chill rank fen and cavern where the wild wave works i swept confederate winds and swelled a storm round the glad isle snatched by the vengeful blast the scattered remnants drove on the blind shelve and pointed rock that marks the indented shore relentless dashed where loud the northern main howls through the fracturd caledonian isles such were the dawnings of my liquid reign but since how vast it grew how absolute even in those troubled times when dreadful blake awed angry nations with the british name let every humbled state let europe say sustained and balanced by my naval arm ah what must these immortal spirits think of your poor shifts these for their countrys good who faced the blackest danger knew no fear no mean submission but commanded peace ah how with indignation must they burn if ought but joy can touch etherial breasts with shame with grief to see their feeble sons shrink from that empire over the conquered feas for which their wisdom pland their councils glowed and their veins bled through many a toiling age oh first of human blessings and supreme fair peace how lovely how delightful thou by whose wide tie the kindred sons of men like brothers live in amity combined and unsuspicious faith while honest toil gives every joy and to those joys a right which idle barbarous rapine but usurps pure is thy reign when unaccursd by blood naught save the sweetness of indulgent showers trickling distills into the vernant glebe instead of mangled carcasses sadseen when the blythe sheaves lie scattered over the field when only shining shares the crooked knife and hooks imprint the vegetable wound when the land blushes with the rose alone the falling fruitage and the bleeding vine oh peace thou source and soul of social life beneath whose calm inspiring influence science his views enlarges art refines and swelling commerce opens all her ports blessed be the man divine who gives us thee who bids the trumpet hush his horrid clang nor blow the giddy nations into rage who sheaths the murderous blade the deadly gun into the wellpild armory returns and every vigor from the work of death to grateful industry converting makes the country flourish and the city smile unviolated him the virgin sings and him the smiling mother to her train of him the shepherd in the peaceful dale chaunts and the treasures of his labor sure the husbandman of him as at the plough or team he toils with him the sailor sooths beneath the trembling moon the midnight wave and the full city warm from street to street and shop to shop responsive rings of him nor joys one land alone his praise extends far as the sun rolls the diffusive day far as the breeze can bare the gifts of peace till all the happy nations catch the song what would not peace the patriot bear for thee what painful patience what incessant care what mixed anxiety what sleepless toil even from the rash protected what reproach for he thy value knows thy friendship he to human nature but the better thou the richer of delight sometimes the more inevitable war when russian force awakes the fury of an injured state then the good easy man whom reason rules who while unhurt knew nor offense nor harm roused by bold insult and injurious rage with sharp and sudden check the astonished sons of violence confounds firm as his cause his bolder heart in awful justice clad his eyes effulging a peculiar fire and as he charges through the prostrate war his keen arm teaches faithless men no more to dare the sacred vengeance of the just and what my thoughtless sons should fire you more than when your weilearnd empire of the deep the least beginning injury receives what better cause can call your lightning forth your thunder wake your dearest life demand what better cause than when your country sees the sly destruction at her vitals aimed for oh it much imports you it is your all to keep your trade entire entire the force and honor of your fleets over that to watch even with a hand severe and jealous eye in intercourse be gentle generous just by wisdom polished and of manners fair but on the sea be terrible untamed unconquerable still let none escape who shall but aim to touch your glory there is there the man into the lyons den who dares intrude to snatch his young away and is a briton seized and seized beneath the slumbring terrors of a british fleet then ardent rise oh great in vengeance rise oerturn the proud teach rapine to restore and as you ride sublimely round the world make every vessel stoop make every state at once their welfare and their duty know this is your glory this your wisdom this the native power for which you were designed by fate when fate designed the firmest state that ever was seated on the subject sea a state alone where liberty should live in these late times this evening of mankind when athens rome and carthage are no more the world almost in slavish sloth dissolved for this these rocks around your coast were thrown for this your oaks peculiar hardened shoot strong into sturdy growth for this your hearts swell with a sullen courage growing still as danger grows and strength and toil for this are liberal poured over all the fervent land then cherish this this unexpensive power undangerous to the public ever prompt by lavish nature thrust into your hand and unencumberd with the bulk immense of conquest whence huge empires rose and fell selfcrushd extend your reign from shore to shore wherever the wind your high behests can blow and fix it deep on this eternal base for should the sliding fabrrick once give way soon slackened quite and past recovery broke it gathers ruin as it rolls along steeprushing down to that devouring gulf where many a mighty empire buried lies and should the big redundant flood of trade in which ten thousand thousand labors join their several currents till the boundless tide rolls in a radiant deluge over the land should this bright stream the least inflected point its course another way over other lands the various treasure would resistless pour never to be won again its ancient tract left a vile channel desolate and dead with all around a miserable waste not egypt were her better heaven the nile turned in the pride of flow when over his rocks and roaring cataracts beyond the reach of dizzy vision pild in one wide flash an ethiopian deluge foams amain whence wondering fable traced him from the sky even not that prime of earth where harvests crowd on untilled harvests all the teeming year if of the fat overflowing culture robbed were then a more uncomfortable wild steril and void than of her trade deprived britons your boasted isle her princes sunk her highbuilt honor moulderd to the dust unnervd her force her spirit vanished quite with rapid wing her riches fled away her unfrequented ports alone the sign of what she was her merchants scattered wide her hollow shops shut up and in her streets her fields woods markets villages and roads the cheerful voice of labor heard no more oh let not then waste luxury impair that manly soul of toil which strings your nerves and your own proper happiness creates oh let not the soft penetrating plague creep on the freeborn mind and working there with the sharp tooth of many a newformd want endless and idle all eat out the heart of liberty the high conception blast the noble sentiment the impatient scorn of base subjection and the swelling wish for general good erazing from the mind while naught save narrow selfishness succeeds and low design the sneaking passions all let loose and reigning in the rankled breast induced at last by scarceperceivd degrees sapping the very frame of government and life a total dissolution comes sloth ignorance dejection flattery fear oppression raging over the waste he makes the human being almost quite extinct and the whole state in broad corruption sinks oh shun that gulf that gaping ruin shun and countless ages roll it far away from you ye heavenbelovd may liberty the light of life the sun of human kind whence heroes bards and patriots borrow flame even where the keen depressive north descends still spread exalt and actuate your powers while slavish southern climates beam in vain and may a public spirit from the throne where every virtue sits go copious forth live over the land the finer arts inspire make thoughtful science raise his pensive head blow the fresh bay bid industry rejoice and the rough sons of lowest labor smile as when profuse of spring the loosened west lifts up the pining year and balmy breathes youth life and love and beauty over the world but haste we from these melancholy shores nor to deaf winds and waves our fruitless plaint pour weak the country claims our active aid that let us roam and where we find a spark of public virtue blow it into flame and now my sons the sons of freedom meet in awful senate thither let us fly burn in the patriots thought flow from his tongue in fearless truth myself transformed preside and shed the spirit of britannia round this said
