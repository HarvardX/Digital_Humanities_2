for t davies in russel street covent garden and t cadell in the strand mdcclxxi  the history of lady barton letter xxxi lady barton to miss cleveland southfield my story is already prefaced so i need but proceed repeating as before after mrs walter  for the first ten or twelve days that i passed at paris the novelty of the scene with the grandeur and brilliancy of the objects that surrounded me lifted me as it were out of myself and helped me for that time almost to forget my misfortunes the marchioness made me several very considerable presents and ordered her trades people to attend me that i might choose my own clothes only desiring they might be handsome enough to appear in along with her  madame de fribourg received a vast deal of company and kept very late hours monsieur de lovaine was seldom of her parties and sometimes withdrew himself entirely from the house for a fortnight together she used to appear dissatisfied at his absence and frequently complained to me of the coldness and constraint of his manners toward her  he used sometimes to visit me in my apartment seemed fond of my little olivia and often wished that he had such another child  he said the marchionesss mode of living was by much too gay and dissipated for him and that he languished for the pleasures of society in a more rational course of life  small as was my knowledge of the world i could not help perceiving that there was something particular in monsieur de lovaines address whenever he spoke to me but this circumstance however was not of a nature to give offense as it amounted to nothing more than an additional softness in his looks and voice  the marchioness certainly perceived it as well as i and would often fix her piercing eyes upon me and ask me if colonel walter was as handsome as monsieur de lovaine i always replied as i really thought that the colonel was by far the handsomest man i had ever seen  she used to appear pleased with what she called my simplicity  at other times her manners were severe toward me and though perfectly convinced of my own innocence i began soon to fear that i was become the object of her jealousy  this idea was productive of the most fatal consequences to my peace it rendered my behavior timid and constrained before her and totally deprived me of that ease and cheerfulness which i had before endeavored to assume in hopes of rendering myself agreeable to my kind benefactress  this alteration in me which her own manners had occasioned she construed into the effect of guilt and became every day more cold and reserved toward me scarce ever asked me to go out with her and as often affected to be surprised when she saw me come into her drawing room  though my situation with the marchioness was by no means the ne plus ultra of my hopes and wishes which continually pressed forward to the meeting of olivias father my still loved cruel husband yet certainly i had reason to consider it as an happy asylum for my child and me her bounty had rescued both of us from the iron hand of poverty and placed us in the lap of plenty of honor and of ease how then could i bear the being suspected of repaying such benefits with the basest sort of ingratitude it was impossible i determined therefore to come to an explanation with the marchioness if possible to convince her of my innocence and do all in my power to recover her esteem but if i failed of removing her suspicions i firmly resolved to quit her directly to throw myself and my infant once more into a merciless world to labor for our bread and suffer any misery that poverty could afflict me with rather than that of embittering her life to whom i owed the generous support of my own  i had revolved this subject in my thoughts for several days and impatiently waited for an opportunity of executing my scheme but the distance and hauteur of madame de fribourgs manner overawed me still i found i could not muster up spirit sufficient to speak to her on such an interesting topic and i resolved therefore to communicate my sentiments to her in writing  one evening that she went to the italian comedy i retired to my chamber in order to execute my purpose and that i might not be interrupted i desired the maid who attended olivia to take her down stairs and amuse her till i should ring for her to come up as i had some letters of consequence to write  she withdrew i bolted my chamber door sat down to the task i had assigned myself  i found it infinitely more difficult than i had imagined i wrote and burned several sheets of paper and blotted others with my tears  in this situation i heard a key turn as it were behind the arras and saw monsieur de lovaine entering by a door which had been till then concealed from me i started up when he threw himself instantly at my feet said he had long waited in vain for the opportunity of finding me alone for a moment and hoped i would pardon his acquainting me perhaps a little too abruptly with a secret on which more than his life his happiness depended  to be short he then declared his love for me with all the asseverations protestations and transports that the most violent passion could suggest  no words can paint the surprise and confusion of my mind which i thought it was impossible to augment till i saw the marchioness come in at the door which monsieur de lovaine had left open and find him on his knees before me luckily for me i was saved from distraction by the total suspension of all my faculties and i sunk motionless in my chair  many hours passed before my reason returned  my recollection of the events that had happened on the preceding night was such as one feels on awaking from a painful dream yet i flattered myself i should still be able to undeceive the marchioness by the most solemn assurances of my innocence and though i could never hope to regain her favor justice methought ought to have restored me to the place i had before obtained in her esteem  alas i knew not then that jealousy like the adder is at once sharpsighted deaf and venomous  i rose as soon as it was day and upon inquiring for the papers which i left upon my table was informed that the marchioness had taken them away  i waited impatiently for her rising i was determined to throw myself at her feet the moment i should be permitted to see her to acquaint her with every sentiment of my heart and to set hers at ease on my account by withdrawing myself from here is and monsieur de lovaines sight for ever  while i was ruminating on my unhappy situation a servant brought me the following letter  a madame dolivet after the scene i was last night an accidental witness of you cannot i suppose be weak enough to imagine that it is any longer in your power to impose upon me or that all your art consummate as it is can prevail on me to continue my protection to the most ungrateful of her sex your deeplaid scheme of deceiving me by that letter which you and my unworthy husband had concerted together cannot now take effect contempt must follow such a detection and render you as much below my resentment as you ever were beneath my esteem  in regard to myself i must inform you that though i have long suspected an improper intercourse between monsieur de lovaine and you i was not actuated by so mean a motive as seeking the conviction i met with when i entered your apartment  impelled by the regard i once had for you i was impatient to acquaint you with what i then imagined might have been a welcome piece of intelligence by informing you that the person you call your husband is in paris and that i had seen him at the comedy  it did not at that moment occur to me how unwelcome both the news and the messenger might be to you  on inquiring for you when i came home i was told that you had bolted your door and given orders not to be disturbed even by your darling child i knew not but you might be ill or gone to bed and therefore to avoid alarming you thought of the private door which your lover had been so careless as to leave open behind him  i do not mean this detail as an apology to you but as a justification to myself  i have nothing farther to add because i must suppose it unnecessary to command you to quit my house your new protector will i doubt not furnish you with proper accommodation and from this moment i am determined never to hear see speak or if possible think of you more  mariana de fribourg   i sat down on the instant and wrote to the marchioness and in the strongest and most affecting terms implored her to admit me to her presence for a few minutes  but in vain she returned my letter unopened with a message by her woman that she would never read a line that i should write or ever suffer me into her presence more  i grew almost distracted at this treatment and tried to force my way into her apartment but was prevented from entering by her servants and treated like what i really then was a poor frantic wretch  the consciousness of my integrity might possibly have supported my spirits at any other time but the terrors i felt lest the marchioness should see my husband before i did and poison his mind with her unjust suspicions were not to be endured  my situation was as completely miserable as any thing but guilt could possibly have rendered it  while i labored under these agonizing sensations monsieur de lovaine entered my apartment  the moment i beheld him rage for the first time of my life became the predominant passion of my soul i accused him as the author of all my wretchedness would not suffer him to speak though he was prostrate at my feet and commanded him to fly from my sight for ever  unwilling to irritate me farther he rose and retired and had there been an instrument of death within my reach i fear i might at that instant have put an end to a wretched being which saw itself marked out for destruction  i was at last informed by the marchionesss orders that a fiacre waited to carry me where i pleased  though i had been near ten months at paris i was as much a stranger in that great city as on the day i first arrived there i implored the servant who had attended olivia not to forsake me and to direct whither i should go and what course i should take she applied to her lady for leave to attend me but she had not humanity sufficient to grant her request  the girl had however resolution and compassion enough to disobey her commands and accompanied me to a small house in the suburbs of st germains that belonged to her sister  as soon as she had brought me there she returned again to the hotel de fribourg without my knowledge to pack up my clothes and her own  when she came back she gave me a pocket book which she said i had left behind me as soon as i saw it i knew it was not mine and desired she would find the owner and restore it  she opened it and a letter dropped out addressed to me  the hand appeared to be the marchionesss and it occurred to me that she might have so far relented as to acquaint me with what she knew of colonel walter  i instantly broke the seal and read as follows  a madame dolivet madam if as we are taught to believe penitence may atone for the greatest crimes the true sorrow and contrition which i feel for having rendered you unhappy entitles me to hope for your forgiveness  but though you should be generous enough to grant it it is impossible that i should ever forgive myself  do not be alarmed madam at the little artifice i have used in endeavoring to counterfeit the marchionesss hand i mean nothing more by it than to plead for pardon and to satisfy you that i shall never more attempt to disturb your peace  the moment i have sealed this i shall quit paris perhaps for ever  the sight of my tyrant is now become odious to me and i dare not flatter myself with the happiness of ever again beholding you i go then madam to indulge my unhappy passion in silence and retirement  i fly from the object of my hatred to the contemplation of her whom i adore of her to whom the warmest wishes of my heart shall for ever be devoted and to whom i shall for ever remain  a passionate but an honorable lover charles de lovaine ps i hear the happy possessor of your heart is now in paris may your virtues meet with their return from his kindness and may he if possible have as high a sense of them as the despairing  c l     enclosed in this letter there was a bank note for two hundred louis dors which i immediately sealed up with it and sent maria to deliver back into the hands of monsieur de lovaine but he had quitted the marchionesss house an hour before that time and no person could tell where he was gone to  the violent agitation of spirits i had gone through brought on a feverish complaint and though i had resolved to go alas i knew not where in pursuit of colonel walter i found myself unable to sit up and was obliged to submit to my disorder  i grew worse every hour and by the next morning i became delirious  the physician who attended me thought it was impossible that i should recover and at the end of six weeks my being able to crawl across the chamber was deemed a prodigy  the anxiety of my mind doubtless retarded my recovery my impatience to see colonel walter or at least to hear something of him increased every day and marias sister was sent to inquire for him at all the hotels and houses of english resort in paris but without ever receiving the least glimmering of light to trace him by  as soon as my strength would permit i was carried in a sedan to the luxemburg gardens maria attended that i might lean on her in case i should be able to walk  i was moving slowly on in one of the most retired walks when i heard colonel walters voice i turned quick to look for him and saw him coming toward me with another gentleman  but i saw no more my senses forsook me in spite of marias sustaining arm i fell motionless on the ground  the first emotions of humanity naturally brought both these persons to my assistance the colonel raised me in his arms and carried me to the next seat but the moment he beheld my face he started from me and cried out come away my lord and leave that abandoned woman to practice her arts on other men for here they cannot be successful  he then took hold of his companion dragged him off and quitted the gardens with the utmost precipitation  and though maria had sense enough to know that this must have been the person we had so long been in search of yet it was impossible for her to quit me in the situation i then was in order to pursue and watch his haunts  this last shock quite overcame my spirits i was conveyed home in a state of insensibility fell from one fainting fit into another and for several weeks my existence was marked only by the hourly expectation of my dissolution  yet was i at that time more anxious to live than i had ever been before i had seen my husband and hoped there was a possibility of seeing him again of clearing my innocence and at least of placing my beloved child under the protection of her father these were strong motives and they operated accordingly  i recovered to the amazement of every creature that knew me and again vainly renewed my search after my unkind fugitive  maria used sometimes to visit a favorite fellow servants at the marchionnesss who told her it was universally believed in the family that i had had an amor with monsieur de lovaine that he had entirely absented himself from his lady and that she seemed inclined to console herself for his loss by a particular intimacy with an english gentleman who made one in all her parties and was going with her in a few days to the waters of barege  the description she gave of his person exactly resembled conel walter and i was perfectly convinced that this new friend of the marchionesss was my still beloved deceived and unkind husband  i had no person to consult who was capable of advising me how i should act upon this occasion and amidst a variety of wild and romantic schemes i at last pitched on that of writing to him and requesting the favor of an interview in the character of a stranger i had no doubt that if he accepted my invitation nature would recover her rights in his heart and that the sight of a woman whom he had once fondly loved and cruelly deserted with the additional influence of his lovely child would melt his obdurate nature or at least soften it so far as to allow me to assert my innocence and endeavor to awaken the feelings of parental affection if every other species of tenderness were even totally extinguished  full of these fond ideas i wrote to him in an ambiguous style disguised my hand as much as possible and would not even venture to direct my letter lest the recollection of my writing which is rather particular should prevent his opening it  maria prevailed on her friend who lived at the marchionesss to deliver this billet to his servant and to desire that the answer might be left with her  every thing answered to my expectations and the morning following i received a very galant note assuring me that the person i had honored with my invitation would most gladly accept of the favor i intended him and have the happiness of waiting on me at eight oclock that evening  my poor foolish heart exulted with joy at the success of my little stratagem i dressed and undressed olivia an hundred times in order to try if i could add any ornament to her natural beauty and render her more lovely in her fathers eyes  as to myself i disdained the aid of dress well knowing that my wan complexion and my wasted form could only furnish him with such a reproachful idea as my ghost might have done of what i was when he forsook me  i counted the minutes quicker than they passed and thought them ages till the appointed hour arrived  but gracious heaven how shall i express the astonishment i felt when i saw an utter stranger enter the room with a mixture of libertinism and freedom in his looks and manners i let go olivias hand which i had held in mine gave a loud shriek and fainted  maria ran to my assistance the stranger gazed intently on me and said to her with a kind of sneer it was a pity that her lady was subject to such violent disorders but hoped she would recover her health before she made another assignation with him for he had seen her faint twice and he did not think fits were the least addition to female beauty  however as he believed she might be in distress he would make her a present of five guineas for the sake of an old friend of here is honest jack walter  and that when he came back from barege he would call upon her again in hopes of finding her in a more sociable state than she appeared to be at present  maria instantly recollected that this gentleman was with the colonel the day we met him in the luxemburg gardens and endeavored to convince him that he was not the person i expected to see he said that was impossible for he had my note in his pocket and had shown it to colonel walter who knew my writing perfectly well though i had attempted to disguise it  she tried every argument to make him take back his money but in vain and as he found that i did not immediately come to myself he quitted the house with strong expressions of dissatisfaction at his disappointment  this last stroke was infinitely more severe than all that i had yet endured i now saw the impossibility of ever clearing my conduct to my husband and devoted as i was by him to infamy the peaceful asylum of the sheltering grave was now become my only hope or wish even a mothers tenderness could not reconcile me to such unmerited and endless sufferings that virtuous fondness which had sustained me through all my former trials was now absorbed in mean selflove and i could not refrain from praying for an end of my misery though certain that my olivias misfortunes must commence from the conclusion of mine  i languished on for many months in this state of passive despair when the fight of the good father guillaume whom i had never heard from since i left marseilles and of course concluded to be dead brought back a gleam of joy  he told me that after his return to marseilles he had a long and severe illness and on his recovery had been obliged to go to rome on business that he had written to me several times and was grieved to find that his letters had miscarried  he informed me that nannette had died in about six weeks after i left her that she was extremely penitent for the injuries she had done me and retracted every thing she had said to my prejudice  i dropped tears at her untimely fate  while my own misery taught me to envy that lot which my humanity lamented  the marchioness had written to father guillaume and accused me of the basest ingratitude to her and the most infamous conduct with regard to myself and the good man had come on purpose to paris to be as he said convinced of my innocence or to relinquish his opinion of female virtue the situation he found me in afforded him sufficient conviction of my integrity and when i related the circumstances in which i had been involved the gracious drops of pity that he shed for my distress were like a healing balm to my poor wounded heart  he would have gone directly to the marchioness and tried to undeceive her but she had been at barege for some time and no one knew whether she would go from thence to paris or marseilles  he undertook to find out colonel walter for me if he remained in paris and cheared my spirits with the hope that he would at least vindicate my injured character and leave him no excuse for the inhumanity of his behavior  after a fruitless search of several weeks he learned that colonel walter was then at genoa  he wrote to him in the most forcible terms in my favor but to this and many other letters he never deigned an answer though we were satisfied that he had received them from the hand of a person that father guillaume could depend on who afterward informed us of the colonels setting out for england and of his design of returning to settle in his native country  as to myself i had now no hope left of ever recovering his esteem or my reputation  to my great joy i perceived i was going fast into a consumption but though i longed for my release it was impossible to quit my little charge exposed to all the miseries of unfriended youth without suffering the severest agonies and after many consultations upon the subject i at last acquiesced in father guillaumes opinion that it was my duty not to leave her totally an orphan but to place her and myself under the protection of her father before i should be taken from her  upon this principle i set out for ireland as soon as i had received information through father guillaumes means of my husbands being there i arrived about four months ago my reception surpassed even my apprehensions inhumanity and insult were added to unkindness and my not being turned out to perish in the highway was accounted a favor far beyond my desert  what account the colonel gave of me to his servants i can only suppose but he told me that if ever i attempted to converse with one of them i should not remain another moment in his house he commanded me never again to appear in his sight and confined me to a wretched garret where i am supplied with such food as his servants think proper to afford me  unworthy as i am i have often repined at the continuance of my existence but i now bless the chastening hand that has enabled me to support my miseries to this auspicious hour when i can no longer doubt that my child shall find protection from your humanity and no more be involved in the unhappy fate that has so long attended her truly wretched mother  the agonies which mrs walter sustained during the recital of her affecting story made me fear that her death would bring it to a period before she had finished the relation  but my appearing as i really was sincerely interested in her misfortunes seemed to furnish her with such a recruit of strength and spirits as enabled her to undergo the reflection and recital of her unmerited sorrows  the morning was pretty far advanced by the time mrs walter had concluded her narrative i gave her the strongest assurances of my doing every thing in my power both for herself and her child  i pressed her to take share of my bed for a few hours which she refused though she seemed so faint and exhausted as to be scarce able to get up stairs she said if olivia should awaken and miss her she would be alarmed and might disturb the family she added that one of her greatest anxieties for some time past had been for what her child should feel if she should happen to expire in the night and that the little helpless innocent should find her cold and insensible to her soft touch and voice  as soon as she left me i went to bed but found it impossible to rest  i knew not in what manner to act sir william would probably be displeased at my interfering in colonel walters affairs yet was i determined at all events to fulfill my promise to this amiable unfortunate and protect her and her child as far as it might be in my power  with this resolution i shall now take leave of my dearest fanny as i am extremely fatigued with writing yet would not trespass so far on your patience as to break off again till i had concluded mrs walters story  but interested as i am for her be assured that i am much more so for my beloved fanny and sir george  where is he now my sister has mrs colvilles mystery been explained is his heart more at ease after it and has yours yet recovered that tranquillity which should be the portion of the good and amiable alas why is it not unalienably so yet mrs walter wastes her days in sorrow my fanny mourns her illrequited love sir george hangs pensive over his delias tomb and my sad heart too much in unison with mournful tones responsive echoes back the sighs of all and mingles plaintive notes for its own woes  adieu my dearest sister l barton  letter xxxii miss cleveland to lady barton a thousand thanks to my dear louisa for the pleasing painful entertainment which she has taken the trouble of affording me  which is at present more particularly suited to my situation than any other that could possibly be devised  in quest of happiness we should for ever cast our eyes downward and the tears that flow from them in contemplating the miseries of those who are more wretched than ourselves will at elast stifle the voice of selflove and silence the complaints that arise from lesser sorrows  sometimes imaginary ones  when i compare my sufferings with those of the unfortunate olivia i am shocked at my own ingratitude and impiety for having ever dared to say i was unhappy the greatest misery i have endured falls infinitely short of the least of hers   like her i have been forsaken by the man i love but then i have not like her been exposed to want and ignominy sheltered in the fostering arms of tender and affectionate friends who sympathize even with my weakness in lamenting an inconstant lover blessed with reputation health and fortune  these circumstances render the comparison so very unfair that it must be disadvantageous to make it no she is alone the paragon of unearned sufferings and i hope there is not any one person living who has a right to dispute the painful preeminence with her   but where is she now louisa it is not possible that you can have left her in that pandaemonium which the great fiend inhabits i cannot speak of colonel walter in milder terms i am provoked that the infernal should have any shadow of pretense for his barbarity to his angelic wife  when the world once gets hold of a tale of scandal is it not easy to wrest it from them  that wicked marchioness  but there will be no end to my letter if i go on entering into particulars  all i can say upon the whole is this that i fear your bringing her to southfield may engage sir william in a strife either with the colonel or yourself no one can tell which part he will take i should rather apprehend his siding with the monster and quarrelling with you for intermeddling  to avoid all this apprehension if mrs walter be able to bear the journey on the easiest terms it can be made to her request you to send her and her child over to me as quick as possible i will receive her with open arms and do every thing in my power to procure her health and peace i have no person to whom i am accountable for my conduct and therefore stand clearer from difficulty in this affair than you do  i hope these reasons will incline both mrs walter and you to comply with my entreaty and that i shall soon have the happiness of embracing the two lovely olivias  she may depend on my secrecy i can prepare this family in half an hour for the reception of a lady and her daughter from france whom i have invited to spend some time with me i will carry her to bristol or any other place that may aid her recovery  she must not die louisa and for heavens sake let me have the happiness of being concerned in her preservation  i fear self his predominated too much in this wish for indeed i look forward with an uncommon degree of impatience to the pleasure of having it in my power to serve such an amiable creature  do my louisa then indulge me with the true enjoyment of the fortune i am possessed of  let me know the transport of succouring merit in distress and i shall henceforward look upon riches as a real blessing  i have this moment received a letter from our dear brother that has amazed me  what think you is the pretended request of the dying delia why nothing more than that sir george should marry her mother i have long suspected her passion for my brother i knew her to be an artful that is in other words a vile woman i cannot help the evil thoughts which obtrude themselves on my mind with regard to my dear delias death  if mrs colville be innocent heaven forgive me  but i have not charity enough to pray for her if she should be guilty  sir george does not express half the horror that i feel at this shocking proposal the gratification which our vanity receives in knowing we are beloved even by the most worthless person can i perceive soften our contempt into compassion and deceive us so far as to make us think such pity the offspring of our virtue  however do not be alarmed for though he speaks somewhat too tenderly of her pretended sorrow i am certain no power on earth could ever make him think of such an unnatural alliance  i have little to say of myself nothing of moment has happened to me since i wrote last and i endeavor to think as little as possible of what happened before  adieu my dear louisa i hope there is a letter of yours now traveling toward me for i am most extremely impatient to know what you have done or intend to do with mrs walter i beg you to assure her of my affectionate regard and to believe me ever  most truly yours f cleveland  letter xxxiii lady barton to miss cleveland southfield this letter my fanny shall go on in the narrative style at least so far as it relates to mrs walter for as her adventures are entirely detached from any thing relative to us i will not mingle them with mine  i lay till it was very late on the morning that the fair unfortunate had related her story yet i had neither slept nor fixed upon any scheme for delivering her from her hated prison except that of bringing her and her child to southfield which i foresaw must be attended with very hazardous consequences i therefore summoned a little council the moment i arose and after communicating the most distressful circumstances of her situation to lucy harriet and my faithful benson i desired them to give me their advice how to act on this critical occasion having first informed them that i was determined not to desert the cause i had undertaken by leaving this amiable woman to perish at waltersburgh  various as you may suppose were the plans offered and rejected  it was at last agreed that we should return home as soon as possible and that mrs walter should remain where she was for three or four days after our departure that in that time benson should be employed in fitting up a chamber for her reception in the house of one of our tenants whom i formerly mentioned to you as having his house burned and who had now got a very comfortable though small habitation within a short walk of southfield that as soon as every thing was prepared benson should come for her in my chaise to a particular spot at a time appointed and convey her and the little olivia to this house where she was to remain in profound secrecy till we saw what effect this innocent elopement might produce till every thing in our power should have been done for the recovery of her health and till we could fix upon some more eligible plan for her future happiness  as the colonels servants gave themselves not the least trouble about the fair recluse we found it very easy to convey proper food to her unobserved and as i thought it right that she should have time to consider of our scheme i wrote to her directly and desired to have the pleasure of another interview with her in my apartment that night  i gave her to understand in the politest manner i could my reasons for declining to bring her directly to southfield at least till i had consulted my husband and assured her in the strongest terms that while i lived neither she or her child should ever be reduced to the misery of seeking support or protection from the inhuman colonel walter i added every thing that i thought could soothe her mind and implored her to take care of her health for the sake of her lovely infant  she replied almost instantly to my letter poured forth the warmest acknowledgments for my goodness again called me her guardian angel and said she was ready to be guided by me in every thing and that as the strongest mark of her gratitude she would at my command endeavor to live were it only to bless and thank me  the impatience of lucy and harriet to see mrs walter was extreme they looked at their watches an hundred times and would fain have persuaded themselves they did not go from the moment it grew dusk till our hour of retiring though it was yet a moot point whether they were to see her or no as i meant first to ask her permission certainly before i should present them to her  when she entered my apartment her countenance seemed at once more animated and composed than it had been the preceding night  the effusions of her gratitude were such as must flow from a heart like hers and were more fully expressed by the silent eloquence of tears than by the pomp of words  she readily and most gracefully complied with the request i made her of giving me leave to introduce lucy and harriet to her who notwithstanding the description i had given them of the delicacy and elegance of her form were both amazed when they beheld her and could hardly consider her as of flesh and blood but rather a form of unsubstantial air or else composed of that fine either with which we suppose angels indue themselves when they deign to become visible on earth  as both mrs walter and i wanted rest we parted sooner than we had done the foregoing night after having first settled every thing for the execution of our project and fixed on the day following for my quitting waltersburg benson packed up a part of hers and olivias clothes with mine and we contrived to leave her every little necessary that could be conducive to her comfort or convenience while she remained behind us  i have now the pleasure to tell you that every thing succeeded to our wishes and that she and her sweet girl are safely and privately lodged at honest farmer wilsons for the present i write to her every day by benson but have not yet ventured to see her as i am not able to walk and the eclat of my carriage stopping at a farmhouse might occasion suspicion  benson assures me that she already perceives a change for the better in her appearance and i begin to hope she may recover both her health and peace of mind the little olivia is quite wild with spirits and is trying to learn english from lucy who visits mrs walter every day and the first words she desired to be taught were meant to express her thanks to me for my kindness to her mamma  though i reflect with sincere pleasure on having been able to rescue this amiable woman from a scene of the severest distress yet i cannot help feeling an anxiety for her future fate which gives me extreme pain  she cannot long remain where she is undiscovered and no one can tell what step that barbarian her husband may take to distress her yet farther  my apprehensions are that he will force olivia from her and the loss of her child would i am certain occasion the loss of her life  but supposing that he should never discover her retreat or even inquire about her i see no asylum except a convent where her youth and beauty will not subject her to a thousand misfortunes  you are sufficiently acquainted ith my sentiments on the subject of monasteries to know how very unwilling i should be to recommend a state of seclusion to any creature i either love or esteem yet in her unhappy situation i see no other resource  however i shall not advise precipitately  not but that i should approve extremely of an establishment of this kind in our own country under our own religion and laws both equally free from tyranny  an asylum for unhappy women to retreat to  not from the world but from the misfortunes or the slander of it  for female orphans young widows or still more unhappy objects forsaken or ill treated wives to betake themselves to in such distresses for in all these circumstances women who live alone have need of something more than either prudence or a fair character to guard them from rudeness or censure  now some sort of foundation under the government of a respectable matronage endowed for such a purpose would certainly be an institution most devoutly to be wished for as a relief in the difficulties of those situations i have just mentioned here women might enjoy all the pleasures and advantages of living still in the world have their conduct reciprocally vouched by one another and be screened from those artful and insidious essays which young or pretty women when once become helpless adjectives of society are generally liable to  i have had a letter from sir william and for once he seems pleased with my determination of staying in the country this has made me very happy  though had he commanded my attendance in dublin i would have obeyed for i will at least endeavor to deserve the character which the offended moor gives of the gentle desdemona  as you say obedient  very obedient  and as i have already told my fanny that is all that i can at present promise  i think it is a little century since i have heard from you i suppose you did not choose to interrupt me in my narrative but i expect and i think reasonably that you should now hold forth in your turn and allow me credit for the entertainment which i am certain you must have received from mrs walters story i have this moment got a card from miss ashford to congratulate me on my recovery and to let me know that lord lucan and she will wait on me this afternoon  is it not odd fanny that i should not have heard of his being at sir arthur ashfords till now perhaps he went there directly from waltersburgh if so he must certainly be attached to miss ashford but of what consequence are his engagements to me  i shall not know how to behave to him uncertain as i am with regard to that unaccountable adventure at colonel walters  if he is innocent of that insult he will be astonished at the coldness and distance of my manners toward him if guilty surely his own confusion will betray him and he shall never see my face again  but why should he bring miss ashford with him to southfield does not this look as if he feared an explanation guilty guilty upon honor  adieu my sister louisa barton  letter xxxiv lady barton to miss cleveland i have such a variety of subjects to treat of that i know not which to begin with but i think i ought to pay my dear fanny the compliment of attending first to her long wishedfor and truly welcome letter  i had not a doubt but that your humanity would be both affected and interested for the unhappy mrs walter the goodness both of your head and heart is eminently conspicious in the proper use you have made of her misfortunes to lighten and invalidate our own sufferings by comparing them with those of others is truly philosophic but that firmness of mind or rather toughness of heart which enables us to bear our own miseries with patience and composure is in general but too apt to render us callous to those tender feelings which should be excited by the woes of others  let me then congratulate myself on having a sister whose stoicism is confined only to herself while her tenderness and compassion are extended to the numerous the unbounded circle of the unhappy  yes my fanny your request shall be complied with mrs walter is already made happy in the hope of being known to such a generous mind as yours she has confessed to me that in her present situation she had suffered a thousand apprehensions lest my kindness to her might involve me in difficulties with sir william but that she could think of no expedient to prevent this evil but flying to a convent which she feared to propose as her going there must be attended with what she thought too considerable an expense  i should have strongly objected to this scheme from her ill state of health though she is however amazingly recovered since her enlargement from that worse than prison where her poor mind was fettered though her limbs were free  and i have great hopes from the calm state in which she now appears of her recovery  she has really an extraordinary understanding allowing for her youth and inexperience and from that i trust that she will be able to conquer the tenderness she formerly felt for the most worthless of his sex  she is to set out this night for cork where she is consigned to the care of an eminent merchant a particular friend of lucy leisters who will ensure her a passage in one of the best ships that sails from thence to bristol  on her arrival there she is to be put into the care of bensons niece who is married to a stationer and is commanded by her aunt to attend her up to london and lodge her safe under your kind protection one of farmer wilsons daughters goes with her to attend the little olivia  the girl has lived in some creditable families and is tolerably clever  both mrs walter and her lovely child have made an astonishing progress in learning english they have capacities for every thing  when the moment arrives of bidding her adieu which it shortly must i shall be sensible of a more mixed sensation than i have ever felt before i know that i ought to rejoice at our separation for her sake but i cannot help being selfish enough to regret it for my own  amazement falls infinitely short of what i felt when i read the paragraph in your letter relative to mrs colville i am shocked as well as you at the train of ideas which obtruded themselves upon me in consequence of her unnatural proposal  alarmed about my brother no heaven forbid that i should ever think of him in such a light he ever disliked and he must now detest her  but sir george is of a mild and gentle nature not apt to give the reins to his resentments his natural and acquired good breeding must prevent his speaking hardly of a woman who even pretends to love him and the involuntary respect with which he is inspired for delias mother must increase his restraint and silence every sarcastical reflection  now for myself  i know not what to think about lord lucan never was confusion equal to mine at seeing him  this rendered me incapable of observing him but lucy who was present at our interview assured me there was nothing particular in his appearance except the paleness of his countenance and his surprise at my manner which i am sure must have been perfectly distrait  why did he bring miss ashford here she doubtless remarked the alteration in my behavior and i am perhaps at this moment the object of their ridicule  i never saw her look so handsome as she did that evening  i suppose they will soon be married i wish it was over and that they were both gone to his seat in the north  i have been extremely uneasy these three days about my little harriet  she looks ill and neither eats or sleeps yet will not allow that she is sick i should certainly apprehend her being in love if she had seen any object lately that could have inspired her with that passion  no my dear fanny my adventure at waltersburgh was not a dream yet i sometimes think with you that lord lucan could never have been guilty of such an indecorum though i do not now agree with you that he is at all affected with any particular sentiment toward me and i sincerely rejoice in dissenting from your opinion on this subject  by sending mrs walter to you i have barred my own hopes of seeing you in ireland and i alas have none of meeting you in england  i cannot let this effort of generosity pass without marking it for perhaps it is the highest exertion of that virtue which i may ever have an opportunity of displaying  i go now to bid adieu to your future charge  she will have the happiness of seeing my fanny almost as soon as this can reach her hands  an involuntary sigh has just escaped me down selfish thoughts  farewell my dear sister l barton  letter xxxv miss cleveland to lady barton i have received your letter my louisa and i have also received your fair your lovely friend mrs walter arrived in doverstreet last night  prepared as i was by your description the extreme delicacy of her form surpassed my imagination  i can scarcely persuade myself that she is compounded of the same materials of which common mortals are made at least i am certain that there must be as much difference as there is between the clay of which the finest porcelain is formed and that which makes the coarsest earthenware  i am sorry to say the simile is strengthened by an appearance of extreme fragility and weakness which alarms ones tenderness into a kind of apprehension for her safety every moment and is in my mind infinitely more interesting than the most healthful glow of beauty in its highest bloom  i am sure if i were a man i should be in love with her and of course miserable for i could not help considering her but as a mere beauteous shadow which arough blast too quickly might dissolve  but though not a lover i am determined to cherish this fair idea and for that purpose i shall take lodgings at kensington gravelpits tomorrow for three weeks or a month as i do not think the season far enough advanced to carry her to the hotwells or venture her even so far as clevelandhall  there is as you have already observed something uncommonly engaging in her manner of speaking but her sentiments need no addition  i never heard such warm yet elegant expressions of gratitude as she used in speaking of you her tears flowed fast while she uttered them the little olivia took her hand and said mamma lady barton is so good that i know it would grieve her to think she made you weep for i am sure she meant to dry your tears  but mrs walter is at this moment writing to you i will therefore leave her to express her own sentiments which she will do much better than i can because she feels more  i am charmed with your scheme of an english protestant monastery though i am much afraid that both you wrote and i read that passage in your letter with too selfish feelings and reflections the general idea of convents i am as much averse to as you are and i am sure that none of those abroad would be a proper retreat for our fair client  the strictness of their institutions and the harshness of their discipline would soon dispatch her to the region of saints besides such a place would be as unfit for one in her state of mind as well as of body  need the already unhappy afflict themselves still further with austerities  there is a paragraph in your letter which gives me infinite concern my dear louisa must no longer boast a heart quite free from love  she is i am afraid a stricken deer but i will hope that the wound is not mortal and that it may yet be healed though not without a cicatrice  why  ask yourself my sister why all these apprehensions about miss ashford why is she to be married to lord lucan merely because she came with him to visit you and why should you suspect an amiable young woman of such mean malice as without provocation to attempt to render you ridiculous  these are not the genuine feelings of my louisas heart the stings of jealousy have instilled its venom and this passion has but two sources pride and love  i most sincerely wish that lord lucan and miss ashford were married and that they were gone to his lordships seat in the north or to any other point of the compass that may be most remote from the neighborhood of southfield  i cannot help trembling for your happiness louisa  i well know that i have nothing else to fear for but is not that sufficient i have with pain long beheld your growing partiality for his lordship yet i hoped against the conviction of my own heart which still overflows with tenderness for an unworthy object that you would be able to conquer it  but let me here observe louisa that our situations are so widely different that the weakness which may in mine not only be pardoned but pitied becomes criminal in yours  this you may possibly say is hard measure but as we were none of us in a condition to make terms for ourselves before we came into the world we must submit to those that this same world has imposed on us since and believe me that they who struggle least against those chains which custom has forged for our sex are least likely to feel their weight  the world is jealous of its rites it haughtily resents and harshly chastizes the smallest breach of them nor did i ever know a man or woman who boasted that they despised its laws and trusted to their own integrity who were not soon severely punished by its contempt or censure  so much by way of censor now let the friend and sister plead for the preservation of your peace which cannot be maintained with loss of fame though conscious innocence might plead your justification ever so strongly  should your character happen to be impeached from any misconduct of yours remember that your husband has a right to resent your having forfeited the highest trust which manly confidence can commit to female delicacy the preservation both of his honor and her own and that from that moment you must appear in the light of a criminal toward him at least though you stand ever so clear with regard to yourself how truly humiliating must such a situation be to a mind like yours  i have drawn this sad prospect in the strongest colors in hopes that my louisa will start from the brink of the precipice where she now stands and instantly retreat into the gentle path of domestic happiness  i am truly grieved that the roughness of sir williams manners may render this walk less smooth and pleasing than it should be yet surely it is easier to tread on pebbles than on thorns and with the latter we shall certainly find those ways strewed that lead from the road which providence has marked out for us  i should detest myself if i were able to add another line on this subject yet i hope that my tears have not so much blotted what i have already written as to prevent your reading it  mrs walter is determined to write to her husband and i think her right in it for some of the reasons given above though heaven knows she owes him no compliment nor scarcely duty  she shall not however if i can prevent her write for some days as it must hurry her poor weak spirits which want much to be recruited  i have not heard from my brother for some time adieu  my ever dear louisa f cleveland  letter xxxvi lord hume to lord lucan if i were not perfectly convinced of the fallacy of judicial astrology i should fancy you were a conjurer lucan and that you had calculated margaritas nativity  how else could you at such a distance discover that she was compounded of art while i who saw her every day and all the day was so thoroughly hoodwinked by her beauty as to imagine her mind as faultless as her form what a numscull what a coxcomb have i been she had cunning enough to persuade and i folly enough to believe that she loved me to distraction  for the rest of my life i shall consider myself as an idiot though yon are to take notice that i will not be called so even by you  but the worst of it is that i am a ruined fool too  dont laugh lucan i shall be ready to cut your throat if you do but i know you will not when i tell you that i am severely hurt  in my last i acquainted you that i had lost a large sum at play and was waiting at venice for remittances which arrived in a few days  margarita had a mind as she said that we should quit venice with a coup declat and prevailed on me to hire jewels to the amount of two thousand pounds to ornament herself on the last night of our appearance at the carnival i readily complied with her request though i had before laid out very near that sum in the same sort of trumpery for her  she looked like an angel when she was dressed that i must acknowledge and i never once thought of searching for the cloven foot beneath such a dazzling brightness  we went together to the masquerade and with us a man she called her brother whom i have since discovered to be her galant and a notorious sharper i soon engaged at play  fortune favored me for a time but before the conclusion of the night she was at her old tricks again and i lost fivehundred guineas  the agitation naturally attendant on the vicissitudes of play had taken off my attention even from margarita so that i felt no anxiety at not having seen her for several hours it was very late when i went home and judge of my amazement when i was told she had not returned from the time we set out together  i flew back again into the street and ran like a distracted man into every house that was open but the company were retired from every place and i could find no trace of her  i will not pretend to give you an idea of my situation for i can now hardly recollect the state of my mind at that time much less describe it  about nine oclock in the morning a mendicant friar brought a letter to my door in which were contained these words  to lord hume i entreat you my dear lord and quondam lover not to be uneasy on my account i am well and happy and before this can reach you shall be out of the venetian dominions all search after me will be in vain i should not have quitted you so abruptly if i had not discovered that my staying with you would have been an injury to your fortune which i imagine is already much hurt  but you englishmen can always repair such damages by marriage  i have therefore removed the only obstacle to the amendment of your circumstances by tearing myself from you and do now most seriously recommend it to you to return to your own country and avail yourself of this last resource  those trifles of yours which i have taken with me i shall still preserve as tokens of your liberality which is allowed to be the national virtue of the english and i shall ever remain your lordships  much obliged and obedient servant m del strazzi   the reading of this letter entirely conquered every passion of my mind but rage and i think i could at that moment have stranged the insolent gypsy who wrote it  but i was not suffered to brood over it long for the jew from whom i had hired the jewels came to demand them  i knew not what to do i had settled with my banker the day before and as i intended leaving venice i had withdrawn my letter of credit and had not half so much cash as would answer the israelites demand  lord stormont happened luckily to come in to pay me a visit i frankly told him my distress and he kindly lent me a draft on his banker which satisfied old shylock  i wrote on the instant to my agent to cut down a wood that was planted for ought i know by my greatgrandfather and thus my good tall oaks that have been at least fourscore years growing have vanished into the hands of jews and jades for one nights no diversion at the carnival  indeed lucan i begin to think that we english are very silly fellows but why should i lump my countrymen when i am really convinced that there is not such another noodle in the world as myself  how go on your love affairs they cannot be in such a desperate state as mine  our countrywomen have not spirit enough to strike such a stroke as my diavolessa has done and i now begin to think that a man had better be contented with the wholesome homebrewed beer of old england than pay too dear for tokay  now i talk of england i should like very well to return there if i were not ashamed to see fanny cleveland and afraid of being laughed at by my old friends at almacs and boodles and in short every where  do my dear lucan tell me what i shall do with myself for i am at present the most desolate as well as desultory of mortals  but in all states i shall continue affectionately yours  hume  letter xxxvii lord lucan to lord hume my dear hume as you have made it a point i will not laugh at what you seem to consider as a misfortune but you must permit me to say that i have not received so much pleasure for a long time as from your account of margaritas elopement  believe me my friend you have got cheaply off even with the loss of some thousands  character is of infinitely more value than fortune  but i am persuaded that both yours would have been totally ruined had you continued much longer connected with that most infamous and artful woman  there is nothing so very particular in your adventure as to make you apprehend yourself peculiarly ridiculous for i will take upon me to say that there is not one in ten of our countrymen that has made the same tour which you have done who has not been duped by some jay of italy  dont publish the story yourself and others will be cautious how they mention it to you  i will also venture to promise that miss cleveland has too much delicacy herself to wound yours though i have not the honor of knowing her  if you have no other objections but those i have alluded to and which i have sufficiently obviated i would by all means wish you to return immediately to england  but prythee why my dear hume have you made a comparison so extremely injurious to our fair countrywomen whose beauty is at least the boast of europe nor do i believe that either georgia or the grecian isles can produce any thing that surpasses them in loveliness or elegance of form your homebrewed beer was a simile for a porter or at best for a mere hunting squire  i am firmly persuaded from this instance that you have conversed more with englishmen than foreigners since you have been on the continent  this is one of the unpardonable absurdities common to our nation  we go or are sent abroad by our friends  i had almost said our enemies  at great expense and then instead of informing ourselves of the manners and police of the places we are in our first pursuit is to find out our countrymen and herd with them continually merely because they are so by which conduct we contrive still to retain those prejudices we should have left at home and cultivate only the follies and vices we meet with abroad  but a truce with reflections of every kind and in answer to your query with regard to the situation of my heart i can with truth assure you that it is infinitely more wretched than your own  i never had the least reason to flatter myself with the most distant idea of being beloved by the object of my passion yet had my vanity inspired me with the fond hope of having obtained some small share in her friendship and esteem  how i have forfeited this blessing i know not but it now is fled my friend and with it all my happiness  i have been for some time past at the seat of sir arthur ashford you must remember him at college he has a sister who is both handsome and agreeable and had i a disengaged heart i know no woman to whom i would sooner offer my hand  but never shall i be guilty of such baseness as to defraud an innocent and amiable woman of her affections while like a wretched bankrupt i have not an equivalent to make  the circumstance of miss ashfords living with her brother will prevent my spending as much of my time with him as i could wish  the world will be apt to suppose that her attractions might have drawn me thither and this may possibly prevent a real and deserving lover from making his addresses there  i will therefore speedily retire to my own seat to solitude and sorrow  you are incapable of forming any idea of the charming delicate but distracted situation of my mind  may happier days be yours adieu  my friend lucan  letter xxxviii lady barton to miss cleveland southfield yes fanny i confess it you have searched my bosom and found the arrow rankling in my heart too cruel sister better sure far better that you had remained ignorant of my disease unless you can prescribe a cure i now detest myself and all that generous confidence which is the true result and firm support of real virtue is for ever fled i shrink even from the mild eye of friendship  the tender the affectionate looks of harriet and lucy now distress me how then shall i endure the stern expression of contempt and rage from an offended husbands angry brow there is but one thing that could be more dreadful  i mean his kindness  that alone could add new horrors to my wretched state and make me feel the humiliating situation of a criminal still more than i now do  i am i am a criminal alas you know not to what degree i am so but i will tell you all lay bare my heart before you and beg you not to soothe but probe its wounds  at about a quarter of a mile from our house there is an octagon temple which overlooks a fine piece of water adjoining to which there is a beautiful and extensive wood this room then i have fitted up in a very elegant taste as a small library or museum for myself and it is entirely devoted to my hours of retirement  here i read write draw or ruminate in this spot on the day after i last wrote to you was i sitting and musing i will confess it on the happiness which might have been my portion had i happened to have met lord lucan before i was sir william bartons wife  the tears streamed insensibly from my eyes and so much dimmed my sight as to make it doubtful whether the figure i then saw of lord lucan walking by the canal was real or visionary  i rose immeditaely to the window and perceived it to be him  he came slowly on gazing intently on a miniature picture which he sometimes pressed to his lips and sometimes held at a distance as if to place it in different points of view blushing i own it fanny i felt the pangs of jealousy i doubted not but it was miss ashfords picture and instantly detested the origiginal  how unworthy how unjust do i now appear in my own sight  my feet became as much rivetted to the place where i stood as lord lucans eyes were to the picture  he saw me not till he came close to the window and then in the utmost confusion slipped the portrait into his pocket  he came into the temple covered with blushes made a thousand apologies for having intruded upon my retirement though he said he had come on purpose to take his leave as he meant to quit sir arthur ashfords and set out for his own seat the next day  with more pique than prudence i told him that i was surprised at his having resolution sufficient to tear himself from a person whose picture was so dear to him as i supposed that to be to which i had seen him pay his adorations when i fancied he might have the original as a companion for life if he chose it  i never saw surprise so strongly painted as in his countenance  his voice faltered while he replied were that possible madam i should be the happiest man alive  but alas there is a bar an insuperable bar which cannot be surmounted therefore madam do i tear myself from the too lovely object of a despairing passion  i was very near as much confused as lord lucan and without knowing what i said replied i pity you my lord and am truly sorry  at that instant he in an extacy exclaimed o stop most honored most beloved of women nor raise my transports to that dangerous height which may exceed to madness yet yet again repeat the charming sound and by your pity overpay my sufferings  it was impossible for any one not quite an idiot to misunderstand this declaration  yet was i absurd enough to seem ignorant of his meaning and answered that i did not conceive of what use my pity could be to him as i could not hope to have more influence on miss ashford than himself  he started from his seat and with a look that seemed to pierce through all my little artifice cried out miss ashford madam how is it her concern surely my lord i replied i thought it was that ladys picture with which you seemed so much delighted as you walked along  he gazed on me again with earnestness as he would read my thoughts and then with downcast looks as speaking to himself he said  it must be so that form that angel form cannot deceive and my temerity is yet a secret  it shall remain so for i will fly for ever from her sight  he turned away his face to hide his tears and had i suffered our conversation to have ended there i had been far less guilty than i am  but vanity that bane of female virtue led me on to tell him that i could not be satisfied without a farther explanation on this subject and that as he had declared miss ashford was not the object of his passion i hoped he could have no objection to showing me the picture of a person whom in all probability i neither did nor possibly might ever know  he looked at me then with a countenance more solemn than i had ever seen him wear i blushed excessively from a consciousness of my own insincerity he saw into my thoughts and with a firm and yet affecting manner spoke thus  do not for your own sake madam extend the cruelty of your triumph beyond my demerits nor wantonly sport with the miseries of one whom yon have though innocently rendered wretched nature formed you in her most perfect model and gave me susceptibility to admire those charms which to my endless grief were then devoted to another  i sought not madam to invade his right or soil the purity of your fair bosom with one improper thought your friendship your esteem i wished to gain and for that purpose kept my love concealed chance only has revealed it  how am i to blame or wherefore should i now become the object of your hatred or contempt your pity was the sole indulgence i ever should have dared to have solicited and that you might without a crime have bestowed the wildness of my passion flattered my fond hopes that you had just now granted it  judge of its value by my transports madam  but you recall the precious gift and all that i now dare presume to ask is your forgiveness allow me that and never more shall the unhappy lucan offend your eyes or feast his own with gazing on your charms  tears stopped his utterance  o fanny was it possible that my eyes should be dry they streamed too surely  i confess my weakness  at that moment my heart first felt the luxury of tears  the soft effusion flowed from pity from tenderness from  dare i pronounce it love  the emotion he discovered at seeing me weep was quite extravagant  he threw himself at my feet snatched my hand and pressed it to his lips and vowed he would never rise till i pronounced his pardon at that instant i heard the sound of voices that approached us and exclaimed rise my lord i pardon and i pity you  he had scarce time to obey me before colonel walter lucy and harriet entered the temple  the apparent confusion both of lord lucans looks and mine with the tears that still trembled in our eyes was but too visible to pass unnoticed lucy appeared surprised at the sight of lord lucan harriets face was covered with blushes and the colonel by a malignant smile showed that he enjoyed our distress  he presented me with a letrer from sir william whom he had left in dublin and said he hoped that would plead his excuse for having interrupted what he thought the most agreeable party in the world a sentimental tete a tete and turning briskly to lord lucan asked him if he had been relating the melancholy story of eloise and abelard or the more disastrous loves of hero and leander  pique now got the better of my confusion and without waiting for lord lucans reply i answered that we need not go so far back for melancholy tales for that i was acquainted with some persons now living whose sufferings far exceeded those of the unfortunate ladies he had mentioned he turned his piercing eyes quick upon me at these words and for the first time of his life i believe blushed  o fanny what an indiscreet and consequently unhappy wretch is your sister thank heaven mrs walter is out of his reach but have i not by this unguarded speech betrayed the secret to her tyrant i never shall forgive myself  my lucy ever kind and attentive to her now unworthy friend relieved us all from our embarrassment by rendering the conversation general and proposed our returning to the house as there was hardly time for me to dress before dinner and added that she would either endeavor to entertain the gentlemen at the harpsichord or engage with them at billiards  we then all set out seemingly at ease  but who can read the human heart or the various springs that actuate its movements mine wretched as it is had then received a hateful guest unknown to it before consciousness of having erred its sure attendants fear and shame now followed close and when i reached my toilet and viewed my shadow in the glass my color varied as these passions worked and i became alternate red and pale  poor benson saw the effect without the cause and was alarmed  she would have got me drops which i refused sick sick at heart i was but where is the medicine that can abate its conflicts lethe o for a draught of it  a shower of tears somewhat relieved me i read sir williams letter cruellest of husands it was the kindest that he had ever wrote since he obtained that title he will return to southfield in a few days  how shall i look upon him fanny  i cannot now go on my next shall tell you all  l barton ps i have read mrs walters letter and yours but am at present incapable of answering either    letter xxxix lady barton to miss cleveland southfield amidst the variety of disagreeable thoughts which had disturbed me curiosity asserted its rights in a female breast and increased my uneasiness by a wish to know how lord lucan had obtained my picture  i never had but two miniatures taken of me one in my happy days for my dear fanny and a second last winter in dublin at the earnest request of my niece soon after she came to live with us  it was impossible that he should be in possession of the first and a train of very unpleasant ideas succeeded to the thought of harriets having given him the latter  i sent for her directly  when she came into my dressing room i perceived she had been weeping and i also perceived my picture on her arm  this put a stop to the inquiry i had designed to make and by way of saying something i asked her where lord lucan was she said she had just then left him in sir williams library  my curiosity was again raised to know the cause of harriets tears i could not ask her  but my heart informed me  she loves lord lucan  unhappy girl yet still far happier than i she may without a blush avow her passion while mine must cover me with endless shame  yet wherefore should there be this false distinction if passion is involuntary it cannot be criminal it is consequences only that can make it so and harriet and louisa both may love with innocence   flattering sophistry alas i would deceive myself but cannot have i not vowed even at the altar vowed to love another yet can that vow be binding which promises what is not in our power even at the time we make it but grant it were the contract sure is mutual and when one fails the other should be free  wretched louisa strive no more to varnish over thy faults  thou were a criminal in the first act who wedded without love and all the miseries which proceed from thence too justly are thy due  yes fanny i will take your counsel and will patiently submit to those corrosive chains which i myself have riveted i will not murmur but i must complain to you and you alone my friend my sister desert me not while i deserve your pity and i will still endeavor to deserve it  lord lucan is gone my entreaties have prevailed he returns not to ashpark or southfield any more  do not congratulate me on this imaginary triumph i have bought the concession but too dear  i have avowed my love do not detest me fanny i saw no other way to secure my virtue  by confessing my passion i have put it out of my power ever to see or converse with the object or it more  he is banished for ever from my sight  what would my sister or what the rigid world have more  with infinite difficulty i discovered that the innocent and undesigning harriet had lent him my picture and he sent off his servant to france to get it copied who returned with it to ashpark on the day i first saw it in his hand  i shall never take notice of this affair to her as i too well know how difficult it must be to refuse the request of one we love  but surely his making this request must have severely pained her tender heart  sweet gentle innocent i most sincerely pity her distress  the detestable colonel walter stays with us still though unasked  i think he looks with prying eyes on all my actions yet what are they to him he has no friendship either for sir william for me or any one else  cruel consciousness that compelled me to banish lord lucan and suffer colonel walter to remain in my house have i not fanny sufficiently sacrificed to forms and scruples  i have this moment received a letter from sir william business detains him for a month longer in town  i rejoice for his sake as much as my own as i hope i shall recover a greater degree of composure than i am at present mistress of by the time he returns  i detest dissimulation yet as lucilla says dissembling may for once be virtuous the fair penitent at least so far as to conceal that fault which cannot now be prevented  yet trust me sir william trust me my honored brother and beloved sister no stain shall ever rest upon your names from my misconduct i only ought and i alone will suffer  my vow is passed to heaven and to you  this unhappy subject has so totally engrossed my thoughts that i find it impossible to think of any other excuse me therefore to our amiable friend mrs walter embrace her and kiss the young olivia for me tell me of all your healths and happiness which will supply some to your ever  affectionate sister l barton ps the colonel has never taken the least notice of the suspicious appearances in the temple  he has informed us that his intended match with mrs layton is quite off seems perfectly gay and alert and appears inclined to pay his addresses to miss ashford  i have injured her without design but should he have the least chance to succeed there i will atone the injury i have done her by preventing the connection  lucy sets off this moment  an express from her lover who lies dangerously ill in dublin hurries her away  she is distracted  i envy her distraction  she may to all the world declare her grief her love for the deserving creswell    letter xl miss cleveland to lady barton indeed my louisa your two last letters have afflicted me beyond measure my heart bleeds for your sufferings yet reason and virtue both forbid my endeavoring to soothe your grief or stop your flowing tears unless i could remove the cause from whence they spring  that alas can only be hoped for from the lenient hand of time and your own fortitude  i know how very difficult it is to enter so far into another persons situation as is necessary to judge their actions with candor we must first feel and think as they do before it can become possible  i have therefore endeavored by a thorough recollection of your temper and sentiments joined to the similarity of our natures to put myself as it were in your place in order to be able with justice and precision to give my opinion freely both with regard to your past and future conduct  i will now venture to tell you that the source of your present unhappiness is to be traced much higher than the era you date it from your marriage with sir william barton  though i admit your own confession that your first fault was committed then  it must be the joining of hearts not hands that can insure the marriage rights  i dont mispell the word alluding to the word rites  and the woman who stretches out an empty hand at the altar but mocks the institution and if i may hazard the boldness of the expression becomes guilty before her crime receives an antepast of misery and puts her trust in miracles for safety  but the partiality of our ever dear and respected parents sowed the first seeds of vanity in my louisas mind they lived not long enough to be alarmed at its growth and to eradicate the poisonous weed  by their death you became your own mistress at an age when selfapplause is predominant in every female breast  young beautiful rich and accomplished how was it possible you should escape the snares of flattery they twined about your heart and i have great reason now to believe and lament that the envied preference you gave to sir william barton by becoming his wife was owing more to his having persevered longer than the rest of your admirers in his attentions and attendance on you than to that just selection which should be the reward of distinguished merit and in which both love and esteem should happily unite  at the time of your marriage i had made but very slight observations on the matrimonial state and therefore did not doubt that though you declared yourself insensible of any passion for sir william you might be perfectly happy with him all the days of your life  i am now convinced of the fallacy of this opinion as well as of the imprudence of the declaration you then too openly and unguardedly made  believe me louisa that this was the first thing that soured your husbands temper  men are naturally proud and jealous they do not easily brook disappointments or mortifications a hopeless pursuit must be attended with both  we are not then to wonder either at sir williams declining it or resenting his ill success  in a former letter you say that had sir william continued to solicit your affections a little longer they would have been all his you know not that louisa your vanity was flattered by the assiduities of a lover and your pride revolted at the authority of a husband  neither of these sentiments have any thing to do with passion  had you loved the man you married you would have wished to preserve his affection without being vain of it and had you seen it declining you would have tried every means to recover it without considering how much your pride would be hurt by its loss  there are i am convinced abundance of ingredients necessary to form an happy union for life but love is in my opinion of all others the most necessary  like the sun it not only brightens and gilds every amiable quality of the beloved object but draws forth every latent virtue in our hearts and excites us to become as perfect as we can in order to merit that affection which constitutes our true happiness  milton seems to be of my opinion when he makes the first of lovers and of men say thus to eve   i from the influence of thy looks receive  access in every virtue in thy sight  more wise more watchful stronger if need were  of outward strength while shame thou looking on  shame to be overcome or overreached  would utmost vigor raise and raised unite   i know not why or how i have launched out into this dissertation upon matrimony unless it be that i wish to avoid the painful subject of your last letters and yet cannot turn my thoughts upon any thing quite foreign to it  i think i ought at least to acknowledge that i am pleased with the resolution you have shown in banishing lord lucan and the delicacy of your motive for confessing your passion to him is the only possible excuse that can be urged for such an hazardous impropriety  but let me now hope that my dear louisas virtue will soon enable her to rise above the want of an apology and that a proper consciousness of what she owes to herself will assist her to triumph over that unhappy weakness which she so pathetically describes as the harbinger of fear and shame  hateful destructive passions o be they banished far from every generous breast and in their room may hope and joy expand my sisters heart  mrs walters health continues extremely delicate the physicians who attend her give me hopes that she may recover though slowly  if it were not for that sweet promiser hope i should at this moment be the most wretched of mortals for at this moment every creature that i truly love is unhappy  can i then be otherwise i should be sorry if i could  my brother has given his final negative to mrs colvilles proposal on her account he will not stay longer in paris and on his own he will not return to england  he intends to cross the alps in pursuit of amusement  may he find that and every thing else he wishes  adieu my beloved louisa f cleveland  letter xli lady barton to miss cleveland southfield  then all the boasted office of thy friendship  was but to tell louisa what a wretch she is  alas what need that i cannot help saying fanny that these lines seem but too applicable to your last letter when i poured forth the anguish of my breaking heart before you had i not a right to expect that my friend and sister would have spoken peace to its sorrows and poured wine and oil on its wounds you tell me that reason and virtue forbid these tender offices in my unhappy case are reason and virtue then at war with wretchedness and must guilt be always connected with misery or is it can it be true that misfortunes loosen the ties of blood as well as friendship and leave the wretch infected by them to be hurried down the stream of life at the mercy of their own wild passions more destructive far than raging winds and seas  forgive me fanny for this horrid thought i know your heart is generous and good and that you did not mean to add to my distress  nay i am certain that each wound you gave was doubly felt by you  yet why my sister should you think it necessary to deal severely with me if as you seem to think vanity is my predominant foible why did not my fair philosopher find out its use and play it off against my present weakness we should never humble that heart too much which we have any hopes of reclaiming  when we become completely vile in our own sight we have but little reason to hope for the good opinion of others which i much fear is one of our strongest incitements to virtue and when as you have before observed we are totally indifferent to what the world thinks of us we too generally not only meet but deserve its censure and contempt  a woman still my fanny under all my distresses i am inclined to justify the foible you hint at nay more to prove that it approaches to the very province of virtue as it is at least capable of rousing it to action and sometimes of assisting its operations  respect thyself is certainly one of the best tenets that has ever been conveyed to us  yet surely it savours a little of lamour propre which term though exactly translated by the words self love conveys yet a different idea to my mind and appears to have somewhat more of the lightness of vanity than of a selfapplause in material matters  bravo louisa how admirably have you trifled through this page on a subject absolutely foreign to your heart but has not my fanny set me the example and shall i not endeavor to imitate her alas like all other copyists i fall short of the original for if i write on i shall again recur to the sad source of all my sorrows  again indulge the woman in my soul  and give a loose to tears and to complainings   for your sake then my fanny i will restrain my pen and suffer this letter to reach your hands free from the severe tax which has been too often imposed on you by my late correspondence for indeed i am not merry but do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise  i am running into quotations but they are natural to a disturbed mind as persons in such a state would rather use any bodys sense than their own  for whatever can divert the mind or turn it from its own reflections must be a point gained from misery therefore do i endeavor thus to sport i find in vain for laughter without mirth is but hysterical and may end in tears  my sincerest good wishes attend mrs walter and i may venture to add that i am both to her and you much more than to myself  an affectionate friend l barton  letter xlii miss cleveland to lady barton i might with great truth and justice reply to the lemma of my dear louisas letter by quoting the words that follow it in the original  o rather say  i came to tell her how she might be happy  to soothe the secret anguish of her soul  to comfort that fair mourner that forlorn one  and teach her steps to know the paths of peace fair penitent but though i may not express myself as elegantly as mr row i will trust my defense to the feelings of my heart on a subject where it is so truly interested  if soothing could alleviate your sufferings my pen should be taken from the cygnets wing and dipped in the honey of hybla but alas my sister yours is a disease that will increase by indulgence and which severity alone can cure  there have been instances where the hand of a surgeon has trembled from a consciousness of the misery he was obliged to inflict on his patient  judge then how unsteadily i now hold the pen that is to wound the heart of my louisa by telling her that i fear she has committed an almost irreparable error  i have already told you that it is long since i with grief beheld your partiality for lord lucan but from the idea which you taught me to form of him and from my thorough knowledge of the delicacy and propriety of your sentiments joined to your situation i had lulled myself into a perfect security that lord lucan would never dare to insult the wife of sir william barton with a declaration of his passion and that finding it entirely hopeless he would either conquer or transfer it to some other object from whom he might reasonably expect a proper return  such an attachment as lord lucans be may compared to winter plants which by the aid of hothouses are rendered capable of producing summer fruits but must decay and die without such artificial aid hope is the nurse of love  without it i am certain it cannot long exist even in the most romantic bosom  can i then consider my louisas conduct as blameless when i find lord lucan has avowed his passion but what is the sentence which you would have pronounced twelve months ago upon a married woman who had declared that passion to be mutual guilty guilty upon honor see letter xxxiii p  0   you have still candor enough to judge yourself as severely as you could any one else you acknowledge yourself a criminal but whither are your candor and your judgment both fled when you endeavor to derive merit from what you allow to be a crime and say that you confessed your passion to preserve your virtue  i begin to be extremely apprehensive that reason is a very useless property to man and can seldom do more than direct our choice in things that are merely indifferent to us apathy is not natural to the human mind and yet from the moment our passions begin to operate with any degree of vigor that same boasted reason which philosophers tell us supplies its place by controuling their emotions and directing their pursuits not only becomes instantly subservient to them but meanly condescends to enter into the defense of their most pernicious consequences and readily engages in the pleasing but baneful office of assisting us to impose upon ourselves  this is and must be true  at least i wish to think so for i would much rather attribute my louisas errors to the general defects of our nature than account for them by supposing any particular weakness either in her reason or her virtue  and surely she must herself acknowledge a failure in that judgment that can be persuaded we may set bounds to the encroachments of a lover by telling him that he is beloved  alas louisa lord lucan is not banished from ashpark from southfield from your sight for ever but both the world and i without being over rigid have a right to expect that he should no more be permitted to plead his passion or avail himself of yours  if you should be inclined to dispute the authority which demands this sacrifice let me remind you that there is one who has an undoubted right to claim it let your honor then make a willing sacrifice of all future connection with lord lucan as the only atonement you can now make for the injury you have done sir william barton  by this means and this alone you may again recover your happiness for i know you too well to suppose that it can ever be compatible with a consciousness of continuing to act in opposition to the strictest rectitude  i know too that you have strength of mind sufficient to accomplish this arduous task and that our mental like our bodily strength is increased and invigorated by use that generous frankness which is the genuine offspring of virtue shall again reanimate my beloved louisas face the mild eye of friendship shall no longer be painful to her and she shall endure the piercing look of inquiry from her husbands eyes with soft yet steady dignity  o may my wishes be prophetic amen amen  i will now venture to tell you that i am truly grieved for the young the innocent and amiable harriet my concern may possibly remind you of swifts lines  should some neighbor feel a pain  just in the part where i complain etc   i acknowledge the sympathy between us and would do much to cure her malady  she has however the advantage of me in every respect  she is younger and of course the impression which her heart has received is more likely be erased  the letters we carve on saplings wear out with their growth while those that are imprinted on the perfect tree remain indelible  besides it is by no means impossible that lord lucan may love her yet for i repeat my opinion that his passion for you is quite a sickly plant which must necessarily perish as i am perfectly convinced that you dont mean to cherish it longer  for all these good and weighty reasons i think she may hope or at least i will do so for her that one way or other her heart may be set at ease  i am in a praying mood and will say amen to this wish also  i would add another petition to those i have already made if i hoped it would succeed but i almost begin to despair of mrs walters recovery  she continues to languish without any visible sign of amendment and the physicians now think that the air of a more southern clime is the only chance she has for life  she has written to the good pere guillaume to recommend her to a convent that will receive her and her child as pensioners and allow her the liberty of going out in a carriage for exercise which is absolutely necessary to her existence  were i only to consider myself the pain i feel at the thought of parting with this charming woman would tempt me to wish that i had never known her but how amply am i recompensed for that and a thousand other sufferings by the delightful reflection of having rendered her mind perfectly tranquil nay happy by indulging myself in settling a small but decent provision on her darling child  can all the diamonds that ever issued from the indian mines afford to their possessors that heartfelt glow of satisfaction i enjoyed when i had perfected the deed which conveyed two thousand pounds into the hands of trustees for the use of the young olivia walter  i was so apprehensive that the strong emotions of the mothers gratitude might have affected her delicate frame that i was almost tempted to conceal this matter from her yet i wished to remove every fear or doubt which the weakness and languor of her spirits might suggest with regard to her childs future fate  i wrote her a few lines to tell her what i had done and added that i would debar myself from the pleasure of seeing her till she should give me a promise under her hand never to mention this business to me  she promised indeed what was impossible for her to perform and at our next interview i was convinced that as the peruvian princess says to be thoroughly generous you must listen to acknowledgments  i have promised that if it should please providence to call her to a state of bliss i will immediately take the little olivia under my care and if i live i will most faithfully discharge the pleasing and important trust  my spirits not much elevated before sink under the sad idea of mrs walters death  i cannot at present say more than that i am with unabated tenderness  your truly affectionate sister f cleveland  letter xliii lady barton to miss cleveland seek no longer my fanny to save me from the miseries which i have brought upon myself but try my sister to secure your own peace by devoting to oblivion the memory of a wretch that seems marked for destruction  i feel the snares of fate wound round me and i but vainly struggle to escape the toils  a little gleam of comfort had beamed upon me from your last letter  the kindness of your wishes had raised an ardor in my mind for their accomplishment which amounted almost to a hope of success and i looked forward with anxious desire to some future era when my happiness should confirm your prophecy  in this temper of mind i walked slowly and lonely along to the temple which i have already mentioned to you and if now and then a few vagrant tears strayed down my cheeks i considered them as drops of salutary woe and did not once wish to restrain the healthful current  in fine i may truly say that many weeks have passed since my poor harrassed mind enjoyed so sweet a calm before  when i had reached my little asylum i reread your letter and found but one passage in it that gave me pain i will not now say which it was for that anguish has been entirely absorbed in a far greater one  i took up a pen to write to you which instantly dropped from my hand at the sight of lord lucans portrait which lay before me on the table  by an involuntary motion i took up the picture and looking on it exclaimed  it is too true louisa lord lucan is not banished from southfield from ashpark from my sight for ever  encroaching and presuming man could thou not be content with that ideal likeness which my too fond fancy had already traced upon my mind but at the hazard of my reputation would obtrude this mimic resemblance on my sight  while i pronounced these words the door opened and colonel walter stood before me  i dropped the picture  he took it up  seated himself by me and addressed me in pretty near the same words which polydore uses when he finds monimia in tears  i had just presence of mind enough to say that i was not then disposed to play the fool  he instantly assumed a more serious air caught hold of my hand and insolently declared a passion for me which he boasted had commenced at the same moment with lord lucans  that respect had hitherto kept him silent till he found that his rival was likely to carry away the prize by his audacity and that this alone had determined him to urge his equal attachment to me  surprise had hitherto kept me silent grief now stopped my utterance  i saw myself in the power of a wretch whom i knew to be devoid of generosity or pity  i saw my ruin plain  i see it still  it was in vain to deny my regard for lord lucan  the words which he had heard me utter and the fatal picture which was then in his possession were proofs incontrovertible  my tears had no effect upon him  he pursued his brutal discourse by saying that lord lucan was certainly more calculated for inspiring a romantic childish passion than himself and that he most willingly resigned all the sentimental and platonic part of my affection to him but that i had charms sufficient to render them both happy which he hoped my prudence would incline me to when i reflected that he was not the confident of my choice and had therefore a right to expect that he should be bribed to secresy  i could contain my resentment no longer but with eyes sparkling with indignation bad him fly that moment from my sight and make whatever use his villainy might suggest of the secret which his meanness and insolence had obtained  that i would rely for my justification from his malice on my own innocence and the candor of sir william barton who should certainly be acquainted with the return he made to his friendship  he replied with the most insulting froideur that if sir william had really a friendship for him he would certainly give him a preference in the purchase of a jewel which he neither knew how to value or preserve and in which he seemed to have nothing more at present than a nominal property  in short madam continued he though i have been a soldier i am not so much inclined to cutting of throats as to deliver you from sir williams tyranny merely to leave you at liberty to bestow yourself on lord lucan but if you will condescend to make a concession to the warmth of that passion your charms have inspired me with i will protect you from your husband and the whole world beside at the hazard of my life and fortune  in love at least i am a swiss and will not fight without pay  remember madam that you are much more in my power than i am in yours and that if you should attempt to raise sir williams resentment toward me i can with the greatest ease return it upon yourself  this picture madam   restore it sir this moment  on certain terms you may command it madam  what are they  make me as happy as you have made the original of it and all my future life shall be devoted to you  hear me sir while i call heaven to witness that lord lucan never solicited a criminal indulgence from me and that my heart has never yet admitted a thought that could reflect dishonor on my husband  yet criminal to him and heaven i am perhaps for having yielded a secret though involuntary preference to another object  the punishment of this my greatest guilt i now receive from you and if there be a spark of honor or humanity remaining in your breast you will not only cease to persecute an unhappy woman who has confessed her weakness to you but convert the unworthy passion you have dared to urge to pity  alas i dare not say esteem  he was silent i ventured to look up and through the dim medium of my tears i thought he seemed affected  charming angelic tyrant he exclaimed o were that tender weakness you have now avowed but felt for me how should i worship even that false delicacy which deems it criminal  but it is deceitful all  lord lucan madam has solicited  never never sir  recall the morning scene at waltersburgh  conviction flashed upon me at the instant and resentment hurried me beyond all tamer considerations  i do sir and am now convinced you were the person who then insulted me  you only could have had the presumption to attempt so base an outrage and your knowing it has now revealed the mystery you were the audacious monster who violated at once the laws of decency and hospitality would to heaven my death had been the consequence but let what will happen now i will no longer hold a moments parley with you  i strove at that instant to rush out of the temple but he prevented me by seizing one of my hands and saying i plead guilty madam but be assured i never should have made so daring an essay but that i thought in such a situation lord lucan might have succeeded a thousand circumstances concurred to make me think so i looked upon the straining of his leg as a contrivance to excuse his going out with the rest of the hunters that he might spend his time more happily with you  and had it been so could you blame me madam my love my admiration are as strong as his  detested love detested admiration was all that i could utter  i know it madam  then leave me sir this moment  not till you have pardoned a fault for which i never can forgive myself as it has distressed or offended you  on one condition i will pardon you sir and on no other  name it madam  that you shall never presume to hint your hateful passion more  impossible as well not bid me breathe but let not your sentence be too severe for i have terms to make as well as you  suppose that i    at that instant i heard the footsteps of a person running toward the temple it was harriet who came to tell me that her uncle was arrived  gracious heaven i exclaimed in a low voice what will become of me the colonel replied in the same tone rely upon my friendship and be happy  harriet looked amazed but with the utmost tenderness begged that i would compose myself as she was sure sir william would be shocked were he to see my agitation  not if he knew the cause said colonel walter i stared upon him wildly he proceeded lady barton has had a fall and sprained her ancle the shock has hurried her spirits and i was this moment going to the house to order the cabriole to bring her home  harriet looked as if she doubted but took the hint and said you had best do so sir and let my uncle know of the accident as it will account for my aunts delay  i was silent yet sure my situation was truly pitiable in being reduced to the sad dilemma either of joining in a deceit with a person whom i detested or of exposing myself to the prying eyes of my husband under such circumstances as must alarm him and call for explanation  the colonel then turned to me and said is it your pleasure madam that i should go  yes yes was all that i could utter and the moment he was gone burst again into a passion of tears upon which harriet cried out why is not lucy here i have no influence upon my aunt i am not worthy to advise  you are you are my dear what would you have me do  have pity on sir william and yourself and try to calm your spirits for sure he never will believe they could be ruffled thus by so slight an accident  believe me madam i would lay down my life to make you happy though that is but a small compliment for it is of very little value to myself she turned aside to hide a starting tear  i clasped her to my breast and said do not my harriet add to my distress by suffering me to think you are unhappy  sir william and the cabriole came together he embraced me very affectionately and rallied me on my cowardice in being so affected by my fall wanted much to see my ancle which i declined took me up in his arms and seated me in the chair walked by my side till we got to the house and again lifted me out of it into my dressing room  o think my sister what i then endured but you can never know it deceit has ever been a stranger to your heart and the sharp stings of self contempt have never entered there  benson flew to me with arquebusade vinegar etc the consciousness of the mean part i then acted rendered me peevish and i hastily bid her leave the room  i blushed as the words escaped me  was it her fault that i was become contemptible  when she was gone out harriet said i fear madam you are much hurt indeed  yes harriet to the heart i sunk down upon the couch and covered my face with my handkerchief  she threw herself at my feet and without attempting to pry into the cause implored me to let her put a bandage round my ancle lest sir william should be alarmed at my supposed obstinacy and send for a surgeon  this i refused and on the instant resolved to extricate myself from the hateful appearance of having entered into a mean collusion with colonel walter i rang the bell for benson and assuming as cheerful a countenance as i could put on told her that i had not received any hurt that required particular application and that time should be my only physician  i then dressed myself as usual and when the last dinner bell rung i desired harriet to accompany me to the parlour  sir william seemed surprised at seeing me walk and said he was just then coming to assist me or as the old ballad said to take up his load of vanity  when i sat down to table i found myself extremely ill  i tried to eat but in vain  i soon retired after dinner and sat down to write this account of my mortification to you  it is now eight of clock and i can no longer support the violent pain in my head or hold the pen   adieu adieu my sister my friend my confident l barton ps by whom or how contrived the picture had been laid on the table in the temple i cannot guess nor know i yet through what medium to inquire about it    letter xliv lady barton to miss cleveland many days have elapsed since i concluded my last letter to my fanny some of them have passed like the arrow that flies through the air and leaves no trace behind  would i had accompanied their flight but alas it will not be and by the same almighty fiat which first called me into being i am again recalled from the confines of eternity  may that gracious power that has been pleased to prolong my existence endue me with resignation to his allwise decrees  i am at present but ill able to write the account i can give you of myself must therefore be short but it will tell my sister that i live and notwithstanding my desiring her to forget me i still flatter myself that my life is of consequence to her happiness  the moment i had sealed my last letter to you i found myself unable to sit up and went to bed but not to rest about eleven sir william came into my chamber and on finding me extremely feverish muttered something about fine ladies being always vapourish or indisposed and wished me a good night  never was health more sincerely welcomed by a dying wretch than sickness was now by me  i hoped i trusted i should be released and invoked the king of terrors with the unhappy constance  oh amiable lovely death  arise forth from thy couch of lasting night  thou hate and terror to prosperity  come grin on me and i will think thou smilest  and kiss thee as thy wife miserys love  oh come to me   in this manner did i pass the night rejoicing in the increase of my disorder till the delirium which it brought on rendered me insensible to it and every thing else for five days i continued in a state of mental annihilation the return of my reason was like the appearance of an ignis fatuus it glimmered and vanished several times as if unwilling to return to the wretched habitation which it had forsaken  harriet my beloved my gentle harriet whose tenderness and attention to me has been unremitted assures me that sir william was much afflicted during my illness and that though colonel walter endeavored to console him yet he also appeared much affected and quitted the house the next day  may the miseries which he has brought upon me make a proper impression on his heart and turn his detested passion into contrition for his crimes and compassion for the sufferings of his injured wife as soon as i was pronounced out of danger sir william went to visit a distant part of his estate where he is establishing a manufacture  he has been gone ten days and in that time i think both my mind and body have acquired strength perhaps it is owing to the weakness of the latter that the former is more composed but i will endeavor to enjoy the temporary calm though i fear that the storm has only subsided and may perhaps return with double fury to wreck this feeble bark  be that as it may i shall ever remain  your truly affectionate sister l barton ps where and how is mrs walter assure her of my kindest remembrance her sufferings are so deeply engraved on my heart that not even my own can efface them  happy fanny that have been able to mitigate even a part of her sorrows by removing the bitter pangs of maternal anxiety for the fate of a beloved child    letter xlv miss cleveland to lady barton paris the seeing my letter dated from this place will in some measure account to my dear louisa for my silence at a time when she stood most in need of every consolation that friendship could bestow on a tenderly beloved and suffering sister  i am however selfish enough to rejoice that i was unacquainted with the danger that threatened your life till it was past for i had the painful pleasure of receiving both your letters on my arrival here last night  truly distressing and affecting as they are my head is at present so filled with the extraordinary events which have happened within a very short space that though my heart is truly sensible of your afflictions i find it impossible to give its feelings vent till i have informed you of a circumstance which i am certain will afford you the sincerest pleasure  delia my brothers beloved delia delia colville lives as zanga says first recover that and then you shall hear further  our good angel our dear mrs walter received a letter from pere guillaume about the middle of last month acquainting her that he would meet her at calais and attend her to what part of france she pleased but were he to recommend any particular convent it should be les dames ursulines at st omers as the superior was his near relation and particular friend  this reeommendation was perfectly agreeable to mrs walter for many reasons the vicinity of st omers to england was perhaps the strongest as it flattered her with the hopes of seeing me at some time or other if she lived and rendered the immediate removal of her daughter convenient in case of her death  i accompanied her to dover and feared that i had taken my last farewell of my amiable friend when i saw her embark for calais  i heard from her in a few days after our parting and she was not worse  i had then determined to spend the remainder of the summer at clevelandhall in executing some little romantic plans of improvement in order to amuse myself and surprise sir george at his return from italy which he had promised should be before winter but a second letter from mrs walter afforded me an opportunity of surprising him indeed she told me that in the convent where she then resided there was a very beautiful young english lady who went by the name of wilson who upon having seen the address of her letter to me as it went to the tour in order to be sent to the post office implored her permission to speak to her in private that some time had elasped before she could find an opportunity and when she did she informed her that her name was colville delia colville i again repeat it that she had been placed there by her mother without her knowledge or consent who had desired that she might be closely confined debarred the use of pen and ink and prevented from even going into the parlour or conversing with any of the pensioners as she was represented to be so artful that she would corrupt and impose on them by the insincere plausibility of her manners and was actually upon the point of disgracing her family by a shameful connection with a man of inferior rank and fortune  that in consequence of this cruel aspersion she had been treated with the utmost severity that the rules of the convent would admit of and that from the time of her entrance till that moment she had never heard from her mother or any other person whatsoever  she then blushing mentioned sir george cleveland and said she had long vainly flattered herself that he would have sought her out and released her from so inquitous and cruel a confinement but that if even he had forgotten and forsaken her she was convinced that his sisters humanity would interest itself in behalf of an oppressed and injured person whom she had once honored with the name of friend  she added that the mildness of her temper and the perfect acquiescence she had shown under the severe restraints that were imposed on her had influenced the nuns to treat her with less harshness than at first and that she had been lately allowed the honor of conversing with the superior but that the moment she attempted to justify herself from her mothers slander she was enjoined silence and obliged to retire to her cell after having this reflection urged against her that it must be always more natural to suppose children to be undutiful or ungrateful than that parents should be unkind or unjust this maxim is certainly true in general but there are sometimes instances which occur in life that baffle all philosophy with regard to the human mind  o my louisa does not your heart grieve for the sufferings of the innocent and unoffending delia when mrs walter promised her to acquaint me with her situation she cried out it is enough i know miss cleveland i shall be released yet sure sir george will at least accompany his sister if she should come to take me out of my confinement and i shall see him once again  mrs walter told her she believed that would be impossible for  she interrupted her by exclaiming is he married if he is i may as well stay here miss clevelands kindness will be useless to me  on mrs walters telling her that he was in italy and not married she kissed her hand and bathed it with her tears and said do not despise me madam for loving the most amiable of men  he is the counterpart of your miss cleveland and if you knew him you would love him also  the moment i received mrs walters letter i went immediately to councellor w  to know what were the proper and legal steps to be taken for the recovery of my beloved delia he told me he would wait on the lord chancellor next day and furnish me with proper powers to compel mrs colville to produce her daughter in the chancerychamber who as a minor was to be considered as a ward of the court though the guardianship of her person and fortune had been before granted to her detestable mother  i then returned home wrote to mrs walter and enclosed a few lines to delia entreating her to keep up her spirits till i could effect her release which i promised to do with the utmost expedition  i ordered my clothes to be packed up and a chaise with four horses to be in readiness the next day and the moment counselor w  furnished me with my instructions i set out for dover accompanied by my maid and two men servants  there was a messenger dispatched at the same time with his lordships order to mrs colville but if she should not be found or should abscond upon receiving it i am to apply to lord h  our ambassador in france whom i have the honor of being very well acquainted with to procure a special mandate from the court of versailles for her release  i wrote to my brother who is now at naples in a very ambiguous style hinting as if i had heard some vague report of delias being alive for i durst not trust him with the mighty joy at once as i have been told that the sudden effects of that passion have sometimes been as fatal in their consequences as those of grief  i then informed him of my intention of going to paris and said as i knew all places were indifferent to him i hoped he would have galantry enough to meet me there as the pleasure i promised myself in seeing him was the principal cause of my undertaking the journey  the moment of my arrival at st omers i was met by mrs walter i need not describe to you the effects of our interview  i flatter myself that she looks better than she did she says the joy she feels at having been though accidentally the instrument of good to the amiable delia has roused her spirits from the torpid state they had continued in while she considered herself but as an useless burden or at best an insignificant blank in life  she told me she had not had an opportunity of seeing miss colville since she received my letter but at prayers that she had endeavored to render her looks as expressive as possible by the cheerfulness of her air and that delia seemed to understand the hint in her favor she advised me not to go to the convent as it was certain that i should not be permitted to see miss colville and her hearing that i had been there might throw her off her guard so far as to alarm the nuns and make them confine her still more closely or perhaps tranfer her as is sometimes the case over to some other convent  i was convinced by her reasons and restraining my fond impatience i set out the next morning for paris where i arrived last night and have the mortification to learn this morning that mrs colville is gone to toulouse as it is thought to settle there  the lord chancellors messenger is gone off post to her and here must i remain till his return  and now let me assure my louisa that not even the joy i feel at the certainty of delias restoration can prevent me for a moment from sympathizing in the tenderest manner with her distress the circumstances of which are certainly equally difficult and mortifying  there never was any thing so unfortunately critical as your situation with that vile walter when sir williams arrival was announced the snare as you say seemed contrived by fate  i honor your struggling through it and not leting the wretch triumph in the success of his scheme which he certainly would have done had you carried on the deceit beyond the moment that it was absolutely necessary  i am grieved but not surprised at the effect which the anguish of your mind has had upon your constitution and am i hope truly thankful for your recovery  and may it be a perfect one  surely louisa you ought to think lord lucan to blame with regard to the picture he must have hazarded your reputation by making a confidante of the person who placed it on your table can it be possible that the enamoured harriet can have verified nay exceeded the romantic ideas of submissive tenderness which prior has given us in the character of his emma  i know not what to think but if harriet be indeed the confidante of lord lucan she claims the highest degree of admiration that the strongest fortitude joined with the tenderest sensibility can possibly excite  but this character comprehends perhaps something more than woman do not be outdone by her my sister but strive to emulate the virtue which you must admire  were you to look minutely into the situation of my heart you would find that i can practice as well as preach for though i perhaps may never be entirely able to eradicate all traces of my weakness for lord hume i have by a kind of discipline more severe than any in the romish church conquered my desire of speaking of him nor do i allow even my thoughts the fond though sad indulgence of contemplating either his faults or merits for the moment his idea obtrudes itself upon my mind i snatch up a book or pen and drive him directly from that place which he was not worthy to inhabit  take notice that the poets are banished out of my library and that my present studies are of the reasoning kind and call for all my attention  i wish you could be prevailed upon to try this recipe  for indeed i am for many reasons more anxious for your recovery even than for my own my malady can only injure an individual and that myself yours like a contagion must be fatal to many  stop the infection then before it spreads and you will hereafter reflect with pleasure that so many persons who are and ought to be dear to you are indebted for their happiness to your virtue  i am convinced that this sentiment will have more weight with you than any selfish consideration could for full well i know the nobleness of my louisas nature  i was much pleased with sir williams behavior on account of your supposed lameness and still more so with your candor in relating it to me as there is no doubt but that his kindness must have luckily increased your own selfcondemnation  i wish harriet would make you the confidante of her innocent passion for lord lucan as your tenderness for her joined to your own delicacy would then restrain you from the too dangerous indulgence of talking of him at least before her and i should then wish that she might not be a moment out of your sight  forgive me my ever dear and amiable sister for presuming to dictate to a heart and understanding like yours but the greatest physician will not prescribe for himself when sick and will even condescend to take the advice of a person whose skill he knows to be inferior to his own  all i can plead in favor of my present prescription is that i have tried it myself with success and that it is recommended to you by the warmest affection of  f cleveland  letter xlvi lord hume to lord lucan naples i verily believe my dear lucan that there never was a more unfortunate kinghterrant than myself and that the renowned hero of la mancha was but a prototype both of my folly and my sufferings i think i want nothing but a squire as tristful as yourself to record my misadventures in the style of a ballad called the disastrous traveller or lord humes garland  which would certainly supersede the babes in the wood and barbara allen in the english chronicle and set all the nurserymaids and children in our nation ablubbering  my last informed you how completely i was duped at venice that i had lost my mistress and my money bagatelles not worth thinking of say you cheaply off for some thousands etc etc  well philosophy is a fine thing said i to myself and i will endeavor to think like lord lucan  but i had better have recollected the famous sentence recorded to have been uttered from the pulpit by an irish bishop who by the way was an englishman and prepared myself for what was to follow  single misfortunes said his reverence never come alone and the greatest of evils is attended by greater  now to apply my text  in a very ill temper and with about a hundred pieces in my pocket i set out from venice and journeying by land and by water arrived safe in the ecclesiastical territories about two leagues from tivoli my carriage broke down i had no attendants but one servant who sat in the carriage with me and very ill supplied the place of my former fellowtraveller i had left one footman sick at venice who was to follow me and discharged all the rest of my useless parade  i did not choose to leave my baggage to the care or rather mercy of the postilion and as it was not quite dark i ordered saunders you know old robert to stay by the chaise till i could send people from tivoli either to mend it or assist him to bring my trunks to some place of safety  i had not walked half a league when i was attacked by banditti who demanded my purse and on my attempting to make some resistance as i wore a couteau de chasse they knocked me down gave me several cuts over the head stripped me of my money clothes and watch and left me for dead on the spot  as it grew late saunders became alarmed for my safety and tried to prevail on the postilion to let him have one of the horses in order to overtake and guard me on the road to the town the fellow either was or pretended to be afraid to stay by himself they therefore mounted the pair and set out together for tivoli  as i was left directly in the highway the horses started as they came up to me and when the men alighted to see what was the matter they found me weltering in my blood but with so much appearance of life that i still breathed and sometimes groaned  poor old saunders tore off his shirt to bind up my wounds as well as he could in the dark and covered me with his own clothes while the postilion rode off in search of a surgeon and a litter to convey me to some shelter  my senses did not return till the next day when i found myself covered with bandages and so faint and weak with loss of blood that i could not speak saunders gave a scream of joy at seeing me open my eyes and recounted what had befallen me  i lay in this state of misery above three weeks and when i was able to rise i had not a single garment of any sort to put on for the postilion i presume considering that i should have no further occasion for them had assumed to himself the office of an executor and carried off my baggage with the chaise and horses and got clear out of his holinesss dominions before there was any inquiry made after him  i sent saunders off immediately to rome with a draught on my banker which he received and returned as quick as possible but i was still unable to travel and a wound which i had received in my right arm prevented my being able to use a pen without suffering extremely  let this account for your not hearing from me during my confinement  as i had a good deal of leisure to reflect upon my own folly i determined to grow wise incontinently and thought the best proof i could give of my discretion was to turn my steps toward england  i was however obliged to go to rome for a few days to settle with my banker  as soon as my business was dispatched i set out in pursuance of my plan and have arrived thus far on my route over  i went as was natural to the house where i had formerly lived with margarita and could not help making some inquiries after her to my great surprise they told me that she was then in this city and lived in a most exemplary manner with an ecclesiastic who was believed to be her brother  a spirit of revenge took possession of me the moment that i heard of this pretended priest and brother and i determined to see my fallen angel upbraid her with her perfidy and punish the villain who had robbed me of my mistress and cheated me of my money  i wandered about naples for several days without being able to discover any trace of her at last i bethought myself of visiting the churches for as she now pretended to be a devotee i might possibly meet her in one of them  accordingly i one day saw a woman kneeling at a confessional who though she was veiled i immediately knew to be margarita  i waited for a long time before she had concluded her devotions and joined her just as she was going out of the porch when i spoke to her she lifted up her veil and looked at me with a countenance so full of sweetness that i instantly forgot my resentment and could have fallen at her feet and entreated her to be reconciled to me  she spoke to me in a low voice and said i have used you ill my lord but i have been severely punished for my crime i dare not hope you should again receive me into your favor but come and accept of all the restitution that is now in my power to make you i live in the strada del santo marco my tyrant will be asleep by eleven oclock i shall then at least have an opportunity of imploring your forgiveness  i dare not talk to you longer adieu  despise me as you will lucan i confess that i felt my tenderness for this infamous woman revive and instead of going directly to a magistrate or endeavoring to do myself justice on her and her vile accomplice i counted the minutes with impatient expectation of that happy one which should again restore me to the pleasure of seeing and conversing with her  at the time appointed i repaired to my rendezvous which was at a considerable distance from the place where i lived and in a very retired part of the town as i passed through an unfrequented street i was set upon by four bravos i instantly drew my sword and determined to sell my life as dear as possible  as i had the advantage of a wall at my back i defended myself successfully for a few minutes but should have been overpowered if providence had not sent sir george cleveland and another gentleman to my rescue at their approach the bravoes would have fled but i secured one of them whom i had wounded and who proved to be the pretended priest and brother of margarita  when we had lodged him properly and i had got a slight wound which i had received dressed i communicated the whole of my adventure frankly to sir george and wished him to accompany me in pursuit of that worthless woman whom i supposed to be an accomplice in the intended assassination and whom i now resolved to give up to justice  sir george is a gallant fellow lucan he talked so very rationally that he dissuaded me from my purpose as he said the bringing margarita to punishment if i should have resolution sufficient to do so must of necessity expose myself observing also that i ought not to pursue a wretch with too much rigor whom i had formerly contributed to render abandoned  his remarks upon the folly and baseness of men in their commerce with the unhappy of the other sex were truly generous  i remember but one of them at present i think he said that we first take pains to destroy the foundation of every female virtue modesty and are then surprised to find the superstructure totter  that is foolish enough to be sure though we practice it every day  but to conclude for i begin to think you are heartily tired as even i grow a little weary though i am talking of myself which is the pleasantest of all subjects  the next morning brought me a most doleful letter from my fair penitent entreating me for the love i once bore her not to prosecute her brother as she still affected to style him declaring herself entirely innocent of any evil intentions of his with regard to my life and offering to refund whatever remained of the jewels she had robbed me of provided i would but remit the prosecution  i consulted with cleveland who advised me not to be prevailed on to suffer such a pest to society as pere jacques to escape but if he would give up his accomplices to use my interest to get them all sent to the galleys together as to la bella signora he thought i should make terms with her also and let her compound for her crimes by a life of repentance  that the jewels she mentioned should be sold in order to pay her pension among les filles repenties where she should be obliged to enter on her probation immediately  i was charmed with this scheme and by his assistance have happily put it in execution  would he could be as successful in restoring me to the esteem of an amiable woman as he has been in extricating me from the artifices of a vile one  but i have never yet dared to name miss cleveland to him and i will patiently go through a year of probation under his eye before i even presume to hope that he will favor my suit  in the mean time i am happy to find from his behavior that he is a stranger to mine upon that occasion  he talks of returning to england in a few months  i am determined to accompany him and i hope that you will have got so far the better of your romantic passion by that time as to quit your sorrowful solitude and meet us there  here ends my woeful story which however has had a fortunate conclusion may all your adventures terminate as happily sincerely wishes your  affectionate friend hume ps i have this moment received a billet from sir george cleveland acquainting me that he means to set out immediately for paris  this is a sudden flight but i am determined to accompany him direct to me accordingly    letter xlvii lord lucan to lord hume my dear hume i sincerely congratulate you on the operatical denouement of your italian comedy and think that even metastasio has not wound up any of his catastrophes with more poetical justice than you have shown in the disposal of your dramatis personae  but the most enviable part of your good fortune is the having met with such a friend as sir george cleveland whose knowledge of the world joined to an excellent understanding and an amiable heart all which he has shown in the management of your affair with margarita must render him at once an object of your affection and respect and afford you an opportunity of benefiting both by his precepts and example  i have not the honor of knowing sir george but have heard his character description and story he is neither older wiser nor better principled than you are to what then are we to impute the difference between the preceptor and the pupil to nothing more than a circumstance which i am glad to lay hold of for your instruction he had conceived a strong but chaste passion for a woman of merit whose name i know not than which nothing in nature more elevates the mind improves the understanding refines the manners and purges the affections of man his mistress is dead i hear lately but the influence of virtue reaches beyond the grave for a heart once rendered pure like a transmuted metal can never degenerate into its original baseness again  i have often thought that many of the errors of our young men of quality are owing to a wrong choice of the governors to whom they are entrusted at the most critical era of their lives when their passions are strongest and their judgment weakest  i mean when they are thought old enough to be sent abroad for improvement and not deemed wise enough to conduct themselves  fathers and guardians on this occasion generally fix on some person of learning which by the ignorant is frequently mistaken for sense as what is called a liberal education is as falsely and frequently supposed to be as synonimous with a liberal mind  the greatest blockheads i have ever known have been bred in college  neither absurdity nor meanness prevent a man from becoming master of a language nor of arriving at a competent knowledge in any particular branch of science  but these are not the qualifications necessary to form a noble mind and yet an ignorant pedant is not only the first person from whom we receive the rudiments of education but is too often the last to whose final care we are consigned to receive that fine polish to which our mind and manners owe their most distinguished luster  that moral enamel which both brightens and preserves  if i should ever be happy enough to see a son of mine at a fit age to send abroad i shall endeavor to find out a governor for him qui a vecu i mean one who with a complete experience of the world has both sense and virtue sufficient to detest vice admire virtue and yield indulgence to the foibles and irregularities of youth and inexperience whose morality should exceed  the fixed and settled rules  of vice and virtue in the schools and whose principles of religion though perfectly conformable to our established mode of worship should with regard to the best characteristic of it know no difference of sect but extend itself to the outermost line of the great circle of charity which embraces all mankind  you will perhaps say that i have drawn an ideal character like that of a patriot king  it may be so but the person i should select for such a purpose of entering a young man of rank or fortune into the world at large should be some reduced officer whose humanity had been rather softened than hardened by danger and disappointment one who had been trained up in the school of honor which may be styled the true sublime of morals  and such a guardian preceptor or passport through life i should prefer to the whole conclave of parsons out of which class of men are too generally chosen the bearleaders to our modern cubs of quality  so much for governors  i think you judge rightly in not mentioning miss cleveland to sir george while your amor with margarita is so recent  there is something extremely indelicate in professing a passion for a virtuous woman before we have undergone a sufficient quarantine after the contagion of an abandoned one  a man in such a situation resembles a centaur half human half brute  or at best he can but say with cyruss friend araspes i have two souls sir george is too good a judge of human nature not to excuse your infatuation in favor of an artful beauty but how shall miss cleveland be reconciled to your infidelity or on what security shall she rest her hope that you may not be subject to a second delirium indeed my dear hume a year is too short for a term of probation or rather of atonement though you were to spend it in the severe penance which your prototype don quixote endured for the disenchantment of dulcinea upon the black mountain  by the way i think the constancy and sufferings of that renowned knight bear a much greater similitude to my sufferings than to yours for i do not find that you resemble him in any point but your misadventures which like his were the natural and necessary consequences of madness enthusiasm and folly  i hope i may venture to say this without offense as you have so seriously declared your determination of becoming wise incontinently  if any thing could have tempted me to leave ireland at present it would have been to meet you in london but as you have now a much stronger inducement than my company to urge your return i shall remain in what you call my sorrowful solitude as it is now not only become pleasant but dear to me for solitude is sometimes the nurse of contentment as well as of woe  from this hint you will conclude my heart to be more at ease than when i wrote last to you and your conclusion will be just  it is indeed much more at ease yet more anxious still  love deals in contradictions you see  i shall now conclude with subscribing myself my dear humes  affectionate friend and servant lucan  letter xlviii lord hume to lord lucan paris i tell you lucan there is no such thing as resisting fate  here am i with as good and sober dispositions as any man of two and twenty in europe for ever getting into some scrape or other without temptation or excuse or even knowing how or why i became engaged well then a knight errant i certainly am of natures own dubbing and i will now courteously relate to you myself for want of a squire my new achievement  but first i must acquaint you that ever since our arrival here sir george cleveland has been so totally taken up with some private business of his own that poor melancholy i have been left to the pleasant amusement of contemplating my own extravagance and folly which has you know deprived me of the happiness of seeing or conversing with his charming sister who has met him here and as i quitted naples almost at a minutes warning i left old robert to pack up my clothes and bring them after me  in this situation i could not possibly make my appearance in public or even venture to visit any of my quondam acquaintance in my travellingdress  i spent two days tout seul and found an unlucky truth that any company would be less dull to me than my own  on this discovery i sallied forth and in sauntering along the boulevard i happened to meet jack wilson of the guards who is as dissipated a genius as myself i proposed to him our going to dine at some of the environs of paris to which he readily agreed  a chaise was ordered directly we drove of to noisy le sec  we walked about while dinner was preparing and at a little distance observed a castle defended by a deep moat great iron gates a drawbridge and immense high walls  the appearance of this extraordinary mansion roused my chivalry i figured to myself a beauteous damsel confined there by some horrid enchanter or giant and determined that i would if possible set the fair captive free wilson laughed at my romantic ideas but they had taken too strong possession of me to be easily baffled  when we returned to our inn we inquired from our host who were the inhabitants of that gothic fortress  he told us they were two very beautiful young ladies of high birth and large fortunes who being determined never to marry yet disliking the severities of a convent had chose to seclude themselves from the world in that retirement  he added that the curiosity of all the neighboring gentry was so highly raised that many attempts had been made to get a sight of these fair recluses but in vain for no mortal had ever seen them since their arrival there though it was known they walked in their gardens every day  curiosity began now to operate upon wilson as much as romance had done before on me and we resolved that we would take a peep at these voluntary votaries of madam diana coute qui coute  many and various were the schemes which we framed and rejected for the gratification of our idle and impertinent inquisitiveness during the course of that night we lay in the same room in order to continue our consultations but when the dawn appeared we were just as undetermined on what method to pursue as we were at the moment we lay down  we rose and called our host into council who assured us that the castle was inaccessible unless we were mad enough to venture our lives by swimming over a deep fosse which defended it in front or scrambling through a thicket of briars which prevented our approach on the other side and that if we should even be able to subdue these difficulties there was still an immense high wall to climb which no man could get over without hazarding life or limb  opposition but increased our ardor and we at last resolved to attempt the thicket in preference to the fosse as we thought we should make a better appearance in the eyes of these supposed charmers even with our clothes torn than after emerging dripping wet out of a dirty ditch  and by the way lucan i think that all the water in and about paris wants washing as was said once by a witty friend of mine i never saw such a muddy puddle in my life as their boasted seine  the yellow tiber or the bristol severn are crystal to it  i will not detain you by repeating the fatigues and difficulties we suffered in this attempt suffice it to say that our clothes were torn and our hands legs and faces as much scratched as if we had made a party on the pantiles with a groupe of amorous tabbies  but what are not patience and perseverance able to subdue  in short we scaled the walls and seated ourselves in a good pleasant arbor in a corner of the garden valuing ourselves on our heroic achievement and impatiently expecting the reward of our toils by being blessed at last with a view of these fair vestals  in a short time after we had made our lodgment in this redoubt to our inexpressible delight we heard the sound of female voices talking in a cheerful lively tone and soon saw two ladies walking toward us down an alley that fronted the harbor we were in  but no language will ever be able to describe our amazement when the speakers had advanced near enough to be clearly seen and distinctly heard by us  no idea either of venus or the graces or diana and her nymphs will suit the description  but if you can rumage up any recollection of cybele or for that matter you need not go so far back as mother shipton will serve as well to represent the two old hags that appeared then before us  it must be enchantment said i to wilson  he replied i see nothing enchanting about them they are both ugly and old  no woman is old in france remember that wilson or at least let us endeavor to persuade these grannams that we think so for civility is the only passport by which we can hope to get over the drawbridge in safety  when they approached the arbor perceiving us they started too in their turn and would have fled back if their old shanks had been supple enough to have corresponded with their fears but we soon quieted their apprehensions by the mildness of our demeanor and the frank confession we made of the romantic curiosity which had prompted us to this frolic  being thus recovered from this alarm they both laughed immoderately at the awkward confusion which appeared in our faces and one of them addressing us with infinite good humor and vivacity said we are extremely obliged to you gentlemen or rather courteous knights for the perils you have encountered for our sakes and also for convincing us that the noble spirit of chivalry is not yet quite extinct in the world believe me we wish rather more earnestly than you that we were possessed of those charms which you expected to have met with in this galant adventure but youth and beauty are transitory things and with them we have lost the admiration of your sex and merely in sport had yet a mind to try if it was not still in our power to occasion a disappointment as great though not indeed so severe as any young and beautiful coquette might make her lover feel if i may judge by your countenances i think we have so far succeeded and the only amends we can make you for having sped our frolic is to desire the favor of your company to dinner and to promise to convey you back again by a shorter and pleasanter road than you came to noisy le sec without any further damages than what the view of our persons seems already to have made you pay for your peeping  you may suppose how confoundedly silly wilson and i looked all this while but i was so much pleased with the spirit and good humor of this lively dowager that i wished her thirty years younger entirely for her own sake we accepted her invitation with the best grace we could and entered into a very cheerful conversation with them both during which they discovered that we were englishmen and informed us that they were our countrywomen the one who seemed to take the lead in every thing is a sister of lord d  s and had been while she lived in england an intimate acquaintance of my mothers  who the other lady was did not transpire  before we parted wilson and i both promised her not to disclose their secrets if she chose to carry on the jest for any further time but she gave us leave to publish it to our friends if we pleased as she meant to quit that place immediately said she and her companion were both tired of their voluntary confinement and did not believe that if they were to remain there seven years longer any frenchman would ever give himself as much trouble about them as we had had done  i charged myself with some commissions pour mes belles antiques which i shall execute in england with the most knightly punctuality imaginable and returned laughing to paris about an hour ago  robert is arrived with my baggage i shall dress and go to the comedy though i believe it will be near over before i get there  as i am resolved to attend sir george clevelands motions and that he seems to be upon the wing i shall not expect to hear from you while i remain upon the continent but hope to find a packet from you at my arrival in old england till then adieu my dear lucan says  yours hume  letter xlix lady barton to miss cleveland southfield pleasure joy they are both inadequate to what i feel from your account of delia colville my brother my beloved my happy brother what will his transports be he may certainly say with lord townly long parted friends that pass through common voyages in life receive but common gladness at their meeting  but from a shipwreck saved we mingle tears with our embraces and surely the recovery i might almost say the resurrection of the beloved and lamented delia is a still higher cause for rapture  i should fear for his life or senses if this secret was in any other hands but yours  yet even for you i think it will be a difficult task to moderate his ecstasy  were i now to meet him i should fly into his arms and cry out she lives i know you will not do so but though you may restrain your tongue will not your eyes betray the mighty joy will they not sparkle with unusual luster and speak of delia colville mine do so at this moment though their weak beams have long been quenched in tears  i wait impatiently for another letter from you  do but tell me they have met and my mind will be at peace for i shall then suppose that naught but death can part them  i do not wish to mix one gloomy line with this joyful subject i shall therefore say little of myself  i am recovering from my late illness though slowly sir william is returned in an alarming state he fell from his horse about a fortnight ago his physician apprehends that he has received some inward hurt as he spits blood ever since  my attention to him is unremitted he seems pleased with it and i begin once more to flatter myself that my fannys prediction may yet be verified  colonel walter has renewed his visit and made several attempts to speak to me alone which i have happily evaded for when i am absent from sir william i take care to keep harriet constantly with me  i perceive he is mortified at my caution in which however i am determined to persevere  last night when our letters came from the post the colonel took them from the servant and conveyed one out of his pocket into the parcel quick as his motions were this action did not escape me and the moment i had received those that were addressed to me i retired and immediately enclosed the letter which bore no post mark on it in a blank cover directed to the colonel and ordered it to be instantly delivered to him when i returned into the parlour to supper there were strong traces of resentment in his countenance and he talked rather at than to me for the remainder of the evening  this morning he went from hence before i was up  surely he will at length desist from an hopeless pursuit  twice have his detested and unsuccessful attempts brought me near the grave  heaven preserve me from a third i shudder at the bare apprehension  your wishes with regard to my becoming harriets confidante are almost accomplished for she has confessed to me that she corresponded with lord lucan during my illness and also that she concealed my danger from him as she judged what his sufferings would be on that occasion by her own  was ever any thing more truly delicate than her endeavoring to save him pain  she offered to show me his letters i refused to see them and told her i had no doubt of his friendship for me or the propriety and politeness of his manners toward her but that i could not help observing to her as a friend without the authority of a parent that i feared there was something inconsistent with the strict rules of decorum in her carrying on such a correspondence  she blushed extremely and i could perceive there was something more still laboring in her artless bosom  lord lucans picture came into my thoughts at the same time yet i had not resolution sufficient to ask her a single question relative to it  after a minutes silence i saw that her face was bathed with tears she caught my hand and said i have been much more imprudent madam than you yet know of but if you will be my friend indeed  alas i have no other and conceal what is past from my uncle i will tell you all my folly and submit my future conduct to your direction  i gave her every possible assurance that the tenderest friendship could suggest and i know not which of us was most agitated during this scene  she owned her having lent my picture to lord lucan at his most earnest entreaty on condition that he should give her his that he had kept his promise but that she had been so unfortunate as to lose his gift and that she had lived in perpetual apprehension ever since lest any accident might betray this act of indiscretion to her uncle or to me  but that she still more dreaded its injuring lord lucan by raising a suspicion of his being her lover when heaven and she could tell he had not such a thought  her color rose to crimson as she pronounced the last sentence with clasped hands and streaming eyes  i never beheld a more animated figure  generous harriet i said softly to myself and my heart reverberated the sound  what pains has it cost her to defend the fidelity of the man she loves to her rival  yes fanny i will emulate the virtue i admire every effort of my life shall be exerted to promote harriets happiness and from that pure and unsullied source i will endeavor to derive my own  i confess i am pleased at being able to acquit lord lucan of the indiscretion of having made a confidante his picture must have fallen into the hands of colonel walter when harriet lost it and the vile artful wretch contrived to place it as a snare for me and watched the moment  how to recover it for the innocent owner is now the question i cannot think of any prudent and therefore possible means of effecting this at present i can neither ask it as a favor with a safe condescension nor demand it as a right without danger  the variety of distressful subjects with which my late letters have been filled have so much engrossed my thoughts while writing to you that i have never mentioned a circumstance which has given me sincere satisfaction the recovery of mr creswell lucy leisters lover  his father is since dead by which he is now become sir harry creswell  ma chere amie est au comble de ses voeux but delays the completion both of her own and her lovers happiness till i am able to be present at the joining of those hands whose hearts have long been united  sir williams indisposition prevents me from having their nuptials celebrated here as the custom of this country would on that occasion require such an exertion of what is called hospitality which is another term for drinking as might be prejudicial to him and my attendance on him restrains me from going up to dublin to her so that our wishes alone can attend upon this happy union  sir william is not calculated for solitude he is now debarred from fieldsports and every kind of exercise and he seeks for amusement from books in vain  that taste which can alone render reading pleasant or useful to us must be acquired in youth the muses like the rest of their sex resent neglect and may be wooed but not won by those who only seek them as a supplement to more lively pleasures youths the season made for joy and for literature also  colonel walters housekeeper has been to visit benson several times of late and has endeavored with a competent share of art to discover how mrs walter had escaped and where she now is you may suppose that she has not gained the wishedfor intelligence  benson would die sooner than betray me  harriet and i have often wondered that no hint relative to mrs walter has ever escaped the colonel  i am sometimes tempted to think that he believes us ignorant of that affair but when i recollect his blushing in the temple upon some hint of mine relative to it i change my opinion  what a heart must that man have how black and of course how wretched i am inclined to believe that the wicked expiate a great part of their sins in this world by their constant fear of detection  sir arthur and miss ashford are often with us i begin to apprehend that she has a partiality for colonel walter and am distressed how to act on this occasion  should i speak of him as i think she may attribute my sentiments either to private pique or a general love of slander as i am not at liberty to acquaint her with those facts on which my dislike to him are too justly founded  yet will it not be an act of baseness to suffer this charming girl to throw away her affections on such a wretch think for me fanny and direct me how to conduct myself in this critical situation  give a thousand loves and congratulations for me to my brother and his  latest found heavens last best gift wishes for their happiness must be superfluous yet they have mine most truly  accept the same from your ever  affectionate sister louisa barton ps i find i cannot write a short letter to you  when i began this i determined not to exceed a page but like eloise  my heart still dictates and my hand obeys and wherefore should i restrain them or debar myself from the greatest satisfaction i enjoy i am not good catholic enough to have faith in the merits of voluntary penances especially as i feel that i am not without my share of those that are imposed on us  no works of supererogation for me  once more adieu    letter l miss cleveland to lady barton paris still but on the point of quitting it in a few hours  my brother arrived here on sunday night and with him  but no matter  he is not of sufficient consequence to interrupt a narrative in which we are all so much interested  you may be curious though  lord hume then came with sir george from naples he has had a thousand ridiculous adventures in italy  i have not seen him yet and do not know when i shall  my eyes as you apprehended certainly told tales for the moment sir george saw me he said there is a glad expression in my sisters face that would almost tempt me to hope beyond the bounds of reason but alas fanny there is no redemption from the grave  true sir george i answered but perhaps your treasure may not yet be consigned to that strong chest  he caught my hand and pressing it to his heart cried out it is impossible that you should mean to trifle with my anguish yet did she not expire at amiens  she never was at amiens i replied  where where then did her pure spirit take its flight and quit her lovely form  you must be more composed sir george before i can talk further on this subject  why was it started fanny why are my wounds all made to bleed afresh can you delight in cruelty  far from it you know how tenderly i sympathized with your distress when i believed her dead  if there is a cause in nature that can make you doubt it now o speak it quickly and ease my anxious heart  i have strong reasons to believe she lives or i should not thus have alarmed you  my friend mrs walter has seen and conversed with a young lady of the name of delia colville in a convent at saint omers who may be her  he dropped upon his knees  and exclaimed  gracious heaven but realize this blessed vision let me no longer mourn my delias loss and unrepining will i then submit to all that fate or fortune can inflict upon my future days speak speak on my sister and say again that you believe she lives  indeed i do believe so my dear brother  he rose and caught me in his arms while the large drops ran plenteous down his cheeks  tears relieved us both  i then proceeded to acquaint him with those circumstances which i have already informed you of as i thought i might now venture to speak to him with more certainty and that i felt too much pain in keeping him longer doubtful  his transports increased and it is utterly impossible to give any idea of the excess of his joy  it was with difficulty i could prevent his going at midnight to lord h  but though i prevailed on him to defer his visit till morning i could not persuade him to go to bed or attempt to take any rest or food except a little wine and water and the whole night was spent in repeating what i had told him before and rereading mrs walters letter  selfish mortal as he is he barely mentioned his having extricated lord hume out of some doleful disasters that befell him at naples in which an operasinger was the principal performer  but what consequence could he suppose the story to be of to me  though i neither am or ever mean to be connected with his lordship i am pleased that my brother saved his life and that by his means he has got quit of an artful woman who might probably have ruined his fortune and i have a kind of satisfied pride also in thinking that he is so much indebted to our family  i am afraid there is something mean in the above reflection  but i am not now at leisure enough to trace it back to its source  at some other time i will fairly and philosophically investigate its nature and receive or reject it according as i find it derived from a good or bad origin  long before the ambassadors servants were stirring my brother attempted his door and i think he returned three times before his excellency was visible as soon as he had acquainted him with his business lord h  very obligingly set out with him for versailles and has promised to get the order for delias enlargement as much expedited as possible  my brother as you may suppose remains in waiting till it is finished and is then to call on me and fly to st omers without staying for the return of the chancellors messenger from toulouse i have sat all day in my traveling dress as i would not delay him for any consideration  i mentioned your joy on the recovery of delia he returns your love an hundredfold and says he will write both to you and sir william as soon as his spirits are a little more composed  i fear to attempt answering my dear louisas letter at present as i expect to be summoned by my brother every instant  his carriage turns into the port cochere this moment adieu  ma tres chere soeur f cleveland  letter li miss cleveland to lady barton st omers though i have been here three days my head is still giddy with the violent motion and emotion i have gone through since i left paris  we set out the moment i had sealed my last letter to you and traveled with as much expedition as french roads horses and postboys would permit sir george was determined to stop at amiens and notwithstanding the certain assurances i had given him that his delia was alive he seemed to be strongly agitated when we drove into the town  he inquired from our landlord whether he recollected a young english ladys dying there at such a time and being answered in the affirmative the color forsook his cheek he fell almost lifeless on a settee that was near him and sighed out ah fanny why have you deceived me  i could not help being provoked at his weakness and told him i did not know that he was to be a mourner for all the young english women that should die in france that i was perfectly convinced miss colville was alive and well or i should not have set out on our present expedition but if he was inclined to think otherways he had better not pursue the journey any farther  he replied with his usual mildness   who loves must fear  and sure who loves like me must greatly fear but my reliance on you has banished my apprehensions and i now only desire to inquire into this affair to know by what means mrs colville could avail herself of a strangers death to carry on the vile deceit she has practiced  our host like most others was very well inclined to be communicative and informed us of the following particulars that on such a day the diligence that goes to paris stopped at his house and set down a very pretty young woman who was so extremely ill that she was not able to travel farther and that notwithstanding all possible care was taken of her she expired on the fourth day after her coming there  they had discovered before she died that she was an english heretic as she absolutely refused to let any of their clergy attend her during her illness but they knew not even her name nor whom she belonged to and though her clothes and effects were sufficient to defray the expenses of her funeral yet as she was not a catholic she could not be interred in consecrated ground and mine host to use his own phrase said he was in a perfect quondary to know how he should dispose of the body  but as good luck would have it a lady and her maid arrived at his house the next day in a postchaise  as they were english he acquainted them with his distress and the maid was sent to look at the dead person in order to know if she could give any account of her  she returned to her mistress and they were for some time shut up together  at last the lady herself went to look at this lifeless beauty and the moment she saw her she gave a loud scream and ran back into her apartment  some time after the maid called for him and told him that it was her ladys daughter who had died there and gave some hints of her having eloped from her friends  she desired that every thing might be prepared in the best manner for sending the body to england and strictly charged him not to let any person go into the chamber where she lay but those who were immediately concerned about the body  she added that he might dispose of the young ladys effects as he thought proper except a small trunk which contained only a miniature picture a pocket book and some letters and the lady would pay all the necessary expenses on this melancholy occasion  every thing was then done as she directed to the mutual satisfaction of mine host and that burier of the living and robber of the dead mrs colville  i have not now leisure to expatiate on this extraordinary coincidence of circumstances yet i must observe that fortune seemed inclined to favor mrs colvilles deceit by the particular situation of the young woman at amiens whose interment had imposed on all delias friends even on her lover and prevented any further inquiry about her  i dare say you are by this time very impatient to get us to our journeys end but dont be in a hurry louisa for our haste in setting out before the next day occasioned a very disagreable delay as it brought us to the gates of st omers an hour after they were shut and obliged us to pass a miserable night in what they call an auberge but in our country i think it might more justly be styled a barn  at last the wishedfor morning came and we pursued our way directly to the convent  it is impossible to give you any idea of my brothers emotion  when we were shown into the parlour i desired to see the superior  i know that i must not stop here to give you a description of her person but indeed she is a fine old lady  as soon as she appeared i delivered the kings mandate to her which she read with great dignity but not without surprise and said if she had been imposed on with regard to the young lady in question she was not to blame and added that she was ready on the instant to obey the kings order by delivering miss colville to my care  sir george in a transport exclaimed let me but see her madam  there i interposed my negative for delias sake as i feared the effects which so unexpected an interview might have upon her spirits  it was therefore at last agreed to that i should go into another parlour see mrs walter and send her to prepare delia for such a joyful event  our amiable friend soon came to me and i have the happiness to tell you that she is most wonderfully recovered but in pity to my brothers impatience i scarce waited to inquire her health before i appointed her the messenger of glad tidings to our dear delia  she returned with her in an instant but when the lovely girl beheld me she could not speak she made an effort to put her hand through the grate and funk down on a chair that stood near her  tears came to her relief and she at last articulated o my beloved fanny my more than sister at that word she blushed and hid her face as if to wipe away the tears  i instantly replied you are my dear the sister of my choice and by that tender name and for my brothers sake i beg you to compose yourself  he is now in the house and most ardently longs to see you but must not be indulged at the expense of injuring your health by an increase of agitation  if you were calm he should appear this moment  i am quite calm she said and fainted away  i do not think i was ever so terrified in my life  by the assistance of the nuns she was brought to herself in about ten minutes and by the superiors permission sir george was admitted into the parlour with me  i thought their meeting would have killed us all  even an old nun wept while she administered drops and water to the whole company  i feel myself too much affected even at this instant to be able to repeat the noconversation that passed at the time sir george embraced me as if i had been his mistress and delia clung round mrs walters neck calling her deliverer guardian angel etc  when our transports had a little subsided i proposed our adjourning to the inn till we could be accommodated with private lodgings for we had before agreed to wait the return of the chancellors messenger at st omers as it was absolutely necessary that my brother should have a little rest after his fatigue both of mind and body  but he was not fated to taste repose as speedily as i then hoped for  i received miss colville in due form from the hands of the superior by whom many compliments and apologies were made to her late prisoner  delias behavior was charming for instead of reproaches for the severity she had suffered she returned thanks for the great care that had been taken of her and took a most polite and even affectionate leave of the whole community  mrs walter and olivia accompanied us to the inn and we passed the day in mutual congratulations and in moralizing on the providential series of incidents that had procured delias deliverance  but toward evening we all perceived a visible change in her countenance and before midnight there appeared strong symptoms of a fever  my brother was almost distracted my heart bleeds for him  should she again be torn from his fond heart i think it would be impossible that he should survive the second blow  but i will hope the best  he has not gone to bed since we left paris he never stirs from the antechamber of the room where she lies and looks so dreadfully that i am shocked at seeing him  the physicians here say that she is not in danger but they are so miserably ignorant that i cannot rely on their judgment in a case where i am so sincerely interested mrs walter and i sit up by turns and never leave the dear invalid a moment i fear she suffers from her concern for us but she promises and i hope will perform her engagement to be well in a few days  on the very day that we took her out of the convent there came a letter from her mother entreating the superior to send delia to some other nunnery and charging her to deny her ever having been there to any person who should inquire after her  thank god we have counteracted her wicked scheme and i trust he will restore her to our prayers and wishes  again excuse me my louisa for not entering upon the subjects mentioned in your last letter as the present situation of our beloved brother and adopted sister engrosses all my thoughts and i cannot even allow a minutes attention to what appears a very extraordinary circumstance which is lord humes following us from paris and lodging directly opposite to us at st omers he sends five or six times a day to inquire delias health and writes a letter once a day to sir george  i cannot help being pleased with this appearance of attention and goodnature to my brother and at the proper respect he shows in not taking the advantage which he might of obtruding himself into my presence under pretense of visiting his friend  why o why has he foolishly deprived himself and me of what once appeared to have been so great a pleasure to us both but that is past  i do not nor i will not think of him   adieu my dearest sister f cleveland ps you know that sir george mrs walter delia and olivia all love you forgive me then for uniting their affections with mine and presenting them in one bouquet together instead of offering them to your acceptance in detached sprigs  delia has slept all the time i have been writing she wakes this moment she is much refreshed  i fly to tell sir george    letter lii miss cleveland to lady barton st omers our fears have been much increased for delias life since i wrote last but thank heaven they are now happily over her disorder turned out to be the measles the physicians have pronounced her out of danger and all our spirits are attuned to the sweet harmony of love and joy  if i had not been witness of them i should not easily have credited an account of the extravagancies which sir george was guilty of during her illness  i find louisa that when these philosophic gentlemen are thrown the least out of their bias they are not a bit more steady than ourselves and hang up philosophy should be the motto of them all whenever their passions are thoroughly interested  but not to treat my brother too severely his was a very particular case and had his treasure been snatched from his arms almost in the moment he had recovered it the trial would i think have been too severe for human fortitude  the messenger returned from toulouse while delia was in the utmost danger we did not therefore at that time trouble ourselves to inquire what mrs colville had said or done on this extraordinary occasion but we are since informed that she absolutely insists on her daughters being dead and buried and denies her having placed her in the convent  it is shocking to think how very near she was to speaking truth at the very time she uttered this falsehood  she sent off another express to the superior of the ursulines with a letter to tell her that more than her life depended on her steadiness in denying her ever having received delia into the convent and promising to give a thousand guineas to the foundation provided she took care to secret her effectually  the good old lady has put this letter into my brothers possession and he in return has made a present to the sisterhood of five hundred pounds  this paper would be proof sufficient against mrs colville if we had not a still more undoubted evidence in the person of our dear delia  the moment her health is established we shall return to england and notwithstanding my joy at her recovery shall quit st omers with regret as i cannot prevail on my beloved mrs walter to accompany us  she and her sweet little girl are perfectly idolized in the convent and i fear if mrs walters situation would admit of her taking the veil that she would certainly pass the remainder of her days in that quiet asylum  to prevent this i wish long life to the most worthless being upon earth  i should not specify colonel walter here if mrs colville were not alive  i wish they were married together and then i am pretty sure there is not a pair in the drawing room of pandaemonium that would not readily give them due place and precedence  but i will have done with these infernals  and now for your long too long unanswered letter  i hope by this time sir williams recovery has removed the anxiety you must necessarily feel on his illness and released you from a confinement that might possibly injure your health  were it not for these considerations i know of few offices more pleasing than attending a person we love in slight disorders  there is something extremely flattering to a generous mind in the idea of administering relief to anothers pains  to  explain the thought explore the asking eye   what a delightful employment and when crowned with success by the recovery of our patient we are conscious of a certain exultation in the mind which can only arise from the certainty of having done what nature claims and charity enjoins  i have of late experienced great pleasure in the execution of this duty from my attendance on mrs walter and delia and am therefore inclined to elevate the office of nursetending by placing it amongst our rational pleasures and rescuing it from the mean character of one of the mere duties of life  yet i fear i shall make but few converts to my opinion especially amongst the gay world who looking upon it in such a servile light rank it with fasting penitence and prayer and too often postpone them together till they may need them all themselves and then are left in their turn to the care of servants and other mercenaries  mais assez sur ce point  if miss ashford be a woman of sense you run no hazard in trusting her with your opinion of colonel walter though she were ever so much in love  if she be weak she stands more in need of such a friendly warning and if she should break with you in consequence of it i think you may easily console yourself for the loss of such an acquaintance by reflecting that you acted from a spirit of friendship of which she has shown herself unworthy  i perfectly approve of your conduct toward the person himself and am for your sake glad to exculpate lord lucan from the weakness might i not add the dishonor of having made a confidant  what a charming girl is our harriet  i must call her so for indeed i have a very great claim to her affection from having unsolicited bestowed so large a portion of mine on her which i hope when she is lady lucan  dont start louisa  and her heart quite at ease she will generously repay  now pray let me be indulged in talking a little of myself et mon pauvre amant humilie et humiliant  for i believe one and confess the other  my brother has informed me of lord humes misadventures at naples the particulars of which i shall not trouble you with at present as they are nothing different from the too general pranks and hazards of youthful spirits and may serve us better to laugh at on the first teteatete we may ever have the pleasure of enjoying together  i bestow a generous wish that sir georges notion about this matter may prove true that as he has not only seen but felt his folly and extravagance he may be more likely to act prudently for the rest of his life than if he had never erred  this is a maxim universally propagated and may in some instances be true but i can scarce think it a sufficient foundation for a woman of sense to build her happiness on  to a man who has been accustomed to the artful blandishments of an abandoned woman i should much fear that the delicate endearments of a wife would appear as tasteless and insipid as true wit to the epigrammatist or the sweetest viand to the spiced palate  but all this is merely matter of speculation and of no manner of consequence to me for lord hume has never yet attempted to pay me a visit either at paris or here and sir george has not hitherto been in a situation to invite him especially as from a very proper delicacy he has never acquainted him with the circumstances of miss colvilles story and though we set out from paris at the same time he kept different stages from us all the way  the account that my brother has just given me of that particular is this that they had agreed at naples to travel together to england but on their arrival at paris and his hinting to him that i had come to meet him there on account of some singular piece of business or other he had immediately estranged himself from any further connection with him saying after his lively manner that as he looked upon himself to be in the nature of a redeemed knight he thought it his bounden duty to attend his deliverer in the quality of an humble squire till he had escorted him safe into his own country but should wait upon him at such a respectful and unprying distance as might leave the privacy both of his conversation and transactions perfectly free from any manner of restraint  my brother you know was abroad when our affections commenced and grew together while i was under the matronage of my aunt marriot when he returned i had not courage enough to acquaint him with a secret which would better have become lord hume himself to have informed him of as they have ever lived on the most friendly terms together and in the present situation of the affair it would be extremely indiscreet and absurd to breathe the least hints of it now  our childish affections as they must naturally be formed without judgment are generally unfortunate attachments as they sometimes leave such traces on the heart as a long life of maturer reason can scarcely wear away and to you i will not blush to own that were it not for that fatal letter which lord hume wrote to me from naples and which is as indelibly engraved on my heart as the first impression he made there i could again be weak enough were he to solicit it to reassume those rosy fetters which i fancied our juvenile hands had formed sufficiently strong to hold us both for life  but that letter louisa i cannot forget it  i must therefore try to forget the writer of it  i am however vastly pleased with the delicacy of his present behavior  i told you in my last that he lodges opposite to us he is generally planted at his window but whenever i approach mine he bows and retires immediately  he has it seems no kind of business in this place but stays here from the mere possibility of his being in some degree or by some chance or other useful to my brother to whom he thinks himself everlastingly indebted for his kindness to him at naples  gratitude cannot exist in a base mind  how then can gratitude and ingratitude subsist in the same heart  how can the same man run so far in arrear to the account of love and be so ready to overpay the debt of friendship were he a man hackneyed in the ways of the world i should not be so much surprised at this inconsistency of character  men of galantry i have heard consider women as bigoted catholics do heretics and hold no faith with them  and that sweet line which shakespeare has put into the mouth of the innocent juliet is repeated with perhaps an equal degree of contemptible exultation by the abandoned courtier and the apeing cit  at lovers perjuries they say jove laughs but lord hume is young and youth is the spring of virtue at least it is the season when we are most liable to feel  the compunctious visitings of nature in consequence of our trespassing against her laws by injuring the peace or happiness of others  but i am myself trespassing against her first emotion that of selfpreservation by dwelling on a subject which must for ever be productive of pain notwithstanding my repeated efforts to blunt the arrows point  i congratulate you on the near prospect of happiness which opens to your friend miss leister  may it terminate in the possession of all her wishes i hope she is by this time lady creswell and that my sweet little harriet had the pleasure and honor of being her paranymph  i consider this office as a step to advancement and i suppose most young ladies are of my opinion as they are generally very desirous of it  i think i have now though slightly touched upon every article of your last letter and i hope to find a packet from you at my return to doverstreet and that soon very soon after i shall be able to give you an account of the joining of a pair whose hearts are i believe as firmly united as any that ever took hands from the first wedding in eden down to this present day  adieu my dear louisa you are loved and remembered by all here but by none more affectionately than  f cleveland  letter liii lord hume to lord lucan st omers here i am and here like a fool as i am i have been loitering these three weeks without any kind of business or pleasure to pursue or even a creature to converse with except honest old saunders who wonders mightily at my lordship for passing my time so lonesomely as he phrases it  you will perhaps wonder too till i inform you that i have the pleasure of seeing fanny cleveland every day  dont envy me lucan for i am only permitted to gaze at her across the street where we both live at present  i wish i had a little of the fascinating power of the basilisk in my eyes that might make the dear girl throw herself into my arms and may i perish if i would injure her when she was folded there  but how came i here in the midst of my friends alone you will be curious enough to ask to which i can make no other answer than to repeat the hint i gave you from paris with regard to some mystery or other relative to sir georges concerns it cannot be any affair of galantry or a sister would not be his confidante  it cannot be a business of honor or i should probably have been let into the secret  we may fairly conclude then that it must certainly be some second love engagement or other of difficulty which his romantic punctilio may not leave him yet at liberty to divulge  for he appeared to be one of the knights of the sorrowful countenance as well as your lordship when i met him first at naples  however that matter may be i have taken care ever since his reserved communication to me never to distress him by my visits and though we travel the same road together i may be rather said to attend on than accompany him all the way  i remember when my infatuation for margarita was at the height your telling me that i loved fanny cleveland notwithstanding  i was surprised at an assertion then which i now find to be true  but allowing this fact which i suppose she must be certain of as well as you by my hankering after her at this rate and the timid respect i treat her with from my window which is directly opposite to here is   tell me my heart if this be love dont you think she uses me rather too severely but all lovers are unreasonable  and false ones deserve mortification  though perhaps it may be my own fault that i am kept thus aloof for i am such a bashful penitent that i have not courage enough to desire leave to wait on her though surely some favorable interval might be contrived even amidst the occupation of the most secret family intercourse to afford sufficient leisure for the common decencies of friendship or politeness  i would give any consideration that the rst interview was over end as it may but i do noturge it though i am convinced that sir george knows nothing either of the engagements or the breach between his sister and me  i wish i could pluck up heart of grace enough to tell him all about it for as i told you before he is a very sensible man and though he had lately some honorable attachment or other and may perhaps have entered into a new one since  without any manner of imputation  for constancy to the grave is both madness and folly  yet i think it is at least ten to one that he has had some little gayete de coeur in the margarita style himself at some time of his life and therefore would not make such a fuss about a mans having strayed a little out of his road on a common as his prudish sister might do who to be sure like all other dianas steers exactly by rule and compass  i wish you were here this moment to advise me how to conduct myself under my present difficulty for i am in confounded awkward circumstances and though you pretend to be a much modester youth than me i will be hanged were you in my situation if you would not extricate yourself much easier than i can possibly contrive to do  but whither has my former undaunted spirit taken its flight to of late i had once the courage to give a bold affront and yet tremble now at the justice of asking pardon for it  thus conscience conscience lucan makes cowards of us all  if they get over to england before i have obtained leave to wait on miss cleveland it is all over with me for i may visit sir george seven years and never see his sister my last resource must be to get into the same pacquetboat with her and pray most devoutly for a good storm in our passage that we may be cast away and that i may have an opportunity like jaffier   to save her life with half the loss of mine or else that the waves may swallow me and my folly together and so leave no trace behind of your affectionate friend  hume ps you are so confoundedly dry and uncommunicative that i have left off asking you any more questions about your mistress  if she should turn out a diavola like mine  i mean margarita  i am sure you will not be such a simpleton as to tell me and yet it would be but goodnatured of you to let me laugh in turn  write to me however and direct to almacks for i hear we are all to set out for old england next week    letter live lord hume to lord lucan st omers still and my tutelar saint shall omer be as long as i exist  little did i think my dear lucan when i concluded my last letter that i should write to you again from this place where the dull uniformity of my life seemed nothing calculated to afford the least subject matter for another line but chance  how much are we all indebted to chance  has happily furnished me with materials sufficient to write an epic poem if i were but as good a poet homer as who must certainly have taken his name from this place  h non est litera you know  for i insist upon it that the burning of three real good and substantial houses in this town is to the full as interesting a subject to all mortals now living as the famous conflagration of his imaginary troy  i further affirm that helen was but a sunburned dowdy to the lovely fanny cleveland whom i happier far than any hero living or dead have just now rescued from the flames and that the gentle delia colville is much handsomer than madam andromache who i think ranked next to her in beauty that sir george cleveland is as brave as hector and that your friend hume is at least as much in love as monsieur paris i do not mean either the tailor or the saint of that name but the very identical trojan with whom ledas daughter ventured herself on shipboard as my adorable fanny will presently with me  may prosperous gales attend our argos a richer sure than ever sailed from colchis for i do not now stand in need of the machinery of a storm  the glorious element of fire has purged away my foulness and like the asbestos i am rendered pure again my fanny too rises a newborn phoenix from her nest  i am in such spirits lucan that i find it impossible to give you a rational account of this charming adventure  suffice it then to say that i had the happiness  that expression is too faint  anagogy a divine ecstasy or oracular sensation is the word  to save my fannys life may i not add  i dare not pronounce it  she must she will be grateful in her soft looks and downcast eyes i read my pardon signed  the regards of anger are erect and fierce those of disdain oblique and scornful  but fannys eyes they never were so beautiful as now  scarce raise their lovely lids and only sparkle through their sable fringe like stars in a clear sky  i think that is a poetical image beat it lucan and i will allow you to be about half as much in love as i am  i cannot stay to scribble any more to you rejoice with me congratulate me and believe me yours sincerely  hume ps if i ever recover my wits again i will deal out the particulars of my trial ordeal  but believe me i would prefer my present inebriation to all the sober sense that ever was from solomon down to samuel  need i add the surname of johnson here    letter lv lord lucan to lord hume i received both your letters my dear hume by the same packet and as i think it much pleasanter to congratulate than condole i shall only reply to the last of them for if you are as i now begin to think a true lover your present happiness must have banished every trace of your former disquiet  you have indeed my lively friend been mightily indebted to chance and i hope you will pardon me for saying that it has done more in your favor than you had any right to have hoped for  but you careless fellows sometimes profit more by getting into scrapes than we sober ones do by keeping out of them  i think it requires the utmost effort of disinterested friendship not to envy you the happiness of having been serviceable to the woman you love  and such a woman too whose generous nature can be softened into a forgiveness of injuries by the small merit of having done an act that any man in the world though not a lover would have been proud to have performed but who is delia colville pray this is another personage added to your former drama  being her first appearance on the stage  but she must be the new mistress of sir george i suppose whom you hinted at before and so that mystery is unravelled at last  helas que mon sort est plus bizarre  the object of my adoration has been ill dangerously ill for some time and i have not even dared to express my sorrow for her sufferings or relieve my anxiety by incessant and minute inquiries about her health  we are many many miles asunder almost at the opposite extremes of this kingdom and i am debarred even the poor indulgence of lamenting by secret correspondence the pangs i hourly feel from absence  but she is the ruler of my destiny and i will not murmur or repine at whatever she shall ordain  do i not then deserve that chance or fortune should do something in favor of such an humble and patient sufferer as i am  yet what can it do for me circumstanced as my unhappy passion is it must be criminal even to hope that those insuperable bars which now divide us should ever be removed  and yet my weak my guilty heart even at this moment feels a gleam of joy in thinking that there is a chance which soon may set her free  let me not dwell upon the subject or breathe a wish that must render me unworthy of her  i have received an invitation to attend the nuptials of an intimate friend of mine who has been long in love with a very amiable young woman but till now withheld by parents  though utterly unfit for any scene of festivity i cannot refuse this summons as i am truly interested in the happiness both of the bride and bridegroom  i shall therefore set out immediately for dublin the wedding will be celebrated a few miles from it but direct to me there  and if you have yet descended from your hyperbolical heights pray let me have a simple newspaper paragraph about the fire and the facts that attended it your hopeless state has been bettered i find by the same unnatural means that the wretched farmers of this country use with their land when their crops begin to grow thin they burn it but you are a lucky fellow in every thing  even your ill behavior to miss cleveland turns out now to your advantage  a woman affords an irrefragable proof of her love who forgives such an affront for if she does believe me that it is her own passion not your chivalry that has recovered her to you  adieu lucan  letter lvi lady barton to miss cleveland elm grove near dublin thank you my fanny for the pleasure i have received from all your letters but particularly for the last which announces the glad tidings of delias recovery of my brothers approaching happiness and of your return to england  you will see by the date of this that i have made an excursion from southfield since my last  sir william who is now i hope in a fair way of recovery has at last consented to lucys most earnest and repeated request and has kindly permitted me to attend her nuptials  he intends to pass the time of my absence with colonel walter  i am sorry he has chosen him for his companion but what arguments could i oppose to his inclinations  on my arrival in dublin yesterday morning i was met by my beloved lucy and her beloved lover  i never saw delicate happiness so strongly impressed upon elegant features as it appeared in both their countenances yet there was a little mixture of timidity in lucys eyes which abated their vivacity but increased that charming look of sensibility which is the natural result of refined tenderness  the most irresistible of female charms  harriet who came with me is in high spirits she is to have the honor you wished her of being bridemaid on this occasion  young girls are always delighted at the prospect of a wedding and consider that most solemn and hazardous act of our lives merely as a festival  when alas  but this wedding will i hope and believe justify their opinion and make a holiday for both their lives amen isay with all my heart  mrs layton lucy harriet and i came here yesterday in my coach this morning i have been all about the place and never saw a sweeter spot the prospects are delightful there is an ample view of the bay of dublin and of the opposite hills which for many miles are richly cultivated and adorned with numberless gardens and villas  there is nothing in the environs of london half so beautiful as neither the thames or medway can pretend to vie in beauty or in grandeur with the ocean  this lovely seat sir harry creswell has just purchased and settled it as a jointure house on my fair friend leaving his familymansion to descend in the usual course to his heirs male  i am pleased with the propriety and delicacy of this action as i have always thought it extremely cruel that a woman should be obliged to quit her house on the death of her husband and be as it were turned adrift in the world at the time she has lost her chief stay and support in it  sir harry is to dine with us here this day and to go back to dublin which is just six miles off at night tomorrow he returns here again to part from his lucy no more the ceremony is then to be performed in a neat private chapel within the demesne  miss creswell a sister of sir harrys is to be the other bridemaid and his bridemen whoever they are to be will i suppose attend him hither  i hear a carriage driving furiously and am not yet dressed  it must be sir harry  lovers are impatient  it is he indeed but can i believe my sight lord lucan with him my fate pursues me o fanny i can write no more  adieu l barton  end of the second volume
