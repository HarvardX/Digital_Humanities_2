civil discord and intestine war for york and lancasters disputed claim whose bleeding scars our eyes may yet behold he prays his faithful loving subjects help to further this his just great enterprise  hobbs so the drift and meaning whereby as it were of all your long purgation sir humphrey bows is no more in some respect but that the king wants money and would have some of his commonality   sir h tanner you rightly understand the matter   j aston note this withal where his dread majesty our lawful sovereign and most royal king might have exacted or imposed a tax or borrowed greater sums than
