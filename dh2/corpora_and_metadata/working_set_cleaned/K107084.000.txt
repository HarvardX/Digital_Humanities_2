the advancement and reformation of modern poetry  a critical discourse in two parts  the first showing that the principal reason why the ancients excelled the moderns in the greater poetry was because they mixed religion with poetry  the second proving that by joining poetry with the religion revealed to us in sacred writ the modern poets might come to equal the ancient  ab jove principium musae virg per ambages deorumque ministeria praecipitandus est liber spiritus petron by mr dennis  london printed for rich parker at the unicorn under the piazza of the royal exchange in cornhil m dcci  to the most noble john lord marquess of normanby earl of mulgrave etc and knight of the most noble order of the garter my lord i make no question but that all those gentlemen who shall happen to be offended at the newness and boldness of the positions which are the subject of the following treatise will accuse me of want of judgment not only for advancing em but for daring to bring em under the protection of so discerning a judge as your lordship  but i desire those gentlemen to believe that if i had had a mind that my faults should have lain concealed or would have consulted my own more than the public advantage your lordship is the person to whom of all mankind i would last have chosen to have addressed them that tho you had never writ your admirable essay i should have been convinced by your other poems and particularly by your temple of death a temple that is consecrated at the same time to death and to immortality of your perfect knowledge in criticism because i have experience enough to be satisfied that there never was a great poet in the world who was not an accomplished critic horace who was one of the greatest of the roman poets was in the first rank of judges and virgil has taken care to transmit to posterity one of the exactest pieces of criticism that ever was writ in the world tho indeed it is a criticism by examples only of which bossu vouchsafed to write the rules above sixteen hundred years afterward  thus my lord i am sufficiently acquainted with your character to approach you with awe but at the same time i am convinced that they are mistaken who believe that the most discerning are the most rigid judges i am satisfied that a write has a great deal of reason to be more apprehensive of half critics who are governed by opinion or guided by prejudice or swayed by partial affection and who see faults but in some places and at some particular times for such censors are inexorable to the least of our errors but your lordship whose unclouded understanding sees all our faults wherever they are and who knows how difficult if not impossible it is for us not to err will make large allowances for the imperfections of humane nature or our particular frailties if you discover in us the appearance of any good quality which may bespeak your indulgence imperfect partial prejudiced critics have judgment enough to discover faults but want discernment to find out beauties or if at any time by chance they discover them they are perhaps too interested or too envious or too fearful to own them but as nature that has given you so many extraordinary qualities has conspired with fortune in setting your lordship infinitely above so mean a passion as envy so she has placed you as far above the imperious sway of opinion that madly tyrannizes over the multitude your lordship never approves of our actions because they have met with success but because they deserve to succeed and here i humbly desire of your lordship that in behalf of all the lovers of poetry i may return you thanks for the protection and patronage of a great man deceased it is known to all the observing world that you generously began to espouse him when he was more than half oppressed by a very formidable party in the court of king charles ii a faction that wanted neither power nor authority to crush him who besides that they held the foremost rank in the state had got possession of the minds of the people with whom they had acquired a great reputation for their knowledge and capacity in matters of wit and criticism if that great man had faults your lordship wanted no discernment to find them but you wanted malice partiality prejudice and the rest of those ungenerous obstacles that hindered others from discovering or confessing his beauties your lordship easily found that he had beauties which overweighd all faults and it was that consideration that engaged you to support him against his powerful adversaries they upon an unaccountable  which they had taken to his person  have oppressed his growing merit  consideration of that  cherished his person notwithstanding his pretended frailties and while others to express their malice to the man would have hindered the advancement even of that art which they pretended to esteem so much your lordship on the contrary by a wise a good natured and a noble proceeding cherished the man on purpose to make him instrumental in advancing the art and as it was after you took him into your protection that he writ several of his most valuable pieces it is to your lordship that the world is in some measure indebted for the greater number of his excellencies  and with the same greatness of mind with which to advance a noble art you raised and supported a man oppressed by very powerful adversaries so in order to the same design you pulled down the tyranny of public prejudice and of a triumphant opinion for it is known to all the world that your lordship declared against the obscenity which was shamefully crept into our english poetry at a time when not only that way of writing but the verses which you particularly hinted at were in the very height of their reputation but the success was answerable to the nobleness of your lordships attempt those verses have gradually declined ever since in their reputation and nothing of that nature will now be suffered by any but the rabble so that your lordship has done a very signal kindness not only to a noble art but to virtue itself and have highly obliged all virtuous men as well as lovers of poetry  my lord i have mentioned this the more willingly because it fairly gives me an opportunity of confirming by your lordships authority the assertion which is the foundation of the following treatise which is that religion gives a very great advantage for the exciting of passion in poetry your lordship has informed us that obscenity and poetry are things that are inconsistent the assertion must be granted by all to be unquestionably true for nothing can be possibly consistent with an art which runs counter to the very end and design of that art now the end of poetry is to instruct and reform and obscenity in writing corrupts the manners but this on the other side is not to be doubted that verses may be produced from the ancient poets which are at once obscene and poetical tho at the same time it must be confessed that they would have been more fine if they had been more chaste but if any one demands why ribaldry should be  in the ancient poetry when it is so plainly insufferable in the modern to him i answer that it can be nothing but the religion of the ancients which makes the difference for theirs was very consistent with obscenity whereas ours entirely abhors it a way of writing that was authorized by their religion could never be said to be utterly inconsistent with instruction besides passion is the principal thing in poetry and tho obscenity has something too gross and fulsom in it to consist with the delicacy of a tender passion yet by mingling with their obscene verses their cupid their venus and the rest of their amorous divinities they had the advantage of that other sort of passion which we call enthusiasm whereas the divinity of our religion being utterly abhorrent of any thing which is impure such ribaldry inserted in our poetry can never possibly either instruct or move  the consideration of what your lordship has done to advance poetry has obliged me to lay the following treatise at your feet a present i confess that is altogether unworthy of you but it is by much the most valuable that either i have or ever have had to make and your lordship has accepted it with the same goodness that the persian king did the apple he saw that it was all that his subject could do to testify his acknowledgment and for that very reason it was more agreeable to him than the vain pompous presents of those who believed they could add to his treasure i believed that the very design to improve an art which your lordship has actually so much advanced would prevail upon your goodness to excuse a great many faults which you may find in the following treatise  but upon mentioning the design of the ensuing discourse i find my self sufficiently perplexed there are several things of the last importance that ought to be preliminary to the discourse itself and i find that i have strong temptations upon me of following mr drydens example and of saying to your lordship what is usually directed to the reader in general but then i consider that i have neither mr drydens great qualities nor like him a reputation long established nor what ought chiefly to be considered the honor of having often approached your lordship to authorize such a liberty but yet on the other side the things that i have to say are of important consequence to the good of the cause which i have undertaken and i find that i should be ting to that noble cause if i should address my self to the reader in general and i should be thought by all discerning persons to proceed as absurdly as would a lawyer who upon a solemn pleading should apply himself to the multitude who have little knowledge of his affair and no authority to determine it instead of speaking to his awful judge who has a perfect knowledge of his cause and a sovereign authority to decide it  the design of all poetical criticism must be if it is just and good to advance so useful and so noble an art as poetry and the design of the following treatise is no less than to set the moderns upon an equal foot with even admired antiquity in order to the doing which i humbly desire leave of your lordship that i may make an enquiry in what the preeminence of the ancient poets consists and why i prefer one of the grecian tragedies as for example the oedipus of sophocles to one of our celebrated english tragedies as for instance the julius caesar of shakespeare upon reflection i find that the reason is because i am more delighted and more instructed by the former and that for this very reason because i am more moved by it for i find by experience that i am no further pleased nor instructed by any tragedy than as it excites passion in me but in order to the discovering why i am more moved by the former than the latter of those tragedies i desire leave to make an enquiry into the principal differences between them and that in all probability will determine the matter i find then my lord that there are two very signal differences between the oedipus and the julius caesar first the oedipus is exactly just and regular and the julius caesar is very extravagant and irregular secondly the oedipus is very religious and the julius caesar is irreligious for with submission to your lordships judgment i conceive that every tragedy ought to be a very solemn lecture inclucating a particular providence and showing it plainly protecting the good and chastizing the bad or at least the violent and that if it is otherwise it is either an empty amusement or a scandalous and pernicious libel upon the government of the world the killing of julius caesar in shakespeare is either a murder or a lawful action if the killing caesar is a lawful action then the killing of brutus and cassius is downright murder and the poet has been guilty of polluting the seen with the blood of the very best and last of the romans but if the killing of caesar is murder and brutus and cassius are very justly punished for it then shakespeare is on the other side answerable for introducing so many noble romans committing in the open face of an audience a very horrible murder and only punishing two of them which proceeding gives an occasion to the people to draw a dangerous inference from it which may be destructive to government and to human society  thus my lord i have a great deal of reason to suspect that the oedipus derives its advantage from its regularity and its religion and the presumption grows still more strong when upon enquiry i find that the forementioned regularity is nothing but the bringing some rules into practice which observation and philosophy have found requisite for the surer exciting of passion for as this i think cannot be contested that of two combatants who have equal strength and equal courage he is most likely to have the better who has the most address so in a contention and prize of poetry between persons who have equal force of mind he will be certain to have the advantage who is the best instructed to use his strength  if any of the enemies to regularity will give themselves the trouble to peruse the oedipus of sophocles with an impartial eye he will easily discern how instrumental the poetical art is in leading him from surprise to surprise from compassion to terror and from terror to compassion again without giving him so much as a time to breathe and he will as easily discover how the religion that is every where intermixed with the play shows all the surprises even when he least expects this as so many immediate successive effects of a particular dreadful providence which make them come like so many thunderclaps from a serene heaven to confound and astonish him  a poet is capacitated by that which is commonly called regularity to excite the ordinary passions more powerfully by the constitution of the fable and the influence which that must necessarily have both upon the words and thoughts and religion besides the influence it will have upon the ordinary passions will be to a poet who has force and skill enough to make his advantage of it a perpetual source of extraordinary passion which is commonly called enthusiasm for the sentiments and the expressions  for what concerns regularity or the exciting of ordinary passion enough has been said already your lordship has particularly made the public a present which is i confess but little in volume but is magnificent in value and ornament it is a present in jewels which casts a further luster than treasures that take up a larger space and is more solid to those who are near it our writers have been sufficiently told that writing regularly is writing morally decently justly naturally reasonably the design my lord of the following treatise is to show of what use religion may be to the advancement of poetry but because all that has been said concerning regularity is so necessary a preparative to this design that it would be wholly useless without it i hope your lordship will not think it to be foreign to my purpose if at a time when the rules are neglected by some and slighted by others i bestow a little time in proving the necessity of observing those without the strict observance of which the following treatise will be an empty amusement and we must absolutely despair of making any advancement in poetry  the necessity of observing rules to the attaining a perfection in poetry is so very apparent that he who will give himself the trouble of reflecting cannot easily doubt of it rules are necessary even in all the inferior arts as in painting and music if any one should pretend to draw a picture without having ever been taught or without knowing or practicing any thing of perspective or proportion but should pretend to succeed alone by the natural force of his fancy that man would certainly be esteemed a very impudent and impertinent person  your lordship knows that it is the very same thing in music that it is in painting if any one should pretend to compose in parts without understanding the grounds that person would infallibly render himself very contemptible now if they please by rules in a less noble art can they reasonably expect to please without them in one that is more noble if they please not by rules in poetry how must they please by chance for this is certain that they must do it by one or the other for there is no third way  there is nothing in nature that is great and beautiful without rule and order and the more rule and order and harmony we find in the objects that strike our senses the more worthy and noble we esteem them i humbly conceive that it is the same in art and particularly in poetry which ought to be an exact imitation of nature now nature taken in a stricter sense is nothing but that rule and order and harmony which we find in the visible creation the universe owes its admirable beauty to the proportion situation and dependence of its parts and the little world which we call man owes not only its health and ease and pleasure nay the continuance of its very being to the regularity of mechanical motion but even the strength too of its boasted reason and the piercing force of those aspiring thoughts which are able to pass the bounds that circumscribe the universe as nature is order and rule and harmony in the visible world so reason is the very same throughout the invisible creation for reason is order and the result of order and nothing that is irregular as far as it is irregular ever was or ever can be either natural or reasonable whatever god created he designed it regular and as the rest of the creatures cannot swerve in the least from the eternal laws preordaind for them without becoming fearful or odious to us so man whose mind is a law to itself can never in the least transgress that law without lessning his reason and debasing his nature in fine whatever is irregular either in the visible or invisible world is to the person who thinks right except in some very extraordinary cases either hateful or contemptible   both nature and reason which but a two in a larger acceptance is nature owe their greatness their beauty their majesty to th eirperpetualorder for order at first made the face ofthings so beautiful and the cessation of that order would once more bring in chaos so poetry which is an imitation of nature must do the same thing i can neither have greatness or real beauty if it swerves from the laws which reason severely prescribes it and the more irregular any poetical composition is the nearer it comes to extravagance and confusion and to nonsense which is nothing  but as in some of the numberless parts which constitute this beauteous all there are some appearing irregularities which parts notwithstanding contribute with the rest to complete the harmony of universal nature and as there are some seeming irregularities even in the wonderful dispensations of the supreme and sovereign reason as the oppression of the good and flourishing of the bad which yet at the bottom are rightly adjusted and wisely compensated and are purposely appointed by divine foreknowledge for the carrying on the profound designs of providence so if we may compare great things with small in the creation of the accomplished poem some things may at first sight be seemingly against reason which yet at the bottom are perfectly regular because they are indispensably necessary to the admirable conduct of a great and a just design  no man knows better than your lordship that the renowned masters among the ancients homer and virgil etc had too much capacity and too much discernment not to see the necessity of knowing and practicing the rules which reason and philosophy have prescibd to poets they wrote not with a little narrow design to please a tumultuous transitory assembly or a handful of men who were called their countrymen they wrote to their fellow citizens of the universe to all countries and to all ages and they were perfectly convinced that tho caprice and extravagance may please the multitude who are always fluctuating and always uncertain yet that nothing but what is great in reason and nature could be able to delight and instruct mankind they were clearly convinced that nothing could transmit their immortal works to posterity but something like that harmonious order which maintains the universe that it was partly to that they were to owe that wondrous merit which could be able to render their fame eternal to extend and perpetuate the very languages in which they writ and to illustrate the glory of their countries by their own  your lordship knows that it was toward the beginning of the last century that the french a subtle and discerning nation began to be sensible of this and upon it several of their extraordinary men both poets and philosophers began to cultivate criticism upon which there followed two very remarkable things for first the cultivating of the poetical art advanced their geniuss to such a height as was unknown to france before and secondly the appearing of those great geniuss was very instrumental in spreading their language through all the christian world and in raising the esteem of their nation to that degree that it naturally prepared the way for their intrigues of state and facilitated the execution of their vast designs  my lord these alterations happened in france while the french reformed the structure of their poems by the noble models of ancient architects and your lordship knows very well that the very contrary fell out among us while notwithstanding your generous attempt to reform us we resolved with an injudicious obstinacy to adhere to our gothic and barbarous manner for in the first place our stage has degenerated not only from the taste of nature but from the greatness it had in the time of shakespeare in whose coriolanus and cassius we see something of the invincible spirit of the romans but in most of our heroes which have lately appeared on the stage love has been still the predominant passion whether they have been grecian or roman heroes which is false in morality and of scandalous instruction and as false and absurd in physics for ambition makes a man a tyrant to himself as well as it does to others and where it once prevails enslaves the reason and subdues all other passions and it was for this very cause if your lordship will allow me to make this digression that in the two tragedies that i writ my self i made love a subordinate passion and subjected it in the one to glory and in the other to friendship that so i might make them fit to entertain the wisest of our sex and the best and most virtuous of the other and it is impossible to tell you with what extreme satisfaction i heard that the last of them was not displeasing to you  but secondly at the same time that the french has been growing almost an universal language the english has been so far from diffusing itself in so vast a manner that i know by experience that a man may travel over most of these western parts of europe without meeting with three foreigners who have any tolerable knowledge of it and yet the english is more strong more full more sounding more significant and more harmonious than the french i know very well that a great many will be unwilling to allow the last but i appeal to your lordship if this is not a convincing proof of it that we have blank verse which is not inharmonious and the french pretend to no poetical numbers without the assistance of rhyme  but it may perhaps be alleged that the reason why the french has got the advantage of our language is partly from their situation on the continent partly from the intrigues and affairs which they have with their neighbors and partly because their language has more affinity with one of the learned languages but to this i answer that the germans are as advantageously seated as the french for diffusing their language and the spanish tongue is rather nearer related to the latin than is the french and all the world knows that toward the beginning of the last century the house of austria was full as busy with their neighbors as the house of bourbon is now and yet then neither the german nor the spanish tongue made any considerable progress i will not deny but that the situation and affairs of the french may have been of advantage to them in the diffusing their language but it is certainly the learning of any nation that is most instrumental in it i make no doubt but that in learning which is useful and necessary and barely solid without ornament we far surpass the french our practical physicians have more reputation than theirs even in france itself and our practical divines have acquired more fame throughout the northern countries of europe than either the natives of those places or any of the modern french divines whether they are reformed or papistical and this last is therefore the more considerable because they writ in our mother tongue whereas the physicians have employed a learned language but i am very much inclined to believe that it is the polite learning of any nation that contributes most to the extending its language and poetry is the branch of polite learning which is the most efficacious in it in order to the proving this i desire your lordships leave to examine who they are who are most instrumental in making a language pass the bounds which confine the original speakers of it and they seem to me to be the gentlemen of neighboring nations who have time and opportunity to visit foreign countries and are capacitated by their fortunes and their educations to cultivate languages which they were not born to speak for besides that these are the persons who are the most capacitated to learn them they have by the variety and multiplicity of their conversation most opportunities to spread them now the motives that for the most part incite gentlemen to study are two pleasure and vanity but pleasure and vanity will find their account abundantly more in polite learning than in literature which is barely solid for polite learning is more easy and has more of imagination in it and instructs them much better how to varnish their defects and render them agreeable to one another it is chiefly then the polite learning of any nation that engages the gentlemen of foreign countries to apply themselves to study the language of that nation but even of polite learning poetry appears to be the most agreeable and most attractive branch because it is the most moving and we find by experience that in the learning of those languages which have been most generally known poetry has made a very considerable figure gentlemen then in all likelihood will apply themselves most eagerly to the study of that language whose poetry is very agreeable to them but that poetry must be most agreeable to the generality of gentlemen which is most moving and most instructive for tho gentlemen study to please themselves yet if they are men of sense they will not be for empty pleasure but will endeavor to be instructed and delighted together besides when gentlemen begin to study the poetry of any language the first thing they understand is the reasonable part of it for the fineness of the imaginative part which depends in great measure upon force of words and upon the beauty of expression must lie concealed from them in a good degree till they are perfect in the language thus the poetry of that language which is most reasonable and most instructive must in all likelihood have most attraction for the gentlemen of neighboring nations and we have shown above that that is the most reasonable and most instructive poetry which is the most regular  my lord upon this foot it is easy to determine whether our poetry or the french has most attractions for the rest of europe this is plain that moliere corneille and racine and boileau are known in a manner to all the christian world whereas spencer and milton ben johnson and shakespeare are strangers as it were to all the world excepting the subjects of great britain i believe that our language by reason of the dependence that it has upon the saxon is not very difficult to be learnt by the people of the northern countries and in short many of their clergy have learnt enough of it to make their advantage of our ecclesiastical writings but both they and their gentlemen are almost wholly strangers to our poetry whereas the french poets are extremely well known to the but here some angry people will immediately ask if i affirm that our own is inferior to the french poetry to satisfy both them and the truth i am obliged to declare at the same time submitting this matter to be decided by your lordship in the last appeal that i believe we have naturally more force and more elevation than the french that several things in shakespeare are superior to any which the french theater has produced and that in some little poems which either required no symetry or were writ by those who very well knew how to practice it we are absolutely superior to them that at last i am not so much delivering my own thoughts as the opinions of others that the very design i have even in affirming what i do is to do what lies in my little capacity to put our writers in a way to make our neighbors and with them all europe sensible of the advantage which we have by nature that even our natural force must receive accession from art and augment in proportion as the french has done that both our force and our spirit will in all likelihood be augmented by skill as address in the use of our weapons very often adds both to our force and courage that a poem with a fable is like a human body and that the weakness of any one part influences and disables in some degree those which in themselves are strong that if we are not shocked at our own irregularity it is because it has the advantage of long habitude for we have been used to it from our infancy but that to our neighbors who have constantly been used to art and conduct it must seem as awkward and as disagreeable as our gothic cathedrals would to those italians who have always frequented st peters and that what i barely call irregular here would be termed by them indecent immoral unjust unreasonable unnatural in fine i appeal to your lordship whether the french dramatick writers are not believed superior to the english by all the rest of europe th at the same time i am convinced that our writers having naturally more elevation and our language more harmony than theirs and both our writers and language more force we want only art to make ourselves as superior to them in poetry as we formerly were in empire  and here my lord i fancy that i  the enemies to regularity in a little confusion they are too well satisfied of you lordships ability and impartiality to decline your jurisdiction and they cann but remember to their sorrow that you have formerly given the cause against them  upon supposition then that for the futu they will instruct themselves in the poetic art i must leave it to your lordship  determine whether the following treat may be of any service to them and gi them still another advantage over  french by directing them to choose  to manage their subjects in such a manne as may make them most susceptible of potry and that is to find or make the religious a piece of criticism which  i knew not how escaped all the french critics  your lordship knows very well that so of them as for instance boileau dicerning the actual preeminence of the ancients have fondly believed that they were superior to us by nature and that others as perrault very justly disdaining to own such a natural superiority have very unjustly denied their actual preeminence the first part of the following treatise was intended to show that the ancient poets had at actual preeminence but that they derived it from joining their religion with their poetry upon which i believe they were thrown at first by chance the design of the second part is to show that the moderns by incorporating poetry with the religion revealed to us in sacred writ may come to equal the ancients but two things must be always supposed the one that the poets have force and skill equal to the subjects they treat of and a sacred subject requires ten times more of both than a profane one the other is that this is not to be extended to those sorts of poetry in which the moderns cannot possibly make use of their religion with the same advantage that the grecians and romans employed theirs as epic pastoral and amorous poetry  my lord the ultimate end of the ensuing discourse is to show that the intention of poetry and the christian religion being ike to move the affections they may very well be made instrumental to the advancing each other i have reason to believe th this design will not be unacceptable to you lordship not only upon the account of religion it self but as you are an encourage of arts and a great statesman who know that the bare endeavor to advance an a among us is an effort to augment the learning and consequently the reputation and consequently the power of a gre people that the flourishing of the established religion must have a necessary influenc upon the public prosperity that he wh does any thing to recommend christianity to the minds of others endeavors to promote the common good as on the other side he who breaks in upon the revelation makes a dangerous attempt not only upon the constitution but upon government in general that there never was nor ever can be any flourishing government without a revealed religion that several englishmen have lost together with the religion of their ancestors their honor their integrity and their public spirit and that open and avowed deism has grown up among us together with abominable corruptions not only in the manners of private men but in the the administration of public affairs  but now my lord i have been so intent upon my cause that it has almost made me forget that for my having detained you so long i ought to beg pardon not only of your lordship but of your friends and the public that by writing this i am guilty of diverting you from writing or speaking your self something which is much more important either at home or in that illustrious assembly of which you are so solid and shining an ornament i humbly desire of your lordship to excuse the liberty i have taken and to believe that i am with the profoundest respect  my lord your lordships most obliged most humble and most obedient servant john dennis  the advancement and reformation of modern poetry part i chap i the design of the work nothing can show the excellence of poetry more than that it has always been esteemed by the best of men and that there has been no extraordinary man in the world since it came to any perfection but who has commended it or encouraged it  and yet to the confusion of most who have given themselves time to think of it poetry that has been encouraged by so many great princes is believed by several to have degenerated rather than to have improved by time while physics metaphysics and some other arts that have been very little or not at all encouraged have advanced considerably  and what will appear to be yet more strange the very efforts that the moderns have made to advance poetry have done it hurt because they have proceeded upon such erroneous principles as have not only made their attempts successless but have caused them to mistake their errors for their impotence  for some of the moderns who have been great admirers of their contemporaries which is a modest expression for themselves will by no means allow that the ancients have excelled us from which opinion presumption has followed and from presumption security and from security idleness  but despair on the other side has done a great deal more harm than presumption has done on that for some who have been of opinion that the ancients have surpassed us have believed that they have done so because they were in themselves superior to us from which it has happened that they have been servilely contented with following their old masters and most of the best of the modern poetry has been but a copy of the ancient  these different opinions have occasioned disputes and these disputes have produced quarrels which have been maintained with a great deal of heat on both sides the favorers of the moderns have treated their adversaries as dejected littlesould persons who have a base opinion of themselves and of human nature which last they have much ado to forgive them because they are included in the censure  for how can it be say they but a scandalous despondence that obliges us to prefer other men to our selves when reason gives us the preference for this they say is past all dispute that they who excel others in the same kinds of writing must have some advantage over them and that advantage must be either from without or from within or from the subjects they treat of now we can make it appear say the favorers of the moderns that the ancient poets had no external or internal advantage over us and that the advantage of the subject is rather on our side and this is what the favorers of the moderns allege for themselves the partisans of the ancients have on the other side treated the favorers of the moderns as persons that are absolutely ignorant and without taste  that the ancients have excelled us in the greatness of poetry they pretend to prove from the authority of all who have universally been acknowledged to to be the best judges for say they the consent of these where the question is concerning a thing that is rather to be felt than to be demonstrated is of the last importance we defy say they any of the favorers of the moderns to name so much as one modern critic who has any reputation in the world who does not acknowledge that the ancients surpass us in the greatness of poetry for the few say they who have asserted the preeminence of the moderns have immediately rendered themselves ridiculous to all men who have any understanding in these affairs and at length to all the rest excepting a little handful of men whose arrogance and obstinacy and extravagant vanity has been a comedy to the rest  so that the consent of the best critics continue they implies the consent of all and the consent of mankind for so many several ages concerning a thing that is rather to be felt than to be demonstrated is if not a convincing proof at least a very strong presumption but what has been the event of this dispute on both sides why the probability of the arguments instead of working conviction has only exasperated the spirits of the parties and the favorers of the moderns have treated the lovers of the ancients as so many slavish pedants and these on the other side the favorers of the moderns as so many ignorant fools  amidst this diversity of opinions and these contentious ferments i thought i should do an important service to a most noble art if i could contribute any thing to the reconciling the common friends to poetry that they might endeavor the advancement of the common cause with greater force united  in order then to the calming the fury of the contending parties i shall endeavor to extort important concessions from both and oblige on the one side the favorers of the moderns to acknowledge that the ancients are not so weak as to make the moderns presume and engage at the same time the partisans of the ancients to own that the ancients are not in themselves so strong as to make the moderns despair  and in order to the gaining this point with the greater ease and the making my self an agreeable mediator of peace i shall endeavor to make an impartial enquiry into the merits of the cause and try to engage both parties by turns by supporting their just pretensions and whereas the favorers of the moderns have justly alleged that all writers who surpass others in the same kinds of writings must do it from some nternal or external advantage or from the subject it self i shall endeavor to show in the two following chapters that the ancients could not derive their preeminence from any external or internal advantage and afterward we shall proceed to examine whether they derived it from the subjects they treated of  chap ii that the ancients did not excel the moderns by any external advantage the external advantages which one writer has over another are chiefly two the assistance which he receives from the age in which he writes and the encouragement he meets with now we shall show that the ancients did not surpass the moderns on the account of either of these  first they had no advantage in the assistance which they received from the age in which they writ on the contrary the advantage here is clearly on the side of the moderns for good thinking is the foundation of good writing both in eloquence and in poetry now thoughts are but the images of things and our knowledge of things is greater than that of the ancients for several which they knew are better known to us and we know several which they never knew at all how many arts have the moderns improved how many wonderful inventions are owing to them and how many amazing discoveries from which we have a supply of thoughts and images that is never to be exhausted so that in the assistance which we receive from the age in which we live we have the advantage of the ancients  nor secondly is it from the encouragement which they received that the ancient poets excelled the moderns tho at the same time i really believe that encouragement was one of the causes of the ancient excellence of the orators for tho good thinking is the foundation of good writing both in eloquence and in poetry and the moderns are qualified to think as reasonably and as subtly as the ancients thought yet it is in these arts as it is in architecture there can be no beauty nor greatness without foundation but it is not the foundation that makes the greatness or beauty the chief design of eloquence is to persuade and he persuading the most effectually who moves his hearers the most that which makes the greatness and beauty of eloquence is not so much the thinking rightly tho without that there can be no excellence as those violent passions that reign and tyrannize over our souls in the speeches of the ancient orators which they chiefly derived from ambition for the moving their popular assemblies among the ancient grecians and romans being almost the only way among them to arrive at the chief honors of the state it can be no wonder to those who reflect upon the force of ambition and the stings it infixes into the minds of men that the ancient grecians and romans should be so great masters of eloquence for being instigated and stung by ambition they not only were supported in the taking such pains as the moderns are utterly incapable of taking because they have not the same incentive to sustain them but being moved and fired by ambition themselves they the more easily rowzd and inflamed others for if any one happens to urge that the love of glory being alike inseparable from moderns and ancients they have equal incentives to eloquence i desire him to take notice that there is a very considerable difference between the love of glory barely considered and that which is joined to ambition which is the desire of power and place for i desire him to consider what nourishment and force the love of glory that was in the minds of the ancient orators must necessarily have received from the tumultuous applauses of the popular assemblies and the glorious recompenses that ensued upon them  but now if any one thinks that he has here found out the reason why the ancients surpassed us in the greater poetry because passion making the greatness and beauty of poetry as well as it does of eloquence which it certainly does as shall be clearly shown anon and passion receiving access from encouragement the ancient poets writ with a force superior to that of the moderns only because they were more encouraged if any one i say thinks at this rate he will find himself very much mistaken for tho i am convinced that encouragement does very much yet i am satisfied that the difference is not chiefly owing to that for in the first place tho the encouragement which the ancients gave was more general than that which the moderns have met with yet some of the moderns have been as much encouraged as most of the ancients were and yet fall very much short of them in the greater poetry of which boileau and racine are two illustrious examples in the second place homer the most admirable of all the ancients was not at all encouraged in the third place one of the moderns received no encouragement who has often transcendently soared above both ancients and moderns and that is milton as shall be shown in its proper place and lastly comedy was as much encouraged by the grecians and romans as any other sort of poetry witness what the athenians did for aristophanes and scipio and lelius for terence and yet i am persuaded that the moderns have surpassed the ancients in comedy and shall give my reasons below why i make no scruple of preferring moliere and two or three of our own comic poets to terence and aristophanes so that we must seek for another cause of the excellence of the ancient poets than the encouragement they met with  there are three other things which may be numbered among external advantages and those are the climates in which the ancient poets lived and the languages in which they writ and the liberty which they enjoyed but these are not the chief things from which the ancients derived their preeminence for the greatest of the lyrick poets writ in a country of downright blockheads and one of the greatest of the epick poets in a country that had lost its liberty and besides the grecians enjoyed all the advantages of their climate and their language and their liberty long after the decay of poetry it is true indeed the grecians and romans did derive one real excellence from the beauty of their language and that was the harmony of their versification in which the moderns are not likely to equal them but harmony of versification is not the chief thing in poetry nor does the chief excellence of the ancients consist in such a harmony and thus we have shown that they did not derive their preeminence from any thing that was external let us examine in the next chapter whether the ancients derived their excellence from any internal advantage  chap iii that the ancients did not surpass the moderns from any internal advantage there is nothing more certain than that he who handles any subject excellently must do it by the power of his internal faculties and consequently he who treats any subject admirably has an inward advantage over him who treats it scurvily but either that advantage is naturally derived from the subject or it is not if it is naturally derived from the subject in that case we can never pretend to deny that the ancients had an inward advantage over the moderns all that we shall endeavor to prove is that they had no internal advantage over them abstracted from the nature of the subjects of which they treated  now all the internal advantages which the ancients may be supposed to have had over the moderns may be reduced to four divine inspiration inspiration by demons a natural superiority of the faculties of the soul a greater degree of virtue  the first advantage that the ancient poets may be supposed to have had over the moderns is from divine inspiration now the ancient poets were the heathen theologues and to affirm that the spirit of god should inspire those to teach the adoration of idols and inspire them more than he does the moderns who are of the true religion would be equally absurd and blasphemous  nor secondly can they have any advantage by inspiration of demons for in the first place it is absurd to give a supernatural cause of an effect of which we can give a very natural one but we can give a very natural cause of the excellence of the ancient poets as shall be shown anon in the second place the ancients before socrates owed all their moral philosophy to their poets now tho that philosophy was only dispersed up and down in sentences yet had it a natural tendency to the forming that system which afterward the disciples of socrates framed from the mouth of their master and as that system was the utter overthrow of the heathen revelation as we shall show anon any thing that had a natural tendency to the forming that system could not be the work of demons but thirdly supposing the ancient grecian poets were really inspired by demons it is hard to imagine that they should receive a greater advantage from such an inspiration as that than the moderns who apply themselves to sacred poetry should have from divine assistance  nor thirdly can the ancient poets be supposed to have had a greater share of virtue than the moderns for all the grecian poets who were famous for the greater poetry flourished before there was in that part of the world any system of morality and perhaps most of the roman poetry is only a copy of the grecian now it is hard to imagine that they who had no system of morality and no supernatural support should transcend the moderns in virtue who have a perfect system of morality and divine assistance  nor fourthly and principally had the ancient any natural superiority of faculties over the modern poets for if they surpass the moderns in the greater poetry out of any superiority of faculties which they had naturally as they were the ancients it must be by a superiority of understanding or imagination or both but first it was not from any superiority of understanding because from hence it would follow that the minds of men grow weaker by succession of ages and then the ancients would have surpassed one another as they preceded in time orpheus and musaeus would have excelled homer alcaeus and stetichorus pindar thespis euripides and aeschylus sophocles tyrtaeus virgil and alcmon horace which is all absolutely false but then again if any one urges that if the ancients did not surpass one another according to precedence of time it was because art and experience were required to the perfection of poetry and the younger in time had the advantage of the elder both in art and experience to that i answer that some of the poets who are younger in time have perhaps the advantage of those who are older more by nature than they have by art for the tragic and lyrick poets who preceded sophocles and pindar come more behind them in true genius than they go before them in time but now if the ancients did not surpass one another according to priority of time why should they excel us if it be objected that several very extraordinary men happened to be born at such and such particular times to that i answer that this arrived by providence or by chance if you allege that it fell out by chance to that i reply that all the great poets among the grecians flourished within four hundred years of one another and all the great poets among the romans within two hundred years and then let me ask you whither this looked like chance but if you pretend that these men at these particular times were designed such excellent poets by providence and for that very end were formed with faculties so much superior to those who preceded them and who came after them then let me ask you for what design providence should so manifestly alter the course of nature or why that which fell out by providence then may not by providence arrive again  besides if the ancient poets excelled the moderns by a superiority of understanding it would necessarily follow that they understood their subjects better which is false for the subjects of the epick tragic and lyrick poets are the virtues vices and passions of men which the moderns ought to understand at least as well as the ancients because they have all the knowledge of the ancients and their own improvement besides  thus have i endeavored to show that we have no reason to despair of equalling the ancients because of the transcendency of their understandings and what has been said about their understandings may serve to show that they as little excelled the moderns in their imaginations as they did in the other tho something more may be said for the last for the violence of the passions proceeding from the force of the imagination and the corruption of mankind from the violence of the passions and the corruption of mankind growing greater as the world grows older it follows that the imaginations of men must grow stronger as the world grows older  but lastly how vain it is to urge that the ancients excelled the moderns by a superiority of faculties when it will appear a little lower as clear as the sun that one of the moderns very often excells them both in his thoughts and spirit  thus we have endeavored to show that the ancients did not excel the moderns in the greater poetry from any external advantage that is from the assistance which they had from the ages in which they writ or from the encouragement with which they met we have shown too that they did not surpass them from any internal advantage whether it was from divine inspiration or inspiration by demons or transcendency of virtue or superiority of faculties the advantage then which the ancient poets had over the moderns if they had any advantage must be derived from the subjects of which they treated  chap iv that the ancient poets derived their greatness from the nature of their subjects if the ancient poets excelled the moderns in the greatness of poetry that is in epick poetry in tragedy and in the greater ode they must necessarily derive their preeminence from the subjects of which they treated since it has beeu plainly made to appear that they could notderive it from anyexternal or internal advantage and it follows that the subjects which were handled by the ancients must be different from those which have been treated of by the moderns and if the poems which have been writ by the ancients of the forementioned kinds were very much greater than those which have been produced by the moderns why then it follows that the subjects were very different but here the favorers of the moderns assert that the advantage which is to be drawn from the subject is purely on the side of the moderns for who for example will compare the achievements of achilles and aeneas the event of which was only the reducing two pitiful paltry bourgs with the glorious actions of some of our modern captains but then the partisans of the ancients reply that there is a difference between one subject and another which their adversaries seem not to have thought of for say they humane subjects can never differ so much among themselves as sacred subjects differ from humane for the difference between the two last is as great as that between god and man which we know is infinite now say they sacred subjects are infinitely more susceptible of the greatness of poetry than profane ones can be and the subjects of the ancients in the forementioned poems were sacred now that we may engage the lovers of the ancients in their turns by supporting their just pretensions let us endeavor to show in the following chapters that sacred poems must be greater than profane ones can be supposing equality of genius and equal art in the writers and that the poems of the ancients in the forementioned kinds were sacred but in order to the doing that we must declare what poety is and what is its chief excellence  chap v the passion is the chief thing in in poetry and that all passion is either ordinary passion or enthusiasm but before we proceed let us define poetry which is the first time that a definition has been given of that noble art for neither ancient nor modern critics have defined poetry in general  poetry then is an imitation of nature by a pathetick and numerous speech let us explain it  as poetry is an art it must be an imitation of nature that the instrument with which it makes its imitation is speech need not be disputed that that speech must be musical no one can doubt for numbers distinguish the parts of poetic diction from the periods of prose now numbers are nothing but articulate sounds and their pauses measured by their proper proportions of time and the periods of prosaick diction are articulate sounds and their pauses unmeasured by such proportions that the speech by which poetry makes its imitation must be pathetick is evident for passion is still more necessary to it than harmony for harmony only distinguishes its instrument from that of prose but passion distinguishes its very nature and character for therefore poetry is poetry because it is more passionate and sensual than prose a discourse that is writ in very good numbers if it wants passion can be but measured prose but a discourse that is every where extremely pathetick and consequently every where bold and figurative is certainly poetry without numbers  passion then is the characteristical mark of poetry and consequently must be every where for wherever a discourse is not pathetick there it is prosaick as passion in a poem must be every where so harmony is usually diffused throughout it but passion answers the two ends of poetry better than harmony can do and upon that account is preferable to it for first it pleases more which is evident for passion can please without harmony but harmony tires without passion and in tragedy and in epick poetry a man may instruct without harmony but never without passion for the one instructs by admiration and the other by compassion and terror and as for the greater ode if it wants passion it becomes hateful and intolerable and its sentences grow contemptible  passion is the characteristical mark of poetry and therefore it must be every where for without passion there can be no poetry no more than there can be painting and tho the poet and the painter describe action they must describe it with passion let any one who beholds a piece of painting where the figures are shown in action conclude that if the figures are without passion the painting is contemptible there must be passion every where in poetry and painting and the more passion there is the better the poetry and the painting unless the passion is too much for the subject and the painter and the poet arrive at the height of their art when they describe a great deal of action with a great deal of passion it is plain then from what has been said that passion in poetry must be every where for where there is no passion there can be no poetry but that which we commonly call passion cannot be every where in any poem there must be passion then that must be distinct from ordinary passion and that must be enthusiasm i call that ordinary passion whose cause is clearly comprehended by him who feels it whether it be admiration terror or joy and i call the very same passions enthusiasms when their cause is not clearly comprehended by him who feels them and those enthusiastic passions are sometimes simple and sometimes complicated of all which we shall show examples lower and thus i have shown that the chief thing in poetry is passion but here the reader is desired to observe that by poetry we mean poetry in general and the body of poetry for as for the form or soul of particular poems that is allowed by all to be a fable but passion is the chief thing in the body of poetry as spirit is in the human body for without spirit the body languishes and the soul is impotent now every thing that they call spirit or genius in poetry in short every thing that pleases and consequently moves in the poetic diction is passion whether it be ordinary or enthusiastic  and thus we have shown what the chief excellence in the body of poetry is which we have proved to be passion let us now proceed to the proofs of what we propounded that sacred subjects are more susceptible of passion than profane ones and that the subjects of the ancients were sacred in their greater poetry i mean either sacred in their own natures or by their manner of handling them  chap vi that passion is more to be derived from a sacred subject than from a profane one we have proved that passion is the chief thing in poetry and that spirit or genius and in short every thing that moves is passion now if the chief thing in poetry be passion why then the chief thing in great poetry must be great passion we have shown too that passion in poetry is of two sorts ordinary passion or enthusiasm let us now proceed to convince the reader that a sacred poem is more susceptible of passion than a profane one can be which to effect let us show two things that a sacred subject is as susceptible of ordinary passions as a profane one can be and more susceptible of the enthusiastic  the first is evident from experience for the poetry among the ancients which shall be hereafter proved to be sacred had in it greater ordinary passions than their human poetry either had or could possibly have  it is now our business to show that religious subjects are capable of supplying us with more frequent and stronger enthusiasms than the profane and in order to the clearing this let us enquire what poetical enthusiasm is poetical enthusiasm is a passion guided by judgment whose cause is not comprehended by us that it is a passion is plain because it moves that the cause is not comprehended is selfevident that it ought to guided by judgment is indubitable for otherwise it would be madness and not poetical passion but now let us enquire what the cause of poetical enthusiasm is that has been hitherto not comprehended by us that enthusiasm moves is plain to sense why then it moved the writer but if it moved the writer it moved him while he was thinking now what can move a man while he is thinking but the thoughts that are in his mind in short enthusiasm as well as ordinary passions must proceed from the thoughts as the passions of all reasonable creatures must certainly do but the reason why we know not the causes of enthusiastic as well as of ordinary passions is because we are not so used to them and because they proceed from thoughts that latently and unobserved by us carry passion along with them here it would be no hard matter to prove that most of our thoughts are naturally attended with some sort and some degree of passion and it is the expression of this passion which gives us so much pleasure both in conversation and in human authors for i appeal to any man who is not altogether a philosopher whether he is not most pleased with conversation and books that are spirited now how can this spirit please him but because it moves him or what can move him but passion we never speak for so much as a minute together withont different inflexions of voice now any one will find upon reflection that these variations and those inflexions mark our different passions but all this passes unregarded by us by reason of long use and the incredible celerity of our thoughts whose motion is so swift that it is even to our selves imperceptible unless we come to reflect and every one will not be at the trouble of that now these passions when they grow strong i call enthusiastic motions and the stronger they are the greater the enthusiasm must be if any one asks what sort of passions these are that thus unknown to us flow from these thoughts to him i answer that the same sort of passions flow from the thoughts that would do from the things of which those thoughts are ideas as for example if the thing that we think of is great when then admiration attends the idea of it and if it is very great amazement if the thing is pleasing and delightful why then joy and gayety flow from the idea of it if it is sad melancholy if it is mischievous and powerful then the imagination of it is attended with terror and if it is both great and likely to do hurt and powerful why then the thought of it is at once accompanied with wonder terror and astonishment add to all this that the mind producing these thoughts conceives by reflection a certain pride and joy and admiration as at the conscious view of its own excellence now he who strictly examines the enthusiasm that is to be met with in the greater poetry will find that it is nothing but the forementioned passions either simple or complicated proceeding from the thoughts from which they naturally flow as being the thoughts or images of things that carry those passions along with them as we shall show by examples in the following chapter  but these passions that attend upon our thoughts are seldom so strong as they are in those kind of thoughts which we call images for they being the very lively pictures of the things which they represent set them as it were before our very eyes but images are never so admirably drawn as when they are drawn in motion especially if the motion is violent for the mind can never imagine violent motion without being in a violent agitation it self and the imagination being fired with that agitation sets the very things before our eyes and consequently makes us have the same passions that we should have from the things themselves for the warmer the imagination is the more present the things are to us of which we draw the images and therefore when once the imagination is so inflamed as to get the better of the understanding there is no difference between the images and the things themselves as we see for example in fevers and mad men  thus have we shown that enthusiasm flows from the thoughts and consequently from the subject from which the thoughts proceed for as the spirit in poetry is to be proportioned to the thought for otherwise it does not naturally flow from it and consequently is not guided by judgment so the thought is to be proportioned to the subject now no subject is so capable of supplying us with thoughts that necessarily produce these great and strong enthusiasms as a religious subject for all which is great in religion is most exalted and amazing all that is joyful is transporting all that is sad is dismal and all that is terrible is astonishing  chap vii the causes of poetical enthusiasm shown by examples the enthusiasm that is found in poetry is nothing but the forementioned passions admiration joy terror astonishment flowing from the thoughts which naturally produce them for admiration together with that pride which exalts the soul at the conceiving a great hint gives elevation joy if it is great gives transport and astonishment gives vehemence but now let us show by examples how this was done and let us begin with that admirable ode of horace which is the third of the third book  justum and tenacem propositi virum non civium ardor prava jubentium non vultus instantis tyranni mente quatit solida neque auster dux inquieti turbidus adriae nec fulmin antis magna jovis manus se fractus illabatur orbis impavidum ferient ruinae that is  the man the brave man who is resolved upon a right and a firm principle is sure never to have his solid virtue shaken neither by the rage of the giddy multitude nor by the frowns of an insulting tyrant nor by the fury of the roaring south that turbulent ruler of the tempestuous adria no nor by the red right hand of thundering jove nay should the worlds disjointed frame come rushing down with a dismal sound upon him its ruins might crush but they could never shake him now it is plain that in the original there is a great deal of enthusiasm but let us observe a little what this enthusiasm is upon observation we shall find then that in the forementioned verses there is elevation severity and vehemence and consequently there is something admirable in them and terrible and astonishing now why should we feel these passions in reading these thoughts unless the passions naturally attend them when they are expressed as they should be but admiration as we have said above must come from something that is great and terror from something that is powerful and likely to hurt and astonishment from something that is very terrible and very likely to hurt that is from things that are so or from their ideas the reader upon examining the forementioned verses will find that the thoughts in them all are great and terrible and some of them are astonishing  but here i desire the reader to observe three things first the admirable gradation of thought here how the poet rises from something that is terrible to something that is more terrible till he comes at last to something astonishing and amazing how from the rage of the mad multitude he proceeds to the frowns of a tyrant that stands threatening by how he rises from thence to a storm at sea and from thence to the wrath of jove expressed in the dreadful thunder and from thence to the final dismal dissolution of all things the next thing that i desire him to observe is how the spirit of the poet rises with his thoughts which is a sure sign that the one is nothing but the passions that attend on the other and the third thing that the reader is to remark is that the poet could not carry his enthusiasm higher after the second thought without having recourse to religion for he who knows any thing of the pagan system knows that the three last thoughts are taken from their religion  let us now set before the reader an image that only by its greatness will move him and exalt him the passage is in the first book of miltons paradise lost where he thus describes lucifer  he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a towr his form had yet not lost all her original brightness nor appeared less than archangel ruined and the excess of glory obscured as when the sun new risn looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind a cloud in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shone above them all the archangel but his face deep scars of thunder had entrenched i desire the reader would give himself the trouble of comparing these ten lines with the ten that preceded them and then to tell me why the spirit should be so much greater in these than it is in the others unless it proceeded from the greatness of the ideas or how the greatness of the ideas could cause it but by infusing into the poet admiration and a noble pride which expressed make the spirit which is stately and majestic till the last and then it grows vehement because the idea which causes it is not only great but very terrible for all the afflicting passions that are violent are expressed with vehemence the reader cannot but observe of himself that the greatest of these noble ideas is taken from religion  but his face deep scars of thunder had entrenched now let us consider two very masterly images out of the second book of virgil the first is the hewing down of a tree which appeared so admirable to julius scaliger that he affirmed that jupiter could never have mended it and the second gave occasion for that incomparable statue of laocoon which i saw at rome in the gardens of beluidere and which is so astonishing that it does not appear to be the work of art but the miserable creature himself like niobe benumbed and petrified with grief and horror  the first besides its greatness carries terror along with it virgil compares the destruction of troy which had been ten years besieged to the fall of a mountain ash at whose root the laboring swains had been a long time hewing with their axes  ac veluti summis antiquam in montibus ornum cum ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant eruere agricolae certatim illa usque minatur et tremefacta comam concusso vertice nutat volneribus donec paulatim evicta supremum congemuit traxitque jugis avolsa ruinam and as when sturdy swains with frequent strokes hewing with all their stretched out arms let drive at the firm root of some aspiring oak which long the glory of the mountain stood that every moment formidably nods and shakes the lofty glories of its crown till broken by repeated wounds at last down it comes rushing with a fatal groan and tears the earth and rends the solid rock and still is dreadful in its hideous fall now here i desire the reader to consider how the poet raises his spirit as soon as he sets his image in motion and brings in terror to his relief  illa usque minatur et tremefacta comam concusso vertice mutat for all the passions when they are very great carry fury along with them and all the afflicting passions together with fury carry vehemence and severity and the poet hereby setting his image in motion had set it before his eyes and so made it the more terrible let us now consider that of laocoon  laocoon ductus neptuno sort sacerdos sollennes taurum ingentem mactabat ad aras ecce autem gemini a tenedo tranquilla per alta horresco referens immensis orbibus angues incumbunt pelago pariterque ad littera tendunt pectora quorum inter fluctus arrecta jubaeque sanguineae exuperant undas pars cetera pontum pone legit sinuantque immensa volumine terga fit sonitus spumante salo jamque arva tenebant ardentesque oculos suffecti sanguine and igni sibila lambebant linguis vibrantibus ora diffugimus visu exangues illi agmine certo laocoonta petunt and primum parva duorum corpora natorum serpens anplexus uterque implicat and miseros morsu depascitur artus post ipsum auxilio subeuntem ac tela ferentem corripiunt spirisque ligant ingentibus and jam bis medium amplexi bis collo squamea circum terga dati superant capite and ceraicibus altis ille simul manibus tendit divellere nodos perfusus sanie vitas atroque veneno clamores simul horrendos ad sydera tollit quales mugitus fugit cum saucius aram taurns and incertam excussit cervice secarim which in english blank verse runs thus  laocoon now great neptunes priest by lot the solemn sacrifice a mighty bull prepared to slay when lo from tenedos two huge twin serpents of prodigious size a shivering horror chills all my life blood at the bare thought and freezes every nerve their monstrous folds incumbent on the main with equal haste come rolling toward the shore their spotty breasts erect above the waves and bloody crests look fearful to the eye their other parts come winding through the flood in many a waving spire the sea resounds while with the scaly horrors of their tayls they swinge the foaming brine and now they land now dart their flaming eyes distained with blood and streaming all with fire we pale and bloodless at the dismal sight all in a moment trembling disappear they to the priest direct their flaming way and of his little sons each seizing one around their limbs they twine their snaky spires and on their little trembling joints they feed a dismal feast and while their wretched sire with piercing shrieks comes rushing to their aid at him with fury both at once they dart and clasping him with their vast poisonous folds twice round his waste they twist and twice his neck and stretching over his head their dismal head and lofty crests upon the dying wretch they dreadfully look down he all in vain with all his might his brawny muscles strains and stretches his extended arms to tear the poisonous and inextricable folds and from their entrails squeezes horrid gore and now tormented hideously he roars and stamping stares from his distracted eyes thus madly bounds about the impetuous bull when from his wound he shakes the uncertain axe and bellowing from the bloody altar broke and now here we find a deal of enthusiasm which is nothing but the elevation and vehemence and fury proceeding from the great and terrible and horrible ideas for the poet setting his image in so much motion and expressing it with so much action his inflamed imagination set it before his very eyes so that he participated of the danger which he described was shaken by the terror and shivered with the horror and what is it but the expression of the passions he felt that moves the reader in such an extraordinary manner but here let us observe how the spirit of the poet rises as the danger comes nearer and the terror grows upon him  jamque aroa tenebint ardentesque oculos etc and now they land etc let us consider beside what prodigious force all this must have in the connection where religion adds to the terror increases the astonishment and augments the horror for twas by the direction of minerva that this terrible incident was brought about who had combined with juno to destroy the trojans as has been at large declared in a former critical treatise and thus we have endeavored to show how the enthusiasm proceeds from the thoughts and consequently from the subject but one thing we have omitted that as thoughts produce the spirit the spirit produces and makes the expression which is known by experience to all who are poets for never any one while he was wrapped with enthusiasm wanted either words or harmony and is selfevident to all who consider that the expression conveys and shows the spirit and therefore must be produced by it so that from what we have said we may venture to lay down this definition of poetical genius poetical genius in a poem is the true expressions of ordinary or enthusiastic passion proceeding from ideas to which it naturally belongs and poetical genius in a poet is the power of expressing such passion worthily and the sublime is a great thought expressed with the enthusiasm that belongs to it which the reader will find agreeable to the doctrine of cecilius longinus i must confess has not told us what the sublime is because cecilius it seems had done that before him tho methinks it was a very great fault in so great a man as longinus to write a book which could not be understood but by another mans writings especially when he saw that those writings were so very defective that they were not likely to last but tho longinus does not directly tell us what the sublime is yet in the first six or seven chapters of his book he takes a great deal of pains to set before us the effects which it produces in the minds of men as for example that it causes in them admiration and surprise a noble pride and a noble vigor an invincible force transporting the soul from its ordinary situation and a transport and a fullness of joy mingled with astonishment these are the effects that longinus tells us that the sublime produces in the minds of men now i have endeavored to show what it is in poetry that works these effects so that take the cause and the effects together and you have the sublime  chap viii recapitulation and that the subjects of the ancients in their greater poetry were sacred we have now shown that if the ancients excel the moderns in epick poetry in tragedy and in the greater ode they derive not their preeminence from any external nor from any internal advantage abstracted from the nature of the subject and that consequently they must draw it from the nature of the subject itself then we showed that the greatest difference between one subject and another is that of sacred and profane then we showed that passion was the chief thing in poetry and great passion in great poetry and that either ordinary passion or enthusiasm then we showed that sacred subjects were as susceptible of ordinary passion as the profane and more susceptible of the enthusiastic which last we showed by reason and by example so that to give a convincing reason why the ancients did and must for the most part excel the moderns in epick poetry in tragedy and the greater ode we have nothing to do but to show that those poems among the ancients were always sacred because it is very well known that among the moderns they are for the most part profane first then for tragedy that is very well known to have been sacred in its institution and it is full as plain that it must have been sacred in its original nature and after that the episodes began to entrench upon the chorus it still continued sacred as having apostrophes revelations invocations machines and so had the greater ode and as for epick poetry in that the eldest of the muses after the first invocation was believed to dictate every thing besides that the gods were every where introduced in it and all things were done by their ministry for which reason it is apparent that the moderns in these sort of poems writing upon profane subjects cannot possibly equal the ancients supposing these last to have had but an equal share of genius with them  chap ix that the ancient poets derived their preeminence from religion shown by several other things and first from this that they did not excel the moderns in poetry in which they made no use of religion that the ancients in the epos in the ode and in tragedy derived their preeminence from religion may appear from several things that have not yet been mentioned and first of all from this that they did not excel the moderns in poetry in which they drew no advantage from religion as in comedy and in satyr and that in historical poetry as the pharsalia of lucan whenever the ancients excelled the moderns they drew their advantage from religion  for comedy the ancients are so far from excelling the moderns in it that the advantage is clearly on our side for i shall make no scruple of preferring moliere and two or three of our own comic poets to terence and aristophanes for whether the design of comedy be to instruct or to please or both the modern comedy answers both those ends incomparably better than the ancient if the end of comedy be only to please why then it must please by the ridiculum for that which is the end of any sort of writing whatever must be attained by a way that must distinguish that sort of writing as for example the end of tragedy and of epick poetry is to instruct but the latter instructs chiefly by admiration and the former by compassion and terror now admiration distinguishes heroic poetry and compassion and terror tragedy from all other sorts of poems whatever but the only thing that distinguishes the pleasure which comedy gives us from the pleasure that we receive from all other sorts of poems whatever is the ridiculum now the ridiculum in the modern comedy is beyond comparison higher than it is in the new comedy of the ancients and beyond comparison more in nature than it is in the old one and it is higher both in the incidents and in the characters for if the end of comedy is to please and that end is to be attained by the ridiculum why then the ridiculum ought to be spread throughout it but besides that it is higher in the modern comedy there is a greater variety of it both in the incidents and in the characters and that variety must make it the more delightful for a uniformity in this case takes away from the surprise and without surprise the ridiculum cannot subsist and besides that the moderns have a greater variety both of characters and fables they have a greater variety of style for the style of the comedy of the ancients and particularly of terence his comedy does not seem to me to be varied enough nor proportioned enough to the characters the slave in terence speaks with the same elegance and the same grace for the most part that his master does but look into the plain dealer and you shall find as many styles in it as there are characters for manly freeman plansible oliviae novel elisha the widow blackacre and jerry have each of them a different dialect which besides the variety must be further delightful because it is an exact imitation of nature for as every man has a different form of face he has a different turn of mind and consequently a different cast of thought and a different manner of expression add to this that the moderns seem to know men better and to dive into some latent foibles into some ridiculous recesses that were utterly unknown to the ancients so that in every good comedy at the same time that we are diverted with the ridiculum we are entertained with discoveries which is very delightful but if the chief design of comedy be to instruct as i make no question but it is because public spectacles ought to contribute to the public advantage we shall find that the modern comedy arswers this end too better than that of the ancients if the design of comedy be to instruct it must instruct by the ridiculum for the very same reason that we affirmed it must please by it because it is to be distinguished by the means by which it attains its end but nothing but the ridiculum can distinguish comedy from all other poems but comedy instructing by the ridiculum that ridiculum ought to be both in the fables and characters first it ought to be in the characters or else it cannot be in the incidents and consequently there can be no comedy for the manners of the agents produce the incidents secondly it ought to be in the incidents or else it would follow that there would be manners in the agents which are not productive of action which ought not to be besides comedy instructs by its fables or characters or both if it instructs only by its characters as some critics have thought yet the ridiculum ought to be in the action too or the seriousness of the incidents would check the instruction as well as the pleasure which we receive from the characters but if it instructs by its fable and action as certainly it ought to do why then the ridiculum must be in the incidents which are parts of the action because comedy instructs by the ridiculum and consequently this last ought to reign chiefly in the catastrophe which ought to be the most instructive part of the fable and to make the strongest impression besides there are but two ways of instructing by example and those are the showing men ridiculous for their faults or unfortunate to represent them exposed by them or chastisd for them but if comedy shows men unfortunate it usurps upon tragedy the great disorders of the world are caused by great passions and they are punished by tragedy the little passions cause little disquiets and make us uneasy to our selves and one another and they are exposed by comedy for that which we call humor in comedy is nothing but a little ridiculous passion and the exposing it in comedy is thought to be poetical justice sufficient for it not but that at last the characters in comedy may be chastised at the catastrophe for faults which they have committed but that very chastisement ought to be wrapped up in the ridiculum or the catastrophe cannot be truly comical for as the catastrophe of a tragedy ought to be the most tragical part of it because tragedy instructing by compassion and terror those two passions ought to be most strongly moved in the most instructive part of the fable so the catastrophe of a comedy ought to be the most comical part of it for the very same reason for comedy instructing by the ridiculum as has been shown above the most instructive part of it ought to be most ridiculous but now if it is the end of comedy to instruct and it instructs by the ridiculum the modern comedy must be more instructive than the ancient could be for the ridiculum in the old comedy of the ancients was very often out of nature both in the characters and in the incidents and consequently could not instruct and the ridiculum in their new comedy being not so strong as it is in ours neither in their characters not in their incidents could not insttuct so powerfully and the moderns having greater variety of it both in their persons and action the instruction in the modern comedy must be the more extensive besides that the variety of action and incidents must make our catastrophes more surprising and consequently more ridiculous  so that the modern comedy pleasing more and instructing more and so answering the two ends of comedy better than the ancient did it follows that the moderns in comedy are preferrable to the ancients  as the moderns have excelled the ancients in comedy they have equaled them in satyr there has been a long dispute among the critics whether horace or juvenal ought to be preferred in satyr their excellencies indeed are are very different and therefore a comparison is not easy to be made horace had a great deal of pleasantry and juvenal a great deal of force at least for his way of writing now boilean has justly got a great reputation both for force and pleasantry and consequently is equal to either of the roman satyrists and here it will not be amiss to observe that the very same poets among the moderns who have surpassed the ancients in comedy and who have equaled them in satyr have fallen infinitely short of them when they have attempted the greater poetry as ben johnson comes behind them in tragedy and boilean in the greater ode  as for historical poetry any one who is acquainted with lucan may have observed that where that author is very great he derives his greatness from religion as he does for example in catos speech which is a kind of abstract of the religion and metaphysics of the stoics  ille deo plenus

these inspiring sounds to roman actions call lucan is very far from being so exalted every where as he is here for wherever he is very great and poetical he must be so by the greatness of ordinary passion or by the force of enthusiasm but ordinary passions can neither be very frequent in an historical poem nor if they could could they be frequently great because there being no fable and no art they can seldom be rightly prepared nor can the enthusiasms be frequently great where there is no religion but religion cannot be frequent in an historical poem unless it is in sacred history if any one would give himself the trouble of comparing the twelfth book of the aeneis with the seventh of the pharsalia he would find that virgil is ten times greater than lucan and that lucans subject as far as it is humane is ten times greater than virgils for i hope no man will compare aeneas take him without his divine dependencies with julius caesar the greatest of men nor the combat that made the former king of the latins with the battle that made caesar the absolute master of the world from whence it would follow if the greatness of virgils subject consists in any thing humane that either lucans writing in his seventh book is twenty times below his subject or that the writing of virgil in his twelfth book is twenty times above his but lucans writing in his seventh book is not twenty times below his subject as any modern poet that should be obliged to handle that subject after him would be forced to confess nor is the writing of virgil in the last of the aeneis so many degrees above his subject for if it is then that last book is scurvily writ because the thoughts and expressions ought to be proportioned to the things but the last book of the aeneis is admirably writ what then can be the meaning of all this why the meaning must be that virgils subject is twenty times greater than lucans but lucans subject is ten times greater than his as far as it is only humane which has been made to appear the excellency then of virgils subject must come from something that is not humane and that must be from religion so virgils greatness and his enthusiasm comes from his machines and the ministry of the gods and the other parts of his religion and lucans littleness from his want of those machines and that ministry petronius arbiter lucans contemporary was very sensible of this for he tho an epicurean professed was so sensible of the advantage that poetry derived from religion that in the beginning of his satyricon after he has been exclaiming against the writers of the times and particularly against lucan he offers this expedient for the restoring poetry to its former greatness that they should restore it to its former religion but to return to lucan he is often tedious and spiritless because his subject is not only merely humane but it is sometimes impious for lucan had conceived the most extravagant design in the world for at the same time that he sets up for a stoic he writes a book to prove either that there is no such thing as providence in the world or that the gods favored injustice  victrix causa deis placuit sed vict a catoni before i make an end of this chapter i beg the readers leave that i may digress for a moment because the digression is of very great importance to poetry  we have shown that the subject of virgil in the twelfth of his aeneis is very much greater than lucans is in the seventh of his pharsalia we have shown too at the same time that lucans was greater as he found it and that virgils was greater as he made it for i hope i need say nothing at this time of day to prove that the religious part of virgils subject was invented and disposed by the poet which may show the benefit of art that is of rules in poetry for tho it is by the genius of a writer that is by a soul that has the power of expressing great passions whether ordinary or enthusiastic that we treat a subject with dignity equal to its greatness yet it is art that makes a subject very great and consequently gives occasion for a great genius to show it self  and thus we have shown that the ancients did not excel the moderns in comedy and satyr which are not sacred poems as having neither invocations apostrophes revelations or machines at least the new comedy had none of all these and the old one only some low burlesque or else grotesque ones we have shown too that the sacred poetry of the ancients was beyond comparison greater than their historical poetry because it was not sacred  chap x that in their sacred poetry in which the ancients excelled the moderns those places were greatest and most poetical that had most of religion but as the ancients did not surpass the moderns in poetry that was not sacred so in that sort of poetry where they did excel them they were never so admirable as where they were most religious now the passages of the ancient poets which seem to have most religion in them are either those addresses by which men approached the gods as invocations apostrophes and the like or those condescensions by which the gods communicated themselves to men as revelations machines etc the first of which are duties that belong to universal natural religion the second to religion which is revealed extraordinary and miraculous every thing that is great in poetry must be great by the genius that is felt in it which is the chief thing in poetry according to the general acceptance of it and the principal thing in the materia poetica or the body of poetry now all genius is passion because it moves and all passion is either enthusiasm or ordinary passion as we declared above now that even ordinary passion in poetry is heightened by religion we shall endeavor to prove and we shall most insist upon those ordinary passions which are most to be found in tragedy and in epick poetry for as for the greater ode that seems to be the peculiar province of enthusiasm and ordinary passions in that are more rarely to be met with  first then admiration which is the reigning passion in epick poetry i mean that which is admirable in the action of the hero is heightened by revelations by machines and the ministration of the gods for that ministration those machines and those revelations are all miraculous and the man who was admirable before for his extraordinary valor and his native greatness becomes more wonderful when we behold him the esteem and immediate concern of heaven when we see him the peculiar care of providence when we find the order of nature inverted the skies grown factious upon his account and gods descending to sustain or oppose him  but secondly terror and compassion which are the reigning passions in tragedy are heightened by religion tragedy says aristotle in his poetic is the imitation of an action which excites compassion and terror now those two passions proceed from surprise when the incidents spring one from another against our expectation for those incidents continues the philosopher are always more admirable than those which arrive by chance which is evident from this says he that even of accidental things those are always the most wonderful and most surprising which at the same time that they arrive by chance seem to fall out by design and by a certain particular secret conduct of which nature was what they relate of the statue of mitys at argos which fell upon his murderer and killed him upon the spot in the midst of a great assembly for that by no means says the philosopher seems to be the work of chance from whence ir follows says he of necessity that those fables where there is this conduct will always seem preferable to those that have it not thus aristotle declares that the wonderful in tragedy as well as in epick poetry is heightened by religion that those tragical incidents that appear to have most of providence in them are always most moving and terrible the reason is plain for all cur passions are grounded upon the love of our selves and terror and compassion spring from the calamities of our equals that is of those who being in circumstances resembling ours and committing faults which we either commit or to which we are liable are upon that unfortunate for the more there appears to be of providence in the punishment the more we pity the persons for if their calamities appear to be the work of chance they might as well have happened to those who have not committed such faults as to those who have and therefore a train of incidents which contrary to our expectation surprizingly produce one another is necessary because the more plainly the punishment appears the result of the faults and the more clearly we are convinced of this when we least expect it providence appears the more in the case and our security is shaken the more and the more we are moved and terrified but religion does not only heighten those passions which are great in themselves as admiration and terror are for admiration raises the soul and every thing that is terrible is certainly great to him to whom it is terrible but it ennobles those which are commonly base and dejected as for example grief witness that passage in the passion of dido  testatur moritura deos and conscia fati sydera and that noble apostrophe afterward  sol qui terrarem flammis etc and that sublime apostrophe of seinon in the second book  ille dolis instructus and art pelasga sustulit exutas vinclis ad sydera palmas vos eterni ignes and non violabile vestrum numen ait vos arae ensesque nefandi quos fugi vittaeque deum quas hostia gessi etc but to come to the other sort of passion which gives poetry its force and its greatness religious enthusiasm must necessarily be greater than human enthusiasm can be because the passions that attend on religious ideas when a man is capable of reflecting on them as he should do are stronger than those which attend on profane ideas as has been said above and has been partly shown by examples and as ordinary passion is heightened by religion so human enthusiastic passions are heightened by religious enthusiasm we shall give an example of this in terror by which i mean not that common passion which aristotle treats of in his rhetoric and in his poetic and of which we spoke in the former part of this chapter but that enthusiastic terror which springs from the ideas unknown to him who feels it virgil in his first book of the aeneis describes a tempest which carries double terror along with it the ordinary one which springs from the concern which we have for the hero and the enthusiastic one which the ideas would carry along with them tho they were separated from that concern which we feel for the hero the description is grave and severe and exalted because the poet was moved by the terrible ideas for that which is terrible is always great to him to whom it is terrible as we said before and that which is great is admirable and then he who is terrified is always serious and very much in earnest the same description where the terror is at the height is vehement  insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons hi summo in fluctu pendent his unda dehiscens terram inter fluctus aperit furit aestus arenis because that which is very terrible is wonderful and astonishing and he who is astonished being transported beyond himself must of necessity express himself with that sort of fury which we call vehemence virgil by setting so many terrible images in motion had set this tempest before his eyes or rather had transported himself as it were into it now any one who has been upon the brink of a wreck and consequently has been very much terrified himself and seen others astonished cannot but have felt the same motions that he feels in reading this passage and cannot but have observed that others who felt them expressed themselves with the same fury and vehemence that the poet does tho not with the same elegance but tho this storm is terrible in it self and wonderful yet the machines which prepare and raise and allay it very much add to its greatness and genuine terror and it is quite another thing when it is considered with the cause of it which is the anger of juno and the compliance of aeolus and with that which followed upon it which is the indignation of neptune and the exertion of his absolute power  the passages of the ancient poets that were most religious were their invocations apostrophes or the like or those which contained the miraculous part of their religion their signs apparitions oracles and other revelations  for their invocations apostrophes and the like which were all of them either a sort of prayers or divine attestations they are most of them very sublime and attended with a strong enthusiasm and how could it be otherwise but that the ancient poets who were men of great learning of great passions great eloquence and great parts when with study and pains and with all their endeavors to be enthusiastic they addressed themselves to their gods should be extremely agitated when we see very plainly that a sort of modern enthusiasts who have neither learning nor parts nor the least tincture of good letters are even in their extempore prayers disturbed with very fierce enthusiasms  for the apostrophe we have given examples of it already and therefore we shall only say here that longinus mentions it as one of the figures that contribute the most to the sublime for the invocation we shall bring an example of it from the seventh book of virgil and the reader is desired to take notice what addition of enthusiasm attends it  nunc age qui reges erato quae tempora rerum quis latio antiquo fuerit status advena classem cum primum ausoniis exercitus appulit oris expediam and primae revocabo exordia pugnae tu natem tu diva moan dicam horrida bella dicam acies actosque animis in funera reges tyrrhenamque manum totamque sub arma coactam hesperiam major rerum mihi nascitur ordo majus opus mo and from horace lib   ode    descend coelo and dic age tibia regina long am calliope melos seu voce nunc mavis acuta seu fidibus citharave phoebi auditis an me ludit amabilis insania audire and videor pios errare per lucos amoenae quos and aqua subeunt and aura but to come to those passages of the ancient poems in which the miraculous part of their religion was contained and their revelation more nearly concerned as their signs and wonders and their private inspirations but above all the apparitions of their gods and their oracles it is no wonder if those passages speaking of things that strike mankind with the last astonishment have almost all the enthusiasm of which the mind of man is with reason capable horace is by no means a cold writer and yet he is far from writing every where with the same degree of fury and the same rapture that he does in the beginning of the nineteenth ode of the second book  baccham in remotis carmina rupibus vidi docentem credit posteri nymphasque discentes and aures capripedum satyrorum acutas evae recenti mens trepidat metu plenoque bacchi pectore turbidum letatur evae parce liber parce gravi metuende thyrso nor is virgil every where so enthusiastic as he is in the beginning of the sixth book where the cumaean sibyl rages with the delphick god  ventum er at ad limen cum virgo poscere sata tempus ait deus ecce deus cui talia fanti ante fores subito non vultus non color unus non comtae mansere contae sed pectus anhelum et rabie fera corda tument majorque videri nee mortale sonans afflata est numine quando jam propiore dei the hero now the sacred floor approached when on a sudden the prophetic maid this is the fearful time to enquire of fate and said it with a voice and with a look that now were hers no more for raving lo the god the god she cries while half disclosing her distorted face her tresses in a wild disorder stare and now she pants she swells she foams with rage and now her shape looks hideous to the eye and now she thunders in a dreadful tone while all the godhead raging in her breast with his tempestuous spirit shakes her soul in short any thing that immediately concerns revelation has so great an influence upon poetry that it is able to change even the nature of writing and exalt that very sort of poetry which by its character is low and humble as for example the eclogue the fourth eclogue of virgil will be easily granted by all to be very sublime but what is it that makes it so why there is at once in that eclogue an invocation and an apostrophe and a revelation of sundry miracles to come the fifth eclogue between menalcas and mopsus begins with all the humility and all the simplicity that is proper and peculiar to the eclogue  men cur non mopse boni quoniam convenimus ambo tu calamos in flare leves ego diecre versus hic corilis mixtas inter consedimus ulmos and thus mr duke has with the same simplicity translated it  men mopsus since chance does us together bring and you so well can pipe and i can sing why sit we not beneath this secret shade by elms and hazels mingling branches made but this very menalcas changes his tone in a wonderful manner when in the same eclogue he comes to the apotheosis of daphnis  candidus insueti miratur limen olympi sub pedibusque videt nubes and sydera daphnis and you may easily see that the gentleman who translated it who wants no genius felt the extreme alteration of the spirit  daphnis now wondering at the glorious show over heavens bright pavement does triumphant go and sees the moving clouds and the fixed stars below but let us see a little how virgil goes on  ergo alacris sylvas and caetera rura voluptas panaque pastoresque tenet dryadasque puellas nic lupus insidias pecori nec retia cervis ulla dolum meditantur amat bonus otia daphnis therefore new joys make glad the woods the plains pan and the dryades and the cheerful swains the wolf no ambush for the flock does lay no cheating nets the harmless deer betray daphnis a general peace commands and nature does obey but virgil goes on  ipsi letitia voces ad sydera jactant intonsi montes ipsae jam carmina rupes ipsa sonant arbusta deus deus ille menalca sis bonus o foelixque tuis hark the glad mountains raise to heaven their voice hark the hard rocks in mystic tunes rejoice hark through the thickets wondrous songs resound a god a god menalcas he is crowned o be propitious o be good to thine but now it is time to ask a question what is the reason that virgil who knew the character of the eclogue better than any man and who was so thoroughly convinced that the discourses of shepherds ought to be simple and their affections soft and gentle affections and who besides has been always used to introduce his persons speaking perfectly in their characters should bring in menalcas in this eclogue talking in so exalted a manner and with so strong an enthusiasm why he has given the reason in the preceding verses  ipsae jam carmina rupes ipsa sonant arbusta deus deus ille menalca it is that he was satisfied that very violent enthusiasms flow so necessarily from the wonders of religion that they were as natural to shepherds as they were to kings as being to both alike unavoidable but what influence the miraculous part of religion had on the ancient poetry we shall discover more at large in the following chapter  chap x that the grecian poetry flourished with their religion the grecian religion flourished in greece from the time of orpheus who was either the original instituter or at least a vehement propogater of that idolatry till the age after that in which sophocles flourished that is for the space of about eight hundred years and in that space of time flourished all their poets who are celebrated for their excellence in that sort of poetry which we call sacred which alone is a strong presumption that these poets derived their excellence from religion in short the advantage which their poetry drew from religion must needs be very considerable when for all or most of the forementioned space of time according to the testimony of plutatch and several others of their authentic writers it made most of their zealots even their common people poets and that even in their ordinary conversation i must confess the gentleman who writ the history of oracles treats this as a fiction and a fiction so palpable as not to be worth the answering but perhaps that gentleman had not considered this matter enough for i desire the reader to consider two things first the extraordinary incentives which those people had to enthusiasm which is one qualification for poetry and secondly the habit which they might very probably contract of versification to be satisfied of the first let us enquire a little into the nature of their religion and upon enquiry we shall find that the very source and spring and soul of it was an imaginary or pretended revelation and that that revelation was supposed to be constant and continual as it must be of every religion which has no sound morality they had their public and private revelations as oracles visions dreams apparitions and gods and goddesses nymphs and demigods fawns and satyrs were seen by imagination in every grove on every mountain and in every valley as soon as either the horrors of the place or its silence or their fears or their wishes or their contemplations had disposed their minds to be religiously imposed upon now what sort of passions and what sort of spirit must be produced in them by these imaginations we may guess by what happens among our selves when any one believes that he has seen an apparition the man is altered quite in a moment his color his mein his comportment are all different nor are they who hear him the same but are all of them surpised transported astonished and all of them very profoundly attentive now very few that have any judgment have any notion that an apparition will do them any harm nor has any one an example of it that may be easily credited but the ancient grecians had notions that their gods had power to destroy them or make them happy and they had a thousand examples of it in museus and orpheus and homer and the rest of the fathers of their church which must cause the emotions upon the fancied apparitions or the relations of them to be the greater and fill their souls with more turbulent passions and a greater religious horror  but then let us consider secondly that these zealots must in some measure have contracted a habit of versisication from their religious duties for the very common people in greece had with quick apprehensions a great deal of vivacity and therefore i leave the reader to guess what effect the reading museus and homer and orpheus and the rest of the fathers of their church for their whole lifetime must necessarily have had upon their minds together with their praying praising sacrificing and thanksgiving in verse why may not they very well be supposed from all this to have contracted a habit of versifying  and why may not that habit joined to their continual enthusiastic motions which they had either from the revelations which they fancied that the gods imparted to themselves or from the relations of those which they believed were vouchsafed to others or from the performance of the foresaid religious duties and from their ritual which their poets had composed with so much enthusiasm capacitate them to express themselves poetically even in common society as well as some whole sects of our modern fanatics in england who have by no means the vivacity of the grecians are enabled from the continual reading of scripture and the imaginary dictates of the private spirit to make up their ordinary conversation almost wholly of scripture language  but since these visions and these apparitions joined to their constant reading the poets had such a mighty influence upon the people what must they not have had upon their priests the poets who having stronger pretenses to those revelations and more earnest and eager application to the reading of the poets who writ before them and who besides having strong imaginations and great passions and still greater souls to command them were qualified to draw an extraordinary advantage from them when these whose peculiar business it was to take care of religion at any time writ upon religious matters what gravity what severity what elevation what vehemence must they not necessarily derive from their subject  chap xii objection answered but here it is convenient to answer an objection for here it will be urged that the ancient poets among the grecians being men of extraordinary parts could not believe any thing so absurd as the revelations and miracles mentioned in the former chapter and consequently could not draw any advantage from them to which i answer that first they might draw an advantage from them tho they did not believe them and secondly that they did believe them  first supposing they did not believe them yet they might very well draw their advantage from them for every one is brought up in the revealed religion of his country and consequently believes it for the first part of his life now every one knows that the force of education and the influence of first impressions is great and especially upon the minds of those who have strong imaginations and supposing that the poets when they set themselves to write were not satisfied about the truth of the revelations of which they treated yet the former strong enthusiastic motions that they were wont to have upon the like ideas in the first years of their youth would certainly follow upon them again whenever they had heartily a mind to give into them  but secondly a man may have a very good understanding and yet believe a false nay even an absurd revelation the revelation of mahomet is both false and absurd and yet several among the turks who have shown themselves men of extraordinary parts for several years together have at last convinced the world of the sincerity of their belief by very frankly submitting to die at the command of their emperors when they could with a great deal of ease have declined it for it is so reasonable to believe that there should be such a thing as revelation of which we shall speak more at large anon and all revelations are so little to be comprehended by us that a man even of a good understanding will be obliged to believe an absurd one rather than none besides the ancient grecian poets knew no other religion than the grecian revelation for they had neither any clear idea of one supreme independent being nor any tolerable knowledge of the law of nature for all the great poets among the grecians flourished before the doctrine of socrates was established in the world and before that establishment they had neither any certain knowledge of the true god nor any tolerable notion of the law of nature for had there been that there would have been a system of morality but socrates was the first who introduced moral philosophy into that part of the world  and here the mythologists may pretend as long as they please that the ancient grecian poets by the number of their false gods meant only the different notions of the true it is plain they had no clear and distinct idea of one supreme and infinite being for either the knowledge of the true god must be drawn from reason or revelation from revelation they could not draw it because their own revelation was not true and if they had the knowledge of the true god from any other revelation of which perhaps some of them might have heard imperfectly why then that knowledge was imperfect and could consequently not be clear and to deduce that knowledge from reason a man must use a great deal of attention and a great deal of application but in those times the corruption of the grecians was too great and their passions were too strong and the exercise of reason was too little known among them to use either the attention or the application but besides all this there is something in the ancient grecian poets that is repugnant to the divine nature as is known to every one who has been conversant with them and that alone renders all the conjectures of the mythologists ridiculous  and lastly we have a great deal of reason to be convinced that the ancient grecian poets i mean their sacred poets did believe the revelations they neated of because as their poetry flourished with their revelation so at last it failed with it as we shall show at large in the following chapter  chap xiii that the greater poetry among the graecians failed with their religion as epick poetry tragedy and the greater ode flourished with religion among the ancient grecians so together with religion they failed now in order to the proving this let us enquire how and when the grecian religion failed we have said in one of the former chapters that the very spring and soul of that religion was a constant continual revelation as it must necessarily have been of such a religion as had no morality the grecians worshipped many gods but before they worshipped them they must believe that they were and that they wanted neither power nor will to make them either happy or miserablc now of these two things they were convinced by imaginary or pretended revelations as by oracles visions dreams apparitions and a thousand fantastic miracles now as long as these were in credit in greece polytheism went on triumphantly for they who had neither any insight into the true religion nor any tolerable habit of reasoning could never argue against matter of fact as long as they made no doubt of the truth of it but as soon as the matter of fact came to be suspected the grecian worship was undermined and weakened very considerably to be convinced of this we need only consider the design of that revelation and the methods of carrying it on and we shall find that that very design and those very methods made a certain way for its ruin we have said above that no religion which wants morality can outlast its revelation for if morality is not for it it will be against it and it is impossible to conceive how any religion can be permanent which has neither miracles nor human reason to support it now it will be an easy matter to show two things first that the grecian religion was without motality and secondly that the very design of it and the methods of carrying on that design introduced moral philosophy by a very natural preparation  the design of the grecian religion seems to me to be the providing for the happiness of mankind in this life by drawing them out of a state of war and making them live peaceably and securely among one another  sylvestres homines sacer interpresque deorum caedibus and victu faedo deterruit orpheus says horace in his little treatise de art poetica that is  orpheus the sacred interpreter of the gods deterred savage men from murdering one another and reclaimed them from the barbarous brutal lives which they led now this design he was to bring about by religion and revealing the pretended will of the gods in order to which it was necessary to give the people such a religion as might be agreeable to them in the condition in which they were for otherwise they would not have hearkened to it now to give them a religion that might be agreeable to them it was necessary to give them such a one as might maintain and indulge their passions for when the grecian worship was first instituted the corruption of that people was so very great that tho the instituter had known the pure law of nature he durst never have preached it to them because their passions were then too strong to receive it well then orpheus or linus or whoever was the first instituter of the grecian religion was obliged to maintain and indulge the passions which i am apt to believe that he had no notion of suppressing because he believed them all to be natural and saw by experience that some of them contributed to the pleasure and happiness of mankind the instituter then of the grecian worship was obliged to maintain the passions but here lay the difficulty the very crimes that kept men asunder and in a state of war were caused by some of those very passions what then was to be done in this case why he was obliged to give those passions a diversion and to indulge and maintain the rest in the same condition in which he found them as for example rage and fury were the principal passions that maintained men in a state of war and occasioned the frequent murders that were daily committed among them now these passions being grown up with them and by consequence become habitual to them it would have been very difficult if not impossible to suppress them the first instituter then of the grecian religion thought fit to give those passions a vent a less cruel way and for that purpose in all likelihood instituted the orgies of bacchus but the passions that were not utterly inconsistent with society he indulged in the condition in which he found them as the love of women wine etc for all that the founder of that religion could pretend to at first was to bring men out of a greater confusion into a less and not to reduce them to perfect order therefore by showing the gods addicted to these passions he encouraged the people to cherish them nay to such an intemperance as was repugnant to the original law of nature nay even to such a criminal degree as was afterward forbidden by the laws of the grecian states for intemperance in the use of wine and of women is contrary to the dictates of natures original law and yet was encouraged by the examples of some of their gods and rapes and adulteries and incest were encouraged by the same examples at first without any manner of countercheck for either the system of the grecian theology was contrived at first without any infernal punishments or they were only threatened to such crimes as were contradictory of civil society but afterward as confusion lessened and order increased and other crimes were found to be more repugnant to community and so were forbidden by the laws the magistrates in all likelihood obliged the succeeding poets to threaten those who dared to commit them with the punishments of another world and so to make up the infernal scheme by degrees thus have i endeavored to show by the most probable conjectures i could make what was the original design of orpheus and what method he took to compass it but this is past all doubt that the original revelation of the grecian worship was repugnant in several points to the primitive law of nature and the succeeding laws of the grecian states now the method which orpheus or whoever was the first founder of the grecian religion had taken was maintained by succeeding poets only here and there as occasion served they intermingled precepts of justice and temperance which precepts are by no means to be looked upon as parts of that revelation but as remnants of natural religion and of the law of nature which the passions had not been able totally to suppress or the efforts and strugglings of reason recovering from its lethargy by degrees but the poets and lawgivers could not give good precepts with a great deal of good success as long as the gods were believed to give ill examples for the people looked upon their laws unless they were enforced by religion as made only for the convenience of life and trangsgrest them whenever they could with impunity and the precepts scat terd up and down in the poems were but impotent imperfect efforts of reason and utterly unable to prevail against a continual constant revelation and a train of perpetual miracles  but now let us consider how this design of orpheus or whoever was the first instituter of the grecian religion let us see how his design in setting up his theology together with the methods that were used for carrying it on by him and succeeding poets secretly prepared the way for its utter ruin for the bringing men in a body together and causing them more frequently to converse with one another was the first occasion of the cultivating humane reason and was consequently one preparation to the introduction of moral philosophy  and the laws that were made by their legislators and the precepts that were given by their priests and poets in consequence of mens convening and conversing together had been sensible encroachments upon the revelation as being manifest contradictions of it if men had been used to reflect at last after miracles and revelations had prevailed for the space of almost eight hundred years socrates arose a most extraordinary man who finding that the precepts that had been scattered here and there for the regulation of humane life and the laws that had been given for the maintaining of order in communities were all contradictory of the revelation but all agreeing perfectly with one another in the promoting of the same design which was the welfare of those who observed them he had reason to enquire a little more narrowly into the revelation and to find that that was contradictory too of it self for the celestial and the infernal schemes of the ancient grecian theology seemed so utterly inconsistent that as i hinted before they could never be conceived to be both given out at a time but it was reasonable to believe that first the celestial scheme was invented and afterward the infernal made up by degrees in order to the serving the ends of government for not only the infernal deities rigorously punished those very crimes which the celestial gods had by their examples encouraged men to commit but which is very odd to consider their hell seemed to be filled with their good gods and their heaven with devils for whether we consider plato or proserpine or the judges or the fates or the furies these were all of them very rigorous and if you please inexorable but then they were all of them very just and foes and inexorabie only to guilt and never any of them did any harm to virtue but at the same time that the magistracy of hell was composed of these honest upright persons heaven on the other side was filled with all sorrs of scoundrels rakes cuckolds bullies pimps and bawds and cuckold makers and no virtue and no innocence could secure either men or women from these immortal scowrers nay men often suffered for their temperance and women for their chastity socrates then considering the absurdity of the revelation and the reasonableness of the laws and precepts that were distinct from it the agreement of the latter among themselves and the inconsistency of the former cultivated the one and contemned the other and by the force of a strong and clear reason and a long conversation with all sorts of people brought the exercise and habit of reasoning into request and by little and little introduced a system of morality restored in some measure natural religion and recovered the law of nature thus socrates gave the world a system of morality and tho his contemporaries had not reason enough to make the discovery themselves yet they had sense enough to approve of it when it was made and to be convinced of the truth of it and consequently to be satisfied that the revelation was false for seeing that virtue and order and happiness i mean in some degree sprung from philosophy and vice and confusion and misery from the revelation and seeing the philosophy was established by inferences which very naturally flowed from these intelligent faculties which whatever power had formed man had given him to be his guide and seeing the philosophy and the revelation contradictory one of another they could not find in their hearts to believe that the gods could be so unjust as to design the misery and confusion of mankind or so absurd as to give them two rules to walk by that were contradictory one of another  the establistment then of moral philosophy was the ruin of the old revelation and so made way for a new for after the death of socrates there started up several sects of philosophers as the cyrenaicks cynicks peripateticks epicureans scepticks some of them immediately but all within a hundred and fifty years who were all of them mortal enemies not only to the grecian revelation but to revealed religion in general tho in the last they certainly went beyond the design of their common master socrates whose intention was to reform revelation and not to ruin it and thus upon the establishment of moral philosophy the credit of oracles was diminished considerably and apparitions visions etc were contemned and exploded and with them down went the greater poetry for you will find upon enquiry that there was no poet among the grecians who was born after the death of socrates who writ with a great spirit  chap xiv that the greater poetry among the romans flourished and failed with their religion that the grecians derived their preeminence in the greater poetry from religion may appear not only because they flourished and decayed together but because the romans whose country was not like greece the scene of perpetual miracles and who for a long time had no correspondence with greece had no such thing as the spirit of poetry among them till they came to conquer that country  graecia capta ferum victorem caepit and arts insulit agresti latio for there was something in the institution of the roman religion as it was established by numa pamphilius that lessened the credit of divine apparitions considerably it is true numa founded his sacred establishment upon the authority of apparitions but at the same time that he professed a familiarity with the goddess aegeria and with the muses plut life of numa he taught the people that no resemblance of the gods could be made nor any likeness to represent them the first was a fiction to serve a turn in politics and the latter a truth that was contradictory of the other and he had need have very gross people to deal with that could swallow such a contradiction as that for if no form or likeness of the gods could be made in what likeness could they appear to him or how could he distinguish aegeria from the muses or the muses from one another i am apt to believe that numa ventured this contradiction upon the grossness of the people with whom he had to deal because the truth and fiction were equally necessary to his ecclesiastical policy for as his authority was grounded upon the fiction so it was strengthened by the truth for the appearing of the immortal powers to numa had not made him so venerable if such apparitions had been common to every one however this contradiction was swallowed by the people and numa upon it gained both his points for he was held to be a sacred person and the gods were esteemed invisible so that for a hundred and sixty years says plutarch in the life of numa there was no such thing as a statue in their temples nor any talk of the gods appearing to them for how could those numerous gods whom they worshipped with any possibility appear to them since they could make no likeness of them at length the superstition of the grecian idolatry by degrees increased upon them and having conquered greece and carthage and so got an insight into the arts and leisure at once to cultivate them the grecian religion and the grecian arts grew up together among them and of all the arts poetry was the first that was cultivated because it was incorporated with their religion so that thereappears to me to be this considerable difference between the greater poetry of the grecians and that which was among the romans that the grecians derived their poetic enthusiasm from the miracles of their religion and the romans borrowed theirs in some measure from the grecians  spiritum graiae tenuem camenae parca non mendax dedit etc hor lib   ode    so that the latter appears to me to be but a copy as it were of the former for in effect the romans copied the grecian spirit for we have shown from horace the best of the roman critics that the romans had no such thing among them till they had conquered greece nor had they any such frequent impulses to enthusiasm and having the same revelation at the time that they cultivated poetry that the grecians had they could hardly say any thing of their gods or their demigods or their fabulous transformations that the grecian poets had not said before them besides the most famous of the roman poets copied particular grecian authors as horace did pindar and consequently fell short of them in the freeness and flame of their spirit as copies must necessarily do of originals and as for the tragedies that were among the romans the best of them were directly translated from the athenian poets  since then the roman poets copied the grecian spirit what is the reason that the romans copied them so much better than we do why first they understood them better and were more familiar with them because then the grecian was a living language and rome had a continual correspondence with athens secondly they had a more beautiful and more harmonious language to receive that spirit and lastly and chiefly that religion from which it was derived made greater impressions upon them than it does upon us and in order to the making that appear we shall show that poetry among the romans flourished and failed with religion  poetry began to be cultivated at rome after the conquest of greece and the end of the thid punick war  serus enim graecis admovit acumina chartis et post punica belli quietus quaerere cepit quid sophocles and thespis and aeschylus aetile ferrent now nothing is more reasonable than to believe that the grecian superstition from which the spirit of their poetry was derived was at a greater height at rome after the romans had conquered the grecians than it could be before they had a continual correspondence with that people but besides religion in the main may be thought to be in a very great esteem among the romans about the time that they began to cultivate poetry  in order to the proving which let us enquire what was the fountain and source of religion among the romans and upon what it chiefly depended the chief support of religion among the grecians was the constant revelation by oracles but the italian oracles were more rare and of much less renown the prop and support of the roman superstition lay in their divinations as machiavel in his discourses observes for says machiavel they easily believed that that divinity that foretold their felicity had the power to effect it machiavel had reason to be of that opinion for how could their gods be thought certainly to foretell what it was not in their power certainly to effect and thus did the roman worship depend in a very peculiar manner upon the credit of their divinations but now let us enquire in what credit the divinations were when poetry began to be cultivated which as we observed above was after the third punick war  now the credit of the augurs and the aruspices must needs at that time be very great with the romans for since good fortune alone inclines men to devotion and to confide in the gods as aristotle has observed in the second book of his rhetoric what thoughts must not the romans have of their soothsaying when they were not only arrived at such a degree of felicity but believed that they owed all their greatness to the predictions of their augurs for they consulted them upon every important conjuncture and particularly before they gave battle it is true they had sometimes failed but where they had failed once they had succeeded ten times which is evident from the felicity of that commonwealth now if one lucky guess can support our ordinary fortunetellers who are wretched contemptible bonds against a hundred that happen unfortunate as we know by experience it does in what height of reputation must not the soothsayers be whose order it self was held to be sacred and august when they had apparently succeeded ten times for their failing once the romans were now become the greatest people upon the earth and the promise of romulus revealed to proculus according to the oath of the latter that rome should be the mistress of nations that promise which at first seemed so very incredible was now very likely to be accomplished and the romans believed that they had been conducted by the predictions of those diviners as it were by so many steps to that height of glory at which they were in triumph arrived and from the which they had a certain prospect of becoming mastersof the universe  divination then being in very great credit in the age in which poetry began to be cultivated religion which had its chief dependence upon it must consequently needs be in very great credit too which was the thing that we designed to prove  but from what has been said it necessarily follows that any one that should have brought divination into disgrace must have given a terrible shock to the superstition of the romans now about a hundred and threescore years after poetry began to be cultivated being introduced by livius andronicus there flourished a great wit who not only baffled the whole mystery of divination in a learned philosophical treatise but also published an extraordinary book concerning the nature of the gods which alone says mr harrington in his preliminaries to his oceana was sufficient to overthrow the religion of the roman state thus cicero contrived and effected himself the very crime for which he declaimed against cataline with so much vehemence and undermined the most solid foundations of the temples of the roman gods  about the same time the athenian philosophers began to establish themselves at rome the jews whose country pompey had subdued began every day to resort more and more to the worlds capitol the romans through an excess of ridiculous flattery deifyd their deceased emperors which alone was enough to make the roman religion ridiculous and jesus christ came into the world to introduce a new revelation what was the effect of all this upon the roman religion a superstition that had made such impressions on the minds of that people and from which they imagined that they and their ancestors had received so much benefit could not be utterly overthrown in a moment the romans were so very pertinacious in their principles and had so much phlegm and constancy in their constitutions that the grecian philosophy and the doctrine of cicero required some time to prevail however prevail they did and with them the christian religion got ground and the pagan declined and the superstition and poetry of the romans gradually declined together and the declension of the roman poetry was attributed even by petronius himself who was a thoroughpacd epicurean to the neglect of the old theology  per ambages deorumque ministeria precipitandus est liber spiritus chap xv objections answered conclusion of the former part of the work but here it concerns us to answer some objections which we easily foresee may be made for if the religion which the romans borrowed from the greeks had so great an influence on their poetry and the two treatises which cicero writ concerning divination and the nature of the gods gave such a shock to that superstition how comes it to pass that poetry not only flourished afterward but came to perfection in horace and virgil which two were the greatest of the roman poets in answer to which we shall endeavor to show as succinctly as we can why poetry flourished after the publication of those treatises and why it afterward came to perfection to satisfy the reader why poetry flourished afterward we need only repeat what we observed above that the phlegm and solidity of the roman people and perhaps their politics suspended the effect of those writings and of the doctrine of the grecian philosophers and when they began to spread it is reasonable to believe that they went downwards from the patricians and the roman knights to the people who in all probability were the last who were undeceived now the greatest of their poets and especially virgil and horace flourished within less than fifty years after the publication of those treaties and were most of them very meanly descended so that they were brought up in the religion of their country and had consequently when they came to write the advantage of first impressions and their copying the grecian poetry threw them upon the old ideas it is true some few of them were better descended and were roman knights but either they were too much men of pleasure to dive into philosophy or too much poets to espouse a sect that would not favor enthusiasm  but now let us enquire with the same brevity for what reason poetry that derives its preeminence from religion came to perfection among the romans after these attacks had been given to the religion of that state in answer to which we must put the reader in mind that there are three things which contribute to the perfection of poetry the first is nature which is the foundation and basis of all for nature is the same thing with genius and genius and passion are all one for passion in a poem is genius and the power of exciting passion is genius in a poet to the raising of which religion as we have shown above gives a very great advantage the second thing is art by which i mean those rules and that method which capacitate us to manage every thing with the utmost dexterity that may contribute to the raising of passion the third thing is the instrument by which the poet makes his imitation or the language in which he writes by language i do not mean here the expression of any particular poem or the poetical dialect which the poet models himself but the language of the country in which he writes and which he finds made to his hands these are the three things that contribute to the perfection of poetry so that in any age or country at whatever juncture religion and language and poetical art are in greatest force together at that very juncture the poetry of that country is at its height and this is the reason why tragedy which is a poem of the growth of attica was at its height in the time of sophocles because then the language was in perfection the art of poetry and particularly of tragedy had been extremely cultivated and religion as yet had power enough over the minds of men to enforce the passions but the greatest of these three is religion and the most prevalent toward the advancement of poetry as is plainly seen by the event for after that the introduction of moral philosophy had ruined the established religion among the grecians tragedy immediately lost its force tho the language remained in perfection afterward and the poetic art was perhaps improved let us now examine how the art of poetry and the roman language and the roman religion stood in the time of augustus the art of poetry which had been introduced by livius andronicus had now been cultivated for about two hundred years but with a great deal of interruption caused by the violences of those times and that it was at its utmost height in the time of augustus we have no great reason to doubt because we find more of the poetical art in the single aeneis of virgil than in all the rest of the roman poets together for the language that it was then at its height is agreed on by most and tho some few may contend that it was somewhat declined from the purity which it had in the preceding age yet it was certainly more poetical in the time of augustus that is more full more sounding more significant and more harmonious and as for religion we have already shown that the effect of the writings of cicero was suspended by the phlegmatic temper which was incapable of sudden impressions and perhaps by the politics of the romans but that was not all religion had then more force more authority and more majesty than it had had for some time before and that by the example of the emperor no one can be ignorant what influence the example of a prince has upon the minds of the people now augustus was in his temper religious even to superstition and tho during the violences of the triumvirate his politics had got the better of nature in him yet as soon as he had attained the sovereign power policy and nature were reconciled and both of them favored religion whereas the age preceding had been an age of continual violences and consequently not of so much religion the roman senate having got the lands from the people had consequently got the dominion so that that famous commonwealth was dwindled into an oligarchy and that oligarchy was grown factious as all oligarchies must of necessity do and the heads of those factions were all of them laboring who should overthrow the state so that they who were at the helm of the state neither were nor could appear good because there was a necessity of their giving pernicious examples augustus himself notwithstanding his natural clemency and his proneness to superstition was drawn in by ambition to the committing all manner of violences in the beginning of the triumvirate and neither did nor durst appear what he was till dividing the world between himself and anthony policy and nature were reconciled in him and he was obliged to appear rather more debonaire and religious than he was by his natural temper that the extravagancies of anthony appearing more hideous compared with the beauty of his character he might insensibly undermine his rival in the esteem of the senate and the roman people and alone command the universe and we may judge by this what influence the example of the emperor had upon the writers that it not only prevailed upon virgil to make piety one of the chief ingredients in the character of his hero who was designed by the poet the very picture of augustus caesar but engaged him to incorporate so much religion with the action of his poem that it is the most religious epick poem that ever was writ in the world  and thus we have endeavored to show as briefly as we could that art and language and religion were all of them in a great deal of force together in the glorious reign of augustus and much more powerfully united than ever they had been before and i hope i need not tell the reader than ever they were in the reigns of succeeding emperors and in showing that i have given the reasons why the roman poetry was then at its utmost height tho i make no doubt but that a settled calm and a full tranquillity after a fierce and a tedious tempest and the elevation that might spring from the remains and the appearances of liberty and consequently the appearances of their being masters of the universe and lastly the never to be forgotten bounty of a magnanimous prince and the emulation that must ensue upon it among so many extraordinary men might all of them contribute to the advancement of poetry  but if the writings that flourished aamong the romans and especially in the time of augustus received such advantage from the roman religion that the excellence and greatness of their poetry is chiefly owing to that how comes it that virgil is found in his writings to have had so exalted a notion of god as is utterly inconsistent with the grecian theology how comes it to pass that lucretius and horace are held to be thoroughpacd epicureans on whom the superstition that reigned among their countrymen could have no manner of influence and yet horace allowed to be after virgil the greatest of the roman poets and lucretius as tasso is pleased to call him a most noble versifyer  it is true indeed virgil had an exalted notion of god as we may see by several places in his works  ab jove principium musae jovis omnia plena and that famour passage in the fourth georgick  deum namque ire per omnes terrasque tractusque maris coelumque profundum and that in the sixth aeneid  principio coelum ac terras camposque liquentes lucentemque globum lunae titanniaque astra spiritus intus alit totosque infusa per artus mens agitat molem and magna se corpore miscet now this exalted notion of jupiter or the supreme being virgil had from the writings of plato and the rest of the gods and goddesses a little modifyed as they are in that poet in whom we we see none of homers religious extravagancies are exactly the platonic demons so that virgil strictly adhering to the platonic sect it follows that his philosophy did very little harm to his religion  but to proceed to horace he was so very far from being a thoroughpacd epicurean as some will obstinately have him that he was of every sect by turns and changed his philosophy and his religion with his humor as a great many do besides him and when that humor inclined him to libertinism then he was an epicurean and whenever it turned about to austerity then he became a stoic that there are a great many such persons in the world we may take the word of the duke de la rochefant  nous ne nous apercevons que des emportmens et des mouvmens extraordinares de nos humeurs et de notre temperament comme de la violence de la colere mais person quasi ne s apercoitque ces humeurs ont un course ordinaire et regle qui meant et turn doucement et imperceptiblement notre volonte a des actions differentes else roulent ensemble sil faut ainsi dire et exercent successivement un empire secret en nous memes de sorts quelles ont un part considerable en toutes nos actions sans que nous le puissions reconnoitre that is  we are sensible of nothing that passes within us but the extravagant extraordinary motions of our complexions and humors but hardly a man has made this discovery that those humors have a constant regular course which moves and insensibly inclines our wills to a great many different actions they run rolling together if i may use the expression and exercise a secret sway within us so that they have a considerable share in our actions while we are utterly unable to discern it now that horace was as likely to be biased by his humor as any other person whatsoever we have his own word epist   lib    si quaeret quid agam dic multa and pulchra minantem vivere nec recte nec suaviter haud quia grando contuderit vites oleamque momorderit aestus nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in arvis sed quia mente minus validus quam corpore toto nil audire velim nil discere quod level aegrum fidis offendar medicis irascar amicis cur me funesto properent arcere veterno quae nocuere sequar fugiam quae perfore credam romae tybur amem ventosus tibure romam so that as we observed above when this humor inclined him to libertinism then he was an epicurean and when the alteration of that humor inclined him to severity then he became a stoic or a platonic of which we have a notorious instance in the   th ode of the first book  parcus deorum cultor and infrequens etc it is true monsieur dacier treats this as raillery but it must be fine raillery that could never be found out to be raillery till above sixteen hundred years after it was writ horace has left enough behind him to show that he understood raillery a great deal better than that comes to but what will he say then to that remarkable passage of the first epistle of the first book  ac ne forte roges quo me duce quo lare tuter nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes nunc agilis fio and versor civilibus undis virtutis verae custos rigidusque satelles nunc in aristippi furtim praecepta relabor but tho we should grant that horace was always an epicurean yet that would make rather for than against us for it is certain that he was educated in the religion of his country as we observed above and we know that the force of first impressions is great and the copying the spirit of the grecian poetry threw him upon those first ideas  spiritum graiae tenuem cimenae parca non mendax dedit and then this very horace whom some of the moderns will so obstinately maintain to be a constant epicurean this very person who as he was the second of the roman poets was one of their greatest critics declares himself absolutely of our opinion viz that the roman poetry derived its preeminence from the roman religion for in his satyrs wherein he assures us he is no poet he intermingles none but burlesque religion and that very rarely with his verses in his odes where he knew that he was a poet religion is every where seen and invocations apostrophes machines and revelations abound in them  but now a word or two to lucretius he writ before the publication of ciceros treatises but then he was undeniably an epicurean and writ with a design to draw others over to his sect but in that very poem which he writ with a design to overthrow religion he shows of what importance religion was to poetry and the very treatise which he begins with a design to overturn the worship of the gods that very treatise he begins with the invocation of a goddess and that invocation is undeniably one of the noblest and most poetical parts of his book so that lucretius to attain an excellence in poetry was contented to be guilty of a very strange absurdity in philosophy for to what purpose does he invoke the goddess of love why he invokes her to inform him that he ought not to invoke her for that she does not hear him and does not regard him and has nothing at all to do with him  omnis enim divum per se natura a necesse est immortali aeuo summa cum pace fruatur semota a nostris rebus sejuntaque long for let no one tell me here that by venus the poet means only the generative faculty of things in short lucretius invokes something and invocation is adoration and whatever is adored must during the action by the adorer be esteemed a deity  but it is not only in his invocation that lucretius is pleased to have recourse to religion for after that in the two first books he has been taking a great deal of pains to destroy the belief of gods and providence that in his third he may be very poetical and very sublime he is forced to erect a new divinity in the room of those whom he has been just subverting and that is nature tho by what he makes her say in that noble prosopopaeia we might very well mistake her for providence  so that we have not only the opinion of lucretius on our side but the example too for by having recourse to religion in that very philosophy that utterly disclaims it he not only declares of what importance he thinks it to be to poetry but has shown of what importance it really is by succeeding so much better in those passages than in the other parts of his book but how could a materialist the reader may say draw any advantage from religion but lucretius was made not born a materialist he was bred in the religion of his country and so had the advantage of first impressions which are never to be defaced lucretius you may say perhaps was very lofty and very poetical where he had nothing to do with religion indeed sometimes he was so for i do not remember that i affirmed that there can be no poetry without religion but only that religion gives the occasion for the best the greatest and the most exalted and it makes for my purpose sufficiently that lucretius is most poetical and and sublime where he is religious but where he is lofty in other places we find him describing the great phenomenon of nature and the higher a man rises and the nearer he comes to the first infinite cause the nearer he certainly comes to religion besides where lucretius is lofty and poetical in describing the great phenomenon of of nature there we are sure to find him astonished for from whence comes his vehemence but from his astonishment which may give us a suspicion that lucretius was not so very assured of the truth of his opinion for effects astonish no man he who is astonished is moved by the secret causes of things which are two high or too deep for his comprehension so that in places where there is no mention of religion lucretius in some measure derives from that his impetuous golden torrent of verse his vehemence and his sublimity  and thus i have inquired into the merits of the ancients with all imaginable impartiality and have attempted to show that they had the advantage of the moderns in the greatness of poetry but that they derived it not from any superiority of faculties or any external or internal advantage abstracted from the nature of the subjects of which they treated but only from incorporating poetry with religion  the end of the first part the advancement and reformation of modern poetry part ii chap i that the design of the true religion and poetry are the same in the former part of this treatise we attempted to show that the ancient grecians and romans excelled the moderns in the greatness of poetry and so endeavored to oblige a very considerable party of mankind who admire the ancient poets to that degree that they despair of their being ever equaled much less surpassed by the moderns but then that we might disoblige as little as we could another body of men who have a high opinion of the moderns and are apt to think them upon an equal foot with the ancients we endeavored to prove that the ancients derived their preeminence not so much from any real superiority that they had in themselves as from the subjects of which they treated which subjects were sacred either in their own nature or by their manner of handling them so that we have taken the most effectual course that we could possibly do to remove the despair of  party without too much exalting them and to check the unreasonable presumption of the other without too much depressing them that so the one party might despond no more and the other be secure and careless no longer but tha the passions and prejudices being removed which have hitherto obstructed the advancement of a noble art and both parties being reconciled and united in the common opinion that the ancients tho they are exalted above us are not beyond our reach may immediately take fire and contending with a noble emulation push on the art to some degrees of perfection beyond what it has attained for these last fifteen hundred years for in the remaining part of this treatise we shall make it our business to convince the reader with all the brevity that the importance of the affair will admit of that the moderns by joining poetry with the true religion will have much the advantage of the ancients in the main tho they may fall short of them in some particular poems  but here it concerns us to answer an objection for perhaps the reader may say how can you maintain that the christian religion will be such a help to poetry when you have already in a former treatise made use of the authority of boileau to show that christianity and poetry were things that were inconsistent  de la foy dun chretien les mysteres terribles d ornemens egayez ne sont point susceptibles l evangele al espritn offer de tous cotez que penetence e fair ou tourmens meritez et de vos fictions le melange coupable meme a ses verites done lair de la fable that is  the terrible mysteries of the christian faith are not capable of delightful ornaments that the gospel offers nothing to our view but repentance on the one side and eternal torments on the other and that the criminal mixture of poetical fictions gave a fabulous air even to its most sacred truths to which we answer that we only made use of this passage in the forementioned treatise to show that the mysteries of the christian religion were not to be mixed with fiction and consequently that it would be a hard matter to contrive machines for an epick poem upon a modern christian subject and if boileau means any thing more by the forementioned passage i shall endeavor to show that he is mistaken and that there may not only be most exalted poetry upon a christian subject without machines and without fiction but that the true religion is more favorable to poetry than paganism or philosophy or deism and i shall first enquire into the reason of things and afterward see how it is supported by matter of fact  first i shall enquire into the reason of the thing and i make no doubt but to make it appear that the nearer poetry comes to perfection the more agreeable it is to the design of the true religion and that consequently poetry is much more noble and more instructive and more beneficial to mankind than either history or philosophy  in order to the doing which let us examine what the design is of the true religion and we shall find that not only the design of poetry is the very same but the very methods of attaining that design the same as far as they can be humanely prosecuted tho at the same time it must be confessed that poetry tho the noblest of all arts and preferable either to history or philosophy falls as short of the excellence of the true religion as human invention does of divine wisdom  the design of every religion must be the happiness of those who embrace it impostors and all who set up new religions for some politic ends must always pretend this or they will have no followers for all men propound happiness to themselves in every thing that they do and the reason why so few men are thoroughly and entirely of any religion is because they are not sufficiently convinced that it will make them happy but as even false religions must pretend to make those who profess them happy so the true one must really effect it for the true religion whether it is innate or revealed must certainly come from god and must be given by him as a rule and a law for those who embrace it to walk by now all laws that are made by good lawgivers are made for the happiness of those who embrace them but god must be good and consequently cannot make laws only because it is his arbitrary will no he must make them because he who best knows the nature of his own creatures knows that they will find their happiness in being conformable to them but if the design of all religion must be to make men happy why then that must be the true religion that makes men the most happy and consequently that must be the true religion that has the simplest design and the shortest and the surest for the design of the true religion being to make men happy it must necessarily be of such a nature as that all may be capable of it for if a religion of which none but men of sense were capable should be the true religion it would follow that god had made most men blockheads and afterward made them wretched for being so but now let us examine what religion that is that takes the shortest and the surest and most admirable method for making those who embrace it happy  since the design of all religion must be to make men happy and the only true religion can effect that design which all others in vain pretend to because only the true religion can come from god who alone understands our natures and alone knows that which the most will please us it follows that all who are not really of the true religion cannot be perfectly happy now this is certain that mankind has in all countries and in all ages in all places and at all times complained of the want of happiness both ancients and moderns philosophers and the people have agreed that man was miserable and this universal consent may be sufficient to show that the misery of man is real and not imaginary besides they have all both ancients and moderns philosophers and poets men of sense and the vulgar admirably agreed in describing it they have all consented in this that the misery of man proceeded from a perpetual conflict that is within him and from a discord continually reigning among the faculties of the soul a cruel war between the passion and senses and the reason while the reason violently draws one way and the passions and the senses another the latter endeavoring still to be pleased by getting the upper hand of the former and the former contending to be satisfied by subduing the latter while neither party can gain an entire victory but an eternal conflict remains for tho the frequent advantages are on the side of the passions yet reason rallies from time to time and maintains a running fight  video meliora proboque deteriora sequor says medea in ovid and says horace  th epistle of the first book  dic multa and pulchra minantem vivere nec recte nec suaviter haud quia grando contuderit vites oleamque momorderit aestus nec quia longisquis armentum aegrotet in arvis sed quia mente minus validus quam corpore toto nil audire velim nil discere quod levet aegrum fidis offendar medicis irascar amicis cur me funesto properent arcere veterno quae nocuere sequar fugiam quae perfore credem but st paul who knew the cause of this misery of mankind has given by much the most clear and lively description of it romans chapter   ver                     and bringing into captivity the law of sin which is in my members      thus has st paul given a lively description of the conflict that is in the human soul between passion and reason because he very well knew the cause of it the philosophers felt the effect and could describe it tolerably well but being wholly ignorant of the cause they took that to be a defect in nature which is really an infectious distemper and here lay the folly of those people in believing that they were capable of altering nature which puts me in mind of an astrological king of naples who not being very well pleased with what he thought the system and contrivance of the universe said that if god when he made the world would have vouchsafed to have consulted him he could have given him very good advice for so by their writings the philosophers seem to have been of opinion that whereas god had made man impious they could make him good and whereas he had made him a blockhead they could make him wise  but the philosophers not knowing the cause of the misery of man made very successless attempts toward the making us happy for whether they supported the reason against the passions all that they gained was to inflame the contention which they designed to extinguish and by rousing and exasperating the parties make that war be carried on with vehemence which perhaps was in a languishing state before or whither they animated the passions against the reason they could only mortify what they could never vanquish  thus whither they endeavored to live up to the dictates of reason the passions plagued them by a very violent resistance or whether they endeavored to plunge themselves in sensual pleasure they could no further oppress the reason than they stupefied the whole man and remorse at last like the dragon that watched the hesperian fruit was never to be laid asleep  but tho the philosophers seemed wholly in the dark the poets appeared to have a glimmering of the truth as we may conclude from the fable of pandora and epimetheus whether they had it from old tradition or from a noble effort of reason for says mr mede if there were no scripture yet the unsampled irregularity of our whole nature which all the time of our life runs counter to all order and right reason the woeful misery of our condition being a scene of sorrow without any rest or contentment this might breed some general suspicion that ab initio non fuit ita but that he who made us lords of his creatures made us not so worthless and vile as now we are but that some common father to us all had drank some strange and devilish poison wherewith the whole race was infected thus far goes mr mede and i will make bold to add by the leave of the clergy that this suspicion might very well grow up to reason and certainty though there were no scripture for that man is miserable experience assures us but since man is a creature capable of happiness and one who knows his misery reason may tell us that man could never be created miserable for that would have been contrary to the goodness of god which is his darling attribute since god might as well damn his creatures for nothing as he might create them miserable man therefore was certainly created happy and happy had he continued till now if it had not been for his own fault because it had been repugnant to the justice of god to punish man for nothing thus far we may conclude then by the force of reason that man has committed some horrible crime the which has made him miserable  but though the strength of reason may reach thus far yet it could never inform man of the nature of the crime the committing of which has made him miserable nor in what his original happiness consisted all that that we can guess by reason is this that since the misery of man at present lies in the conflict that he has within himself and in the civil war which is maintaind in his faculties that his original happiness consisted in the peace and agreement and the harmony that was between them and that the crime that caused his unhappiness was in all likelihood something that naturally and necessarily broke that harmony and that agreement and that we may see how far these conjectures agree with what our religion says of it let us make some enquiry into the account which sacred writ has given of it  that tells us that man was not in the beginning what he is at present that he was created holy innocent perfect that his creator filled him with the brightness of knowledge and with a luminous lively intelligence that he then had a strict dependence on his maker that he communicated the wonders of his glory to him that the eye of man then saw the majesty of god and that this creature so miserable now was then most entirely happy that he was unclouded untroubled impained impassive immortal this is the account that our religion gives us of the primitive state of man it tells us how great his knowledge was his happiness and his perfection let us now see how much his passions and his senses were able to contribute to so much felicity  that man in his original state had passions and great passions is certain for without passion there can be no happiness because there can be no pleasure besides it must be by a great passion or by great passions that the first man must fall for by the weakness of his reason he could not be lost for if he had not had reason enough to know that he ought not to have committed the transgression which ruined him why then the ruin of man had not been his own fault man therefore before the fall had passions but being in a state of perfect felicity he could consequently be subject to no passions which were not entirely consistent with that he walked with god and was then united to him because the creator was pleased to communicate himself in so great a degree to his creature man therefore constantly contemplated god not so much by the force of reason as of intuition or a luminous lively intelligence god acted upon his mind and he felt him as well as saw him and consequently admired loved desired adored him and the result of these charming passions was a joy unspeakable for the more they were exalted the more his reason approved of them and since it knew that he could never suffer by them in that state of happiness and of immortality it eternally exhorted him to perpetuate them and told him that they could never be too high for their glorious object so that man in his primitive state was always in lofty ravishing transports for love admiration joy and desire those charming passions were all that he knew of which blissful love was always the chief for god making man a sociable creature gave him such a sort of a happiness as that the felicity of one might produce that of another and what could that be but an habitual charity or loving god and man for the sake of god our blissful sire enjoyed a sincere felicity and consequently could never know any trouble nor any passion that had a mixture of trouble as anger sorrow fear and the like much less could ambition find room in his breast with envy hatred pride and revenge and the rest of those turbulent passions that are utterly inconsistent with charity  and as his passions were always pleasing so his senses were never shocked the happy creature converst with angels and saw the majesty of his maker and for the terrestrial objects which were around him and which were all subjected to his universal empire whenever he surveyed them like his creator he found that they were always good and as the creatures never were disobedient he was never displeased with them for as he had neither fear nor knowledge of suffering antipathy aversion horror and the like were things that he never knew which in this woeful state of misery are so often natures secret intelligencers to advise us of approaching harm thus all the faculties were always pleased and man was blessed unspeakably  but the result of this perfect harmony was not only continual happiness but unclouded knowledge and immortality for as from the agreement of the vital faculties and their concording motions spirit and health and pleasant ease and vigor of sense proceeds so from the harmony of the rational and animal powers proceeded a luminous lively intelligence and a blissful immortality for pleasure was the result of that agreement and since death can only come by pain he who is in a state of perpetual pleasure must by consequence be immortal  but man alas was unable to support so much happiness without presumption he formed the design of growing independent of shaking off the government of him who made him and finding his felicity apart from god this made him conceive the horrible crime of diverting his affections from him who alone was worthy of them to things that were formed so many degrees inferior to him and that which made the unpardonable enormity of that crime was this that when god had created him with an ardent desire of happiness and had created him of such a nature that his full and his perfect happiness lay in his strict dependence on him and had given him a clear understanding to know this that i say made the unpardonable enormity of his crime that contrary to this nature and this desire and this unclouded knowledge he revolted and fell off from god and by the suggestion of his greatest enemy taxed him at once with folly and envy in believing himself capable of finding and enjoying a greater felicity than what his maker designed for him and thus mans fatal original sin whether the business of the tree of knowledge is literal or allegorical consisted in his horribly diverting his affections from his god to the creatures and thus the harmony of his intellectual and animal powers was very miserably broke for reason disapproved of the unworthy objects that man had chosen for his passions and the passions being natural and congenial to the soul could not be idle and man could not reduce them to their primitive object for god had abandoned him to himself and how should man of himself approach infinity  and now the blissful time was no more when man was only touched with transporting passions and now the force of those charming passions was continually curbed by reason which utterly disapproved of their objects and a thousand vexatious ones sprung up among them like cockle to choke the vital seed and which were partly the result of present misery and partly of past felicity  besides the senses partook of the same disorder that had seized the passions and they that during his state of innocence were always pleased with the approbation of reason and were never disturbed now either betrayed him to concupiscence or were shocked at their several objects his eye and his ear those noble ministers of the understanding were no longer charmed with the voice of god and the glorious presence of angels and were either too much engaged by the terrestrial objects around them or disturbed in despite of reason the creatures whom god had furnished with instinct sufficient for the care of their preservation in their degenerate monarch beheld their enemy they gladly obeyed him during his innocence as loyal subjects do a good king but when he grew wicked he grew a tyrant and they at the same time turned rebels from hence aversions horrors antipathies and fear and hate and rage sprung up in them and man was got into a state of war with all the inferior creatures who of his humble vassals before were now his potent enemies both parties were on their guard incessantly always dreaded and always terrified  and thus the harmony of the intellectual and animal powers was dissolved by original sin and the ignorance of this caused all the blunders of the philosophers they knew very well that the combat between the reason and passions caused the misery of man but they never dreamt of reconciling the difference because alas they never thought that the parties had once been friends all that they aimed at was to put an end to the conflict by destroying one of the parties and so some of them thought of stifling the reason and others of suppressing the passions  but the folly of these two designs was equally great because they are attempts at things that are equally impossible for as long as man is man he must have reason and as long as there is reason there will be remorse which will rally from time to time and be a check upon the exorbitance of the passions and tho remorse could be entirely extinguished as i believe it never can yet reason would be sure to make its declaration another way and that is by our inconstancy in pleasure and our want of variety  nor is the folly less of endeavoring to suppress the passions for either they must be wholly suppressed or restrained but all the passions being natural in the condition in which man is now none of them can be wholly suppressed without destroying the man nor can some of them be so much as moderated without maintaining constantly in the soul a very violent conflict because they were perfectly unrestrained in their original natures  the passions are either natural and congeneal to the soul or accidental these first are those which are pleasing to it as love joy desire and with these the first man was created for man was created happy but without these passions there can be no happiness the accidental passions as anger envy indignation and desire of revenge are those with which man at the first was not created for they all include misery and he was created happy they were all the result of the fall which brought woe to the race of men man is indeed capable of restraining these last because they all of them include misery and he retaining a vehement desire of happiness tho joined to an impotence of attaining it is by that very desire capacitated to struggle with apparent misery but it must needs be a hard contention when we pretend to moderate the first because there is something within us that secretly tells us they are necessary to our happiness and the conflict must needs be violent when we strive against our own happiness besides they are as natural to the soul as reasoning and the result of that and a reasonable creature can no more be without admiration love and desire than it can be without thinking or without the appetites of sense and a man can no more suppress the one by philosophy than the other he can no more take away love and desire by reasoning than he can satisfy hunger and thirst with a syllogism all that he can arrive at is either to conceal those passions as he may do his appetites or to refuse to act in consequence of them as he may in consequence of thinking or of sensual appetites or lastly he may weaken these congeneal passions by mortification as he may do his appetites or his reason for a distemper weakens the whole man and mortification is a distemper in effect at least but when the man is in health and his senses vigorous and his reason piercing these appetites too will be strong and the more powerful the reason is the stronger will be the passions and therefore the attempt to suppress these was folly in the philosophers for these passions are the pleasure of the soul which cannot struggle with success against felicity the cause of their mistake was this some of them as for example the stoics thought that reason disapproved of the passions when she only disliked the objects whereas the cyrenaicks on the other hand thought that humane nature allowed of the objects when it did nothing but approve of the passions  and this may serve to show the folly of deism as well as it may of philosophy for deism pretending like philosophy to combat all the passions must be founded on the strength of reason but a religion founded on the strength of reason cannot be the true religion for the true religion must be sent from god for the happiness of mankind and of that religion all must be capable as we have shown above but of a religion founded on the strength of reason and whose proofs must of consequence be deduced from a long train of consequences all men are not capable for every religion must have proofs and all men are not capable of the proofs of such a religion as that as for example before a man can be a deist effectually he must be convinced of the being of a god by reason and must be convinced by the same reason that the world is governed by god but to be capable of the proofs that deism gives of those two points a man must either have a very strong reason or a very good education whereas not so much as one in forty of mankind has either but all are capable of the proofs of revealed religion for by proving the divinity of the revelation the doctrine is proved in course now the divinity of the revelation must be proved by miracles but miracles are proofs of which all men are capable because they speak to the passions and appeal to the senses since therefore the true religion must be designed for all and all men are capable of the proofs of revealed religion whereas not one in forty is capable of the proofs of deism it follows that a religion that is not revealed cannot be the true religion  besides no religion can be the true religion that is insufficient to answer the ends of government but a religion that is not designed for all can never answer the ends of government and therefore deism cannot be the true religion for there are but two things that can restrain mankind and keep them within the power of law religion and sense enough to know their real interest but we have already made it appear above that whoever wants good sense cannot be restrained by deism  that deism is insufficient to answer the ends of government may be further plain from matter of fact for it would be an easy thing to convince the reader that there never was any tolerable government in the world without a revealed religion and that the governments that have been most renowned upon earth flourished with their respective revelations and with them decayed as the israelites did with their prophets the grecians with their oracles and the romans with their divinations so that either the true religion can be in the world without order and without peace or deism cannot possibly be the true religion  again either that can be the true religion which can contribute nothing even to the happiness of those who embrace it or deism cannot be the true religion for deism contributes nothing at all to the happiness even of those who are capable of it because that by combating and resisting the passions it maintains the war of the faculties instead of appeasing it  thus we have shown that the design of the true religion must not only be to make men happy but must effectually do it that the philosophers indeed had that design but blunderd in the execution of it and by pretending either to set up our passions above our reason or our reason above our passions only maintained an eternal conflict in the breasts they designed to ease that the deist does the very same thing by his endeavors to exalt reason by depressing the passions let us now show how the christian religion exalts our reason by exalting the passions and by a plain and a short but a most admirable design restores the harmony of the human faculties and the felicity of the first man  for after that christianity has gained its professors by proving after the most plain and simple manner all that is necessary to be believed in it that is by miracles attested by unexceptionable witnesses it gains its end which is the happiness of its believers in so plain so sure and so short a way that the way to happiness and the end is but one and the same thing and differs only in degree set your affections on things above and not on things below says the apostle coloss     that is do but earnestly desire of god to incline your affections to him their primitive object do but desire it and he will incline them and the great business of religion is done the harmony of the human faculties restored and the felicity of the first man in some measure at least renewed nay the way is shorter and plainer even than this for do but earnestly desire of god to give you charity and he will give it and with that give every virtue for to show how plain how short how admirable the design is of this divine religion love which is but a single passion and the most pleasing of all the passions comprehends all its duties and all its felicity st paul has given an admirable reason why it comprehends all its duties for love says he works no ill to his neighbor and is therefore the fulfilling of the law and that it is inclusive of all its felicity may be concluded from hence that charity gently restraining those tumultuous passions which disturb and torment the mind exalts all the pleasing affections which are natural and congeneal to the soul and exalts the very reason of mankind by exalting those charming passions for reason being troubled no more in its functions by the painful conflict which it maintained before is free to discern and distinguish divine truth and now employs the exten and stretch of its power in confirming and augmenting the force of those aspiring passions which while they were directed to mortal objects it esteemed its mortal enemies and as the reason rouzes and excites the passions the passions as it were in a fiery vehicle transport the reason above mortality which mounting soars to the heaven of heavens upon the wings of those very affections that before repressed the noble efforts that it made to ascend the skies  and thus we have seen how the christian religion reconciles passion to reason and while the troublesome virtues of deists and old philosophers are employed in restraining those charming passions which are so natural to the soul of man and which rightly directed constitute all its felicity the cardinal virtues of the true religion as faith and hope and charity are exalted passions themselves and as christianity confirms and cherishes all the pleasing affections which are to the soul as so many delicious friends and so many dear relations the very conversation of which is sufficient to make it happy it gently appeases the tumultuous passions accidental uneasy guests that interrupt its pleasure  but the christian religion restores the harmony of the human powers to a greater degree than this and provides even a pleasure of sense that may be highly approved of by reason for though the christian in this life is not allowed to expect that in a sovereign degree yet since there is no sight so charming to the eye and no music so harmonious to the ear as the voice and looks of those whom we love the christian religion by commanding us   epist of st pet chapter   v   to love one another with a pure heart fervently has provided in an admirable manner for the delight of those noble senses  thus the proofs ofchristianity are short and plain and its doctrine that leads to felicity admirably short and unperplexd whereas the proofs of deism are abstruse i mean to the people they are abstruse and we have shown that the true religion must be designed for all and the method that it takes to make us happy tedious and vexatious and this is extremely remarkable that the very morality which in deism and in philosophy is proved at the first perhaps with difficulty and perhaps at the last obscurely and when it is proved obeyed with pain because it shocks all the pleasing passions which so firmly inhere to the soul that very morality in the christian religion is clearly and easily proved to all because the divinity of its revelation is clearly and easily proved and when it is proved is pursued with pleasure because it is every part of it dictated by love the best and sweetest of all the passions  and thus christianity performs in a moment what philosophy and deism have for ages in vain attempted for god can touch the heart in a moment and a short contrition makes way for a long felicity and the wisdom of god seems loudly to declare the simplicity of his great design by the persons whom he chose to execute it for had there been any thing perplexed or difficult in it men of choice education and great parts would have been chosen to expound it but it was so easy so clear so agreeable to the nature of man whether considered as an individual or a member of a vast society for charity that makes the happiness of particulars tends to the felicity of the whole community and whereas justice is satisfied with the restraining men from the doing harm charity the most active and the best natured of all virtues engages him to the doing good and there can be no such prevalent motive for the making any one happy as because we love him the design i say of this holy religion is so agreeable to the nature of man that god made choice of twelve poor fishermen or something more vile to human regard than fishermen to propagate its divine doctrine and to whom did they preach it not to brutal savages as orpheus did his pretended revelation before them nor to bloody barbarians as mahomet did his fanatic enthusiasm afterward but to the most civilized and knowing nations of the world when learning was at the greatest height amongst them to the provinces of the lesser asia who were the most subtle people on the earth to greece the great inventress of arts and to rome the mistress of nations to rome that with her victorious armies had even then just then subdued and civilized the barbarous world and twelve poor ignorant contemptible fishermen who were dispisd by their own nation and whose nation it self was almost universally despicable in a very short time established this doctrine in the midst of these knowing nations nay and established it without arts without eloquence without reputation without power and downright innocence and simplicity prevailed over the subtilty of the asiaticks the vigorous lively penetration of the greeks and the profound solidity of the romans so that knowledge blushing was instructed by ignorance and the vain efforts of all human wisdom stood confounded by the foolishness of preaching and the apostle had a great deal of reason to exeult in the first ep to the cor v  0    where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world has not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that by the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe and v the   th ibid god has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wisdom of the wise so that this religion propagated under these strange disadvantages by ignorance against philosophy by simplicity against arts and eloquence by weakness against all the opposition of power by abject and contemptible persons against the noise and renown of wisdom by men under poverty and persecution against all the flatteries of imperial tyrants this divine religion embraced with danger boasted of in sufferings and taught in martyrdom this religion i say thus wonderfully propagated must needs have had something in the design of it when it was but never so little attended to that is extremely agreeable to the nature of man and must be better adapted to make a creature compounded of passions and reason happy than either power or place or worldly prosperity or fame or philosophy were before but what could be so agreeable to the nature of a creature compounded of the foresaid faculties as that which reconciled those faculties which neither fame nor philosophy riches nor power could ever be found to do or how could twelve poor wretched fishermen without education without parts comprehend what the worlds great sages could never find out or how could they consent against apparent interest in making it known to the world if they had not been instructed and compelled to act by something that was more than human  and thus we have shown how that the design of all religion must be to make men happy but that the true religion must not only design it but must effectually do it and then we proceeded to show that the misery of man consisting in the conflict which is maintained within him his happiness by consequence must proceed from the harmony which is in the human faculties then we showed how that harmony came to be broke and how it was afterward by the christian religion restored  but now as the end of every religion must be the happiness of those who embrace it so the design of every art must be the very same as has been always acknowledged by all who have enquired into the nature of art in general or into the designs of particular arts and as the true religion must not only propound the happiness of its professors but must really effect it and as that alone is the true religion which makes the best provision for the happiness of those who profess it so that must be the best and the noblest art which brings the greatest felicity with it but as the misery of man proceeds from the discord and those civil jars that are maintained within him it follows that nothing can make him happy but what can remove that discord and restore the harmony of the human faculties so that that must be the best and the noblest art which makes the best provision at the same time for the satisfaction of all the faculties the reason the passions the senses but none of them provides in such a sovereign manner as poetry for the satisfaction of the whole man together in some of them only reason finds its account as in logic and mathematics in some of them only reason and passion as in the ancient eloquence and that by no means in a sovereign degree for sometimes the passions oppress the reason and sometimes reason excludes the passions in others the passions and the senses are charmed while reason finds little contentment in them thus music by its harmony raises the passions at the same time that it pleases the ear and painting by its touches moves the affections at the same time that it charms the eye but in a sublime and accomplished poem the reason and passions and senses are pleased at the same time superlatively the reason in the soundness and importance of the moral and the greatness and justness of an harmonious design whose parts so beautiful when they are considered separately become transporting upon a view or the whole while we are never weary of contemplating their exact proportion and beautiful symetry and their secret wonderful dependence while they are all animated by the same spirit in order to the same end the reason further finds its account in the exact perpetual of servance of decorums and in beholding itself exalted by the exaltation of the passions and in seeing those passions in their fiercest transports confined to those bounds which that has severely prescribed them that the passions must find their account in poetry we have endeavored to prove in the former part of this treatise but we cannot forbear taking notice of this that those very passions which plague and torment us in life please us nay transport us in poetry that the noble senses find their account in an accomplished poem no one who has read one can a moment doubt nor corellis hand nor syphaces voice could ever to a judicious ear equal the virgilian harmony which has all the mastery with all the air and all the sweetness with all the force that the most delicate ear can require tho all his numbers are always perfect yet he never dwells upon any and they which are in themselves so pleasing delight us the more because we are immediately forced to leave them for the perfection of some different harmony nor is the eye less satisfied than the ear for an admirable poet always paints and all his pictures are always beautiful let the real objects be never so odious let them be never so dreadful yet he is sure to paint them delightful for tho sometimes a vigorous lively imitation of creatures that are in their natures noxious may be capable of giving us terror yet nature by giving us a secret intelligence that the object is not real can turn even that tormenting passion to pleasure  thus poetry by restoring the harmony of the human faculties provides for the happiness of mankind better than any other human invention whatever and it is for this reason that it has always been so highly esteemed by the greatest of men they who have arrived at the being masters of the universe have afterward entertained the ambition of becoming poets and after they have acquired a great deal of fame by making whole nations miserable have aspired to the more charming glory of making mankind happy it is for this very reason that this delicious art has had as many confessors if i may be allowed to call them so almost as religion it self it is for this very reason that so many have been willing to renounce all worldly greatness for it and pleasure which attends on power and have been contented to live poor and miserable pitied by the wise and contemned by fools persecuted by fortune and hated by one another  for no man leaves pleasure but for greater pleasure and he who forsakes all the world for poetry must find a happiness in that which all the world could not supply him with poetry seems to be a noble attempt of nature by which it endeavors to exalt it self to its happy primitive state and he who is entertained with an accomplished poem is for a time at least restored to paradise that happy man converses boldly with immortal beings transported he beholds the gods ascending and descending and every passion in its turn is charmed while that his reason is supreamly satisfied perpetual harmony attends his ear his eye perpetual pleasure ten thousand different objects he surveys and the most dreadful please him tigers and lions he beholds like the first man with joy because like him he sees them without danger but nothing that is merely human can be on all sides perfect the delight which poetry gives is neither perpetual nor are all men capable of it religion alone can provide man a pleasure that is lasting as it may be universal poetical fire neither always burns in us nor can it always warm us but charity like the sacred flame that was the guardian of the roman empire if it is with care maintained like that becomes like that eternal  but now since the design of poetry and the very method of prosecuting that design as far as it can be humanly prosecuted is the same with that of the true religion since the very thing that they both propose is to exalt the reason by exalting the passions and so make happy the whole man by making internal discord cease i appeal to any one whether poetry must not agree better with that religion whose designs are the very same with it than with paganism or philosophy or deism whose designs have been shown repugnant to it in short when the pagan theology was brought nearer to the christian religion by the philosophy of plato as it was modelled by virgil it became the fitter for poetry for virgil saw with an admirable judgment not only that the reason must find its account in poetry as well as the passions and the senses but that the reason of mankind in the time of augustus caesar when moral philosophy got ground every day in the world would not be satisfied at so easy a rate as it was when homer writ or at least that it would not long be satisfied at so easy a rate which obliged him to model the grecian revelation by the philosophy of plato and that got virgil the preeminence over homer for since the design of every art is to make men happy and that is the best and the noblest art which makes the best provision for the happiness of mankind and nothing can make man so happy as the reconciling him to himself which can be no way so effectually done as by making all the faculties find their satisfaction together it follows that that must be the noblest poetry where the reason the passions and senses are all of them pleased and pleased in the highest degree together and therefore tho we should be obliged to grant what some will pretend with so much obstinacy and which i can never believe that the passions and the senses find their account in homer better than they do in virgil yet since they find their account too in virgil in a very great degree and reason at the same time is satisfied whereas it is horribly shocked in homer by the extravagance of his theology it follows that virgil for that reason is certainly to be preferred to homer tho this is to be said in the behalf of the latter that he writ to the people of his own age in which the reason of mankind was satisfied at an easier rate  and therefore when i say that virgil is to be preferred to homer i mean that he is so in regard to us because he is capable of giving us a greater pleasure than homer but i do not pretend at the same time that virgil is capable of giving us a greater pleasure than homer gave his contemporaries as likewise when i affirm that the moderns by joining poetry with the true religion will have the advantage of the ancients i mean only in regard to us to whom they will give a greater pleasure than the ancients can do but not a greater than the ancients gave their contemporaries in short if virgil was forced to model his grecian revelation by platonism that he might please more effectually even in his time when that revelation as yet prevailed i think we may very well conclude that in our time we ought to fling it out of our poetry when it has been for so long time utterly exploded and contemned by the very boys thus the grecian religion and the modern poetry can agree but very indifferently because the reason is shocked by it and if reason is shocked by the religion which is joined with the poetry by the religion i say which gives the force to the passions as we have shown above i would fain know how the passions can very well find their account i know indeed very well that a poet by the force of a strong imagination may enter into the grecian religion when he sets himself to write and transport himself to the age and scene of his action and consequently may draw a great deal of advantage from the religion of that country and of that age in order to the being moved and if the poet is extremely moved himself why they who read him must be moved in some measure too but whether the generality of readers can be so very much moved as if the passions derived their force from a religion that is more familiar to them i have a great deal of reason to doubt but if reason cannot find its account in the grecian religion joined with the modern poetry much less would the passions find their satisfaction in deism or the ancient philosophy the christian religion alone can supply a poet with all that is sublime and majestic in reason all that is either soft or powerful either engaging or imperious in the passions and with all the objects that are most admirable to the senses and consequently most delightful as shall be shown at large in the following chapter  chap ii we showed in the former part of this treatise that the ancients excelled the moderns in the greatness of poetry because they incorporated poetry with religion and we pretended to show in this second part that by joining poetry with the true religion the moderns in the main will have the advantage of the ancients in order to the proving which we showed in the first chapter that the design of the christian religion was agreeable to that of poetry whereas the designs of paganism and deism and philosophy were not agreeable to it we showed that the true design of poetry as well as of the christian religion was to please the reason the passions and the senses at the same time for we showed in the former part of this treatise that passion whether ordinary or enthusiastic is the principal thing in poetry and nothing is more certain than that the more the senses are stirred and the more the reason at the same time is satisfied the more strongly for the most part the passions of reasonable creatures are moved  now in this chapter we pretend to show that the true divine poetry has the advantage of the pagan poetry that it satisfies the reason more at the same time that it raises a stronger passion and that it entertains the senses and especially the eye more delightfully and we pretend to give undeniable instances of it both from sacred writ and from one of the fathers and from one of our own poets  there is certainly to subject so great as the power of god and both homer and virgil have handled it to admiration the latter says of jupiter who presided at the council of the gods in the tenth book  tum pater omnipotens rerum cui prima potestas infit eo dicente deum domus alta silescit et tremefacta solo tellus silet arduus ether tum zephyri posuere premit placida aequora pontus and thus mr dryden has made it english  then thus to both replied the imperial god who shakes heavens axels with his awful nod when he begins the silent senate stand with reverence listening to the dread command the clouds dispell the winds their breath restrain and the hushed waves lie flatted on the main but virgil has handled this subject still after a greater manner in the first of the georgicks and that the reader may have all the force of it set before his eyes we shall show him how it is prepared and begin a little before it  saepe ego cum flavis messorem induceret arvis agricola and fragili jam stringeret hordea culmo omnia ventorum concurrere praelia vidi quae gravidam late segetem ab radicibus imis saepe etiam immensum coelo venit agmen aquarum et faedam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris collectae ex alto nubes ruit arduus ether et pluvia ingenti sata laeta boumque labores diluit implentur fossae and cava flumina creseunt cum sonitu fervetque fretis spirantibus aequor ipse pater media nimborum in nocte corusca fulmina molitur dextra quo maxima motu terra tremit fugere ferae and mortalia corda per genteis humilis stravit pavor ille flagranti aut atho aut rhodopen aut alta ceraunia telo dejicit ingeminant austri and densissimus imber nunc memora ingenti vento nunc litora plangunt and mr dryden has made it english after so noble a manner that he has done all the justice that our language would allow him to the admirable original  often have i seen a sudden storm arise the heavy harvest from the root is torn and whirled aloft the lighter stubble born with such a force the flying rack is driven and such a winter wears the face of heaven and often whole sheets descend of sluicy rain sucked by the spungyclouds from off the main the lofty skies at once come powring down the promised crop and golden labors drown the dykes are filled and with a roaring sound the rising rivers float the nether ground and rocks the bellowing voice of boiling seas rebound the father of the gods his glory shrowds involved in tempests and a night of clouds and from the middle darkness flashing out by fits he deals his fiery bolts about earth feels the motions of her angry god her entrails tremble and her mountains nod and flying beasts in forests seek abode deep horror seizes every human breast their pride is humbled and their fear confessed while he from high his rolling thunder throws and fires the mountains with repeated blows the rocks are from their old foundations rent thewinds redouble and the rains augment the waves on heaps are dashed against the shore and now the woods and now the billows roar but now let us see how the psalmist has treated the same subject in the eighteenth psalm and we shall find that the greatness of virgil is littleness compared to his                      now in the first place reason finds its account better here than it does in virgil for the more amazing effects that we see of divine displeasure the more it answers our idea of infinite wrath but there is nothing that virgil has said upon this subject but what is much stronger in the psalmist and there are several things in the latter which are by no means in virgil for example how much stronger is the hills also moved and were shaken because he was wroth than that of virgil  ille flagranti aut atho aut rhodopen aut alta ceraunia telo dejicit which only signifies the thunders rending the tops of the mountains which any one may see is weak in comparison of what david says that the very mountains seemed to have a sense of the indignation of their creator mr dryden endeavored to add strength to this passage of virgil  earth feels the motions of its angry god her entrails tremble and her mountains nod but he too falls very much short of the force of the psalmist for he makes the trembling of the earth and the nodding of the mountains to be only the natural necessary effects of mechanical motion  and that which satisfies the reason the more here raises the passion more strongly and entertains the senses the better because there are more and more amazing effects of the divine pleasure for how great how lofty how terrible is that he bowed the heavens and came down and darkness was under his feet how much stronger than that of virgil ipse pater etc and how poetical and how dreadful is that then the channels of the waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils how terribly is the eye delighted here which is a sense that the poet ought chiefly to entertain because it contributes more than any other to the exciting of strong passion and here i desire the reader to consider that there is more terror here both ordinary and enthusiastic and consequently more spirit in a faint copy nay a prosaick copy translated in the imperfection of our tongue and by men who in all likelihood had no manner of notion of poetry than there is in virgils original what force and what infinite spirit must there not have been in the original hebrew since these are thoughts that are so truly great and so truly lofty that they carry with them spirit and force and fire through whatever head they pass and whatever language how admirable and inimitable must they not have been in the hands of that divine poet who knew how to show them to the utmost advantage the character of buchanan is by no means elevation but yet he is so exalted in this description that he soars above virgil who is by nature lofty  ille super solio residens flammantis olympi audiit orantem postquam pervenit in altum clamor and attentas advertit questibus aures protinus e vultu domini conterrita tellus intremuit montesque caua compage soluti nutarunt penitusque imis fremuere cavernis fumeus afflatu de naribus aestus anhelo undabat rapidae contorto vertice flammae ore sluunt vivaque animant attacta fovilla utque suum dominum terrae demittat in orbem leniter inclinat justum fastigia coelum succedunt pedibus fuscae caliginis umbrae ille vehens curru volucri cui flammeus ales lora tenens levibus ventorum ad remigat alis se circum furvo nebularum involuit amictu praetenditque cavas piceis in nubibus und acribus ex oculis vibratae spicula flamm discutiunt tristes claro fulgore tenebras inde ruit crepitans lapidosae grandinis imber discursantque vagae sinnosa volumina flammae at vero ut sancto sermon silentia rupit protinus horrifico tonitru coelum omne remugit grandinis and crebra tellus crepitante procella pulsa sonat ruptisque micant e nubibus ignes flamiferaeque volant magnum per inane sagittae fulguraque ingeminant laticum concussa lacunas pandit hians tellus and fontibus ora relaxat succutiturque paueus and fundamenta revelat et rescrat chaos aeterni sic vox tonat oris sic formidandae grave spiritus infremit irae now how much stronger and more poetical is  protinus e vultu domini conterita tellus intremuit than that of virgil quo maxima motu terra tremit   and how much weaker is  ille flagranti aut atho aut rhodopen aut alta ceraunia telo dejicit earth feels the motions of her angry god her entrails tremble and her mountains nod how much weaker is this i say than  montesque cava compage soluti nutarunt penitusque imis fremuere cavernis where buchanan shows the mountains not only disjoynted with the terrible fright and shaken from their very foundations but every one of them roaring with infernal thunder like mongivell or vesuvius besides that in this passage of the psalmist every thing is great and every thing is sustained whereas in that of the first georgick even the great virgil forgets himself  quo maxima motu terra tremit fugere ferae earth feels the motions of her angry god her entrails tremble and her mountains nod and flying beasts in forests seek abode how poorly does the last verse of the triplet answer to the greatness of the other two  but now if any one pretends here that virgil is describing only a common storm whereas david is describing the extraordinary indignation of god to him i answer that virgil to heighten that common storm shows it to be the effect of divine wrath and divine wrath must at all times be infinite but to show the invalidity of such an objection i desire any one to produce any thing from the grecian and roman poets upon the same subject that is any ways comparable to this passage of the psalmist for as our religion gives us more exalted notions of the power of an infinite being than the heathen religion did to the grecian and roman poets it consequently produces a stronger spirit in poetry when it is managed by those who have souls that are capable of expressing it  i could produce a hundred passages more out of sacred writ which are infinitely superior to any thing that can be brought upon the same subject from the grecian and roman poets  and the only reason why i refuse to do it is because it may be pretended that the writers in sacred writ had the peculiar advantage of divine inspiration and that no consequence can be drawn from them in the behalf of the moderns who pretend not to the same advantage and therefore i shall produce some instances of the preeminence of the christian over the pagan poets whose authors cannot be pretended to have been divinely assisted in a more peculiar manner than any of the moderns may be the first instance that i shall bring shall be from the hymn of st ambrose a father of the church who lived in the third century a hymn more exalted than either orphens or homer or callimachus ever produced i have given the former part of it a dress of my own through the which tho perhaps it may appear disguised to the reader yet even through that disguise he may discern a greatness and a beauty that are not every where to be found  te deum etc we praise thee o god   a long adieu to mortal lays our voice to immortal heights we raise and sing the great creators praise thy praise o god thy boundless praise in more than human sounds we sing o for an angels towering wing o rather for thy spirit to sustain each matchless strain that it may reach eternal heights and in its lofty daring flights the heaven of heavens may scale raise all your voices strike your strings it is god it is god we sing sound all and cry with one accord hail thou supreme of things the worlds great author hail hail infinite eternal king thee god above all heights adored we all confess and all obey prostrate and low and trembling all before thy dreadful majesty we fall acknowledging thy boundless sway   such homage to their eastern kings the indian and the persian brings but eastern kings alas to thee vain fantomes are of royalty that with a false delusive power appear and vanish in an hour for thee what homage shall we find infinite independent mind what homage worthy of the god that can unmake us with a nod look from thy awful throne on high and with thy omnipresent eye into our souls recesses pry there see a homage worthy thee worthy eternal majesty see profound humility see souls entirely mortified down senseless vanity and pride vile as thou art vain man appear behold omnipotence is here when he who only is when he appears what worms what mites are we nay we are not we only seem we are scarce a shadow scarce a dream a senseless dream of what is not that passes and is strait forgot thou only art for what thou art thou always wilt be always were for thou art permanent and fixed uncreated and unmixed the radiant heavens and rolling earth owe to thee their wondrous birth thou of ten thousand worlds art lord and art by every world adored they all confess thy power divine for thee they move for thee they shine and every worlds for ever thine   all the earth does worship thee the father everlasting and this great planet earth which rowls incessantly around its poles and till the end of time must run its giant race about the sun and moving round the lamp of day overtake the seasons in its way while slanting in its oblique flight it shortens or prolongs the night thee motions fountain and its source  worships in its endless course thee while it turns about the sphere accomplishing the mighty year its great creator thee it serves and thy eternal laws observes creatures to whom great mother earth fermented by thy flame gave birth all that on lybian mountains roar or flounder on the indian shore all that in airy caravans on high intelligent of seasons fly through the vast deserts of the aerial sky all to their maker adoration pay all constantly thy several laws obey which their distinguished tribes and different nations sway their seasons preordaind by thee they know at thy command they come at thy command they go   none but irregular man thy rightful sway impious irregular man dares disobey yet impious man too thee adores thee from cathaian to peruvian shores with nameless rites unnumberd tongues he every hour implores before thy feet earths numerous kingdoms all before thy feet a thousand monarchs fall and thee their everlasting father call and thus they cry thy potent breath our great forefather called from more than death when thou said let him be the sound drew him wondering from the ground to thee low the worlds great rulers bow thou art our god our mighty maker thou thou formst us at the first and thou sustainst us now   to thee all angels cry aloud now let us earth and earthly things disdain now let us sing a loftier strain now let our souls to heaven repair direct their most aspiring flight to fields of uncreated light and dare to draw empyreal air it is done oh place divinely bright oh sons of god divinely fair oh sight unutterable sight oh unconceivable delight oh joy which only gods can bear hark how their blissful notes they raise and sing the eternal makers praise how in extatick song they cry lo we the glorious sons of light so great so beautiful so bright lo we the brightest of created things who are all flame all force all spirit and all eye are yet but vile and nothing in thy sight before thy feet o mighty king of kings o maker of the boundless all thus lowly reverent we fall thou know how many of us fell to lowest shame and lowest hell but thou art holy thou o lord art only fit to be implored of sacred sabbath god adored and thus they pass eternity to thee all angels in the sky and all archangels loudly cry the mighty cherubim answer the staming seraphim holy continually they cry o holy holy holy lord of sacred sabbath god adored from them dominions catch the blissful so and  the glorious fugue prolong holy continually they cry the harmonious thunder rowls adown the skies and to the golden orbs it flies the vast intelligences all on fire with flaming zeal complete the immortal quire to sing thee great creator all conspire all ranks divinely touch the living lyre o holy holy holy lord of sacred sabbath god adored holy the empyreal spirits cry holy the regents of the orbs reply to the great strain they tune their spears and ravish even immortal ears and all the harmonious worlds on high accompany the song divine and in the eternal chorus join   thus thee they always worship all thee god of sacred sabbath call for thou have been of holyrest the angels speak from vast eternity possessed when all in you created mass does but appear and move and pass all moves all fluctuates without end but spirits that on thine depend yon glorious worlds that floating lie in the profound abyss of sky in matters stormy gulphs are tossed till in a flaming wrack they are lost we that so far with angels ken can trace thy godlike works along the boundless space see naught from endless agitation free but thee the great the eternal mover thee even we are moved even we are tossed in blissful rapture almost lost even we sometimes almost complain of transports that are near to pain which without thee we never could sustain thou movst us all yet ever blessed alone enjoyst perpetual rest thy great allseeing eyes never sleep and yet for everlasting days they sabbath sacred sabbath keep the wondrous subject of our praise but who tho mounted on an angels wing can ever hope to raise his flight to such a towering such a godlike height as thee with equal song to sing thee god over all worlds supreme who must not flag beneath the almighty theme whereere at utmost stretch we cast our eyes through the vast frightful spaces of the skies even there we find thy glory there we gaze on thy bright majestys unbounded blaze ten thousand suns prodigious globes of light at once in broad dimensions strike our sight millions behind in the remoter skies appear but spangles to our wearied eyes and when our wearied eyes want further strength to pierce the voids immeasurable length our vigorous towering thoughts still further fly and still remoter flaming worlds descry but even an angels comprehensive thought cannot extend so far as thou have wrought our vast conceptions are by swelling brought swallowed and lost in infinite to naught the next instance is from milton who in the seventh book of the paradise lost has handled the subject of the creation better than either ovid or virgil himself has done tho he is certainly above ovid by the force of his own genius as much as by the advantage of his religion but it is by the latter only that he excels virgil than whom i do not believe that any man can have a greater genius when i say that milton excels virgil i mean that he does so sometimes both in his thought and in his spirit purely by the advantage of his religion but at the same time i am very far from thinking that he so much as equals him either in the continual harmony of his versification or the constant of beauty of his expression or his perpetual exaltation he writ in a language that was not capable of so much beauty or so much harmony and his inequality proceeded from his want of art to manage his subject and make it constanly great for it would be an easy matter to prove that none of the moderns understood the art of heroic poetry who writ before bossu took pains to unravel the mystery but nothing can make more for my subject than to show that milton who lay under these vast disadvantages very often excelled even the prince of the roman poets both in the greatness of of his thought and his spirit  but first let us see how he surpasses ovid in his description of chaos and the creation of the world from chaos and in order to that let us see the account that the roman gives of it in the beginning of his metamorphosis  ante mare and terras and quod tegit omnia coelum unus erat toto naturae vultus in orb quem dixere chaos rudis indistaque mole nec quicquam nisi pondus iners congestaque eodem non been junctarum discordia semina rerum nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina titan nec novo crescendo reparabat cornua phaebe nec circumfuso pendebat in aere tellus ponderibus librata suis nec brachia longo margin terrarum porrexerat amphitrite quaque erat and tellus illac and pontus and aer sic erit instabilis tellus innabilis unda lucis egens aer nulli sua forma manebat obstabatque aliis aliud quia corpore in uno frigida pugnabant calidis humentia siccis mollia cum duris sine pondere habentia pondus and thus mr dryden has translated it in the beginning of the third miscellany  before the seas and this terrestial ball and heavens high canopy which covers all one was the face of nature if a face rather a rude and indigested mass a lifeless lump unfashiond and unframd of jarring seeds and justly chaos named no sun was lighted up the world to view no moon did yet her blunted horns renew nor yet was earth suspended in the sky nor poised did on her own foundations lie nor seas about the shore their arms had thrown but earth and air and water were in one thus air was void of light and earth unstable and waters dark abyss unnavigable no certain form on any was impressed all were confused and each disturbed the rest for hot and cold were in one body fixed and soft with hard and light with heavy mixed let us examine miltons description of chaos in the second book of paradise lost where he shows satan and sin and death taking a survey of it from hells gate  before their eyes in sudde view appear the secrets of the hoary deep a dark illimitable ocean without bound without dimension where length breadth and height and time and place are lost where eldest night and chaos ancestors of nature hold eternal anarchy amidst the noise of endless wars and by confusion stand for hot cold moist and dry four champions fierce strive here for mastery and to battle bring their embryon atoms they around the flag of each his faction in their several clans light armed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow swarm populous unnumberd as the sands of barca or cyrenes torrid soil levied to side with warring winds and poise their lighter wings to whom those most adhere he rules a moment chaos umpire sits and by decision more embroils the prey by which he reigns now i leave it to any reader to judge who has never so little discernment in these affairs which of these descriptions is most fine most figurative and most poetical but now let us see how ovid begins his account of the creation  hanc deus and melior litem natura diremit nam coelo terras and terris abscidit undas et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aere coelum quae postquam evolvit caecoque exemit acervo dissociata locis concordi pace ligavit ignea convexi vis et sine pondere coeli emicuit summaque locum sibi legit in arce proximus est aer illi levitate locoque densior his tellus elementaque grandiatraxit et pressa est gravitate sui circum fluus humor ultima possedit solidumque coercrit orbem and thus mr dryden has made it english  but god or nature while they thus contend to these intestine discords put an end then earth from air and seas from earth were driven and grosser air sunk from aetherial heaven thus disembroild they take their properplace the next of kin contiguously embrace and foes are sunderd by a larger space the force of fire ascended first on high and took its dwelling in the vaulted sky then air succeeds in lightness next to fire whose atoms from unactive earth retire earth sinks beneath and draws a numerous throng of pondrous thick unweildy seeds along about her coasts unruly waters roar and rising on a ridge insult the shore but how poor is this beginning compared to the pompous preparative with which milton ushers in his account of the same thing in the seventh of his paradise lost  heaven opened wide her ever during gates harmonious sound on golden hinges moving to let forth the king of glory in his powerful word and spirit coming to create new worlds on heavenly ground they stood and from the shore they viewed the vast immeasurable abyss outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild up from the bottom turned by furious winds and surging waves as mountains to assault heavens height and with the center mix the pole silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace said then the omnifick world your discord end nor staid but on the wings of cherubim up lifted in paternal glory rode far into chaos and the world unborn for chaos heard his voice him all his train followed in bright procession to behold creation and the wonders of his might and it is plain that milton owes this greatness and this elevation to the excellence of his religion how mean is  ignea convexi vis and sine pondere caeli emicuit summaque locum siti legit in arce to miltons description of the first great fial  let there be light said god and forthwith light ethereal first of things quintessence pure sprung from the deep and from her native east to journey through the airy gloom began spheard in a radiant cloud how low is the formation of earth and sea in ovid compared to miltons  principio terram ne non aequalis ab omni parteforet magni speciam glomeravit in orbis tum freta diffudit rapidisque tumesecre ventis jussit et ambitae circumdare littora terrae jussit and extendi campos subsidere valles fronde tegi sylvas lapidosos surgere montes thus when the god whatever god was he had formed the whole and made the parts agree that no unequal portions might be found he molded earth into a spacious round then with abreath he gave thewinds to blow and bad the congregated waters flow he shades the woods the valleys he restrains with rocky mountains and extends the plains let us now see miltons account of this  the earth was formed but in the womb as yet of waters embryon immature involved appeared not over all the face of earth main ocean flowed not idle but with war prolifick humor softening all her globe fermented the great mother to conceive satiate with moisture when god said be gathered now ye waters under heaven into one place and let dry land appear immediately the mountains huge appear emergent and their broad bare backs up heave into the clouds their tops ascend the sky what an image is here and taken apparently from ourreligion which teaches us the most exalted notions of god and the immediate obedience of the creatures to their creator but milton goes on and at the same time sets before us another wonderful sight  so high as heaven the tumid hills sloow down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep capacious bed of waters but milton goes on  and god said let the earth put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed and fruittree yiedling fruit after her kind these three verses are cold and flat and inharmonious for there can be no true harmony in numbers without passion but let us see whether the verses that follow will make amends for them  he scarce had said when the bare earth till then desert and bare unsightly unadorned brought fourth the tender grass whose verdure clad her universal face with pleasant green then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowrd opening their various colors and made gay her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown forth flourished thick the clustring vine forth crept the smelling gourd up stood the cornie reed embattelld in her field and the humble shrub and bush with frizled hair implicit last rose as in dance the stately trees what an image is here again with which none but our own religion could have possibly supplied him  let us now examine virgils account of the beginning of the world in the sixth eclogue and see if we can meet with any thing that may be compared to these thoughts of milton which at the same time that they are wonderful are simple and are naturally produced by the subject  namque canebat uti magnum per inane coact a semina terrarumque animaeque marisque fuissent et liquidi simul ignis utque his exordia primis omnia and ipse tener mundi concr everit orbis tum durare solum and discl udera nerca ponto caeperit and rerum paulatim sumere formas jamque novum ut stupeant terrae lucescere solemn altius atque cadant submotis nubibus imbres incipiant sylvae cum primum surgere cumque rara per ignotos errant animalia montes which by mr dryden is thus translated  he sung the secret seeds of natures frame how seas and earth and air and active flame fell through the mighty void and in their fall were blindly gathered in this goodly ball the tender soil then stiffning by degrees shut from the bounded earth the bounding seas then earth and ocean various forms disclose and a new sun to the new world arose and mists condensed to clouds obscure the sky and clouds dissolved the thirsty ground supply the rising trees the lofty mountains grace the lofty mountains feed the savage race but few and strangers in the unpeopled place and now any one may see how much virgils god is inferior to miltons angel it is true i know very well that it may be urged in virgils behalf that he does not pretend to set down silenus his song but only the principal heads of it whereas milton makes the angel raphael give an account at large of the creation i know this very well i say but i am satisfied at the same time that virgil making silenus proceed upon the epicurean hypothesis if he had given never so full and artful an account of the creation could never possibly have equaled milton for that hypothesis runs directly counter to those lofty thoughts and those noble images which milton has shown in such wondrous motion for these verses  tum durare solum and discludere nerca ponte caeperit and rerum paulatim sumere formas and this  rara per ignotos errent animalia montes are directly contradictory of those noble images which we find in the following account of milton  the sixth and of creation last arose with evening harps and mattin when god said let the earth bring forth fruit living in her kind cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth each in their kind here are four flat unmusical verses again but those which follow will more than make amends for them  the earth obeyed and strait opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth innumerous living creatures perfect forms limbed and full grown out of the ground up rose as from his laire the wild beast where he wonns in forest wild in thicket brake or den among the trees in pairs they rose they walked the cattle in the fields and meadows green those rare and solitary these in flocks pasturing at once and in broad herds up sprung the grassy clods now calvd now half appeared the tawny lion pawing to get free his hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds and rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce the libbard and the tiger as the moale rising the crumbling earth about them threw in hillocks the swift stag from under ground bore up his branching head scarce from his mold behemoth biggest born of earth up heaved it is vastness what a number of admirable images are here crowding upon one another so natural and peculiar to the subject that they would have been as absurd and extravagant in any other as they are wonderfully just in this and yet even in this subject nothing could have supplied a poet with them but so divine a religion so that at the same time that the eye is ravishingly entertained admiration is raised to a height and the reason is supremely satisfied for are not these effects that are worthy of an infinite cause can any thing be more surprizingly strong than this energetick image  now half appeared the tawny lion pawing to get free his hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds and rampant shakes his brinded mane is not the following one great and wonderful  the ounce the libbard and the tiger as the moale rising the crumbling earth about them threw in
