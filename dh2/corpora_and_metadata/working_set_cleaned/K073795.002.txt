ninth  mutual selfreproof or the tale of cadwal  in two parts  the candid mind by acknowledging and discarding its faults has reason and truth for the foundation of all its passions and desires and

the tale of cadwal part i i dark december was the month the air was dank and chill when cadwals weary foot had reached the summit of the hill ii beneath whose ample verge he wont to labor at the plough and to relieve his fathers age bedew his infant brow iii when eighteen years had over him passed he left his rustic home soresmote with grief in distant grounds and strangerfields to roam iv twelve winters had his exile seen when lo his bosom burns again to clasp his fathers knees and homeward he returns v and now descending to the vale with slow and trembling feet reviewing this his native soil the pulses fluttering beat vi and now with penetrating eye he pierces the close dell where in his thatchbeshelterd cot his sire did whilom dwell vii yet in his sad and troubled look such terror might ye see as when we almost wish to shun the thing we wish should be viii he pryed here he pryed there no cottage could he spy nor smallest trace of human tread appeared to his eye ix no monarch of the feathered brood was heard aloud to crow nor labored ox the vocal air awaken with his low x in strange amazement and suspense awhile benumbed he stood then fell despairing on the earth and wept and waild aloud xi his piercing cries an hermit drew forth from his lonely cell whose pliant sense was quick to feel afflictions poignant yell xii compassion held him mute at first while as he pondered him with fixed eye where natures floods upswelled to the brim xiii then thus  my son your plaints i heard they smote me to the heart to me without reserve or fear the weighty cause impart xiv deepversd in sorrows plaintive task full many a weary hour right well i know what aggravates and what abates its power xv closepent within restraining bounds the river foams and roars tumultuous

struggling griefs to flow which thy clogged heart oppress each word will take a part away and make the burden less xviii old cadwal here distraught i seek here cadwal dwelt of yore here here his quiet cottage rose but now is here no more xix old cadwal seekst thou hapless man new torments must thou have  beneath this venerable elm behold the rustics grave xx oh wretch accursd i was the cause i reft him of his breath i robbed these fields of cadwals worth i brought him to his death xxi was he not to his various kin unworthy i alone was he not guardian comforter friend father all in one xxii what honest hind that near him toiled but of his store partook was he not to the needy swain as to the mead the brook xxiii did he not deal to all around his smile as well as care not even the sparrow of the hedge but in his love had share xxiv and wretch accursed i was the cause i reft him of his breath i robbed these fields of cadwals worth i brought him to his death xxv too rigidly perchance my son thyself thou do accuse and heapest on thy burdened heart unnecessary woes xxvi ah how severe the punishment when we ourselves arraign and hatred often and malice self inflict a milder pain xxvii less harshly censure thy offense some youthful warmth i ween and give it to mine ear in terms soft candid and serene xxviii here on this bank repose awhile and bid these tumults cease with thine i will mix my social tears and sooth returning peace xxix ah father this thine holy love embitters what i feel unwittingly thou addst a sting to sorrows thou would heal xxx here on this bank what precious hours ive known in days of youth listning the precepts that he gave of wisdom and of truth xxxi here in the sweetlytranquil eve days rugged labor done hed tell how good and glorious men lifes arduous race had run xxxii what tides of blood had washed these lands which we in peace had tilled and how the faithful rustic once great alfred here concealed xxxiii but oh my griefbewilderd mind from reason wanders far and with vague fancies idly mocks thy kind thy pious care xxxiv heed not my son  use any means that may assuage thy pain it is the privilege of woe at random to complain xxxv and who of patient sympathy the liberal largess scant withold a bounty great i ween as wealth can shower on want part ii i old cadwal here distraught i seek  ah me this wayward heart that dared oppose a fathers power that dared his counsel thwart ii but emmas charms had won my love and made it all her own i sought not copious flocks and meads i sought content alone iii and oh so sweetly she conformed to all i wished or said you would have sworn our hearts as twins were for each other made iv and was it holy father say was it a crime to love or to my earlyplighted vows unchangd and steady prove v matildas lofty friends in store of riches did abound and ample sheaves enriched their meads and orchards rose around vi and those possessions every hour were poured into mine ear to count them over my father made his morn and evening care vii sure if he any sailing had twas too fond love for me hence sprang the wish that of her fields i should the master be viii and as he wished and as he bade o that i could have done but emmas charms had won my love and made it all her own ix say father ought i in the church have joined matildas hand when love and truth that should attend were not at my command x her spacious granaries  to me they no allurement were my emmas lowroofd dairyhut to me was dearer far xi why after large possessions seek my father knew no want of copious tributes from the field his barns were nothing scant xii but twas his will  and oh that i that will could have obeyed without the guilt of broken vows or emmas peace betrayed xiii now that my frowardness of heart hath brought him to his end for this beside yon hallowed sod in duteous wise i will bend xiv for this will daily wet the turf with my repentant eye nor ever from this solitude to fairer refuge fly xv son quoth the sage and cast a look as chilled the youth all over while minutes past ere vital warmth his senses did restore  xvi son quoth the sage thy doubts suspend their swelling tumults check it is thy father clasps thee thus and weeps upon thy neck xvii long have i held thee in discourse with pentup agony now let my gushing tears have way they are blessings showerd on thee xviii charmed with thy duteous excellence thy strength of filial love my full forgiveness let these streams and warm embraces prove xix and oh can thou forgive the cause that drove thee from thy home soresmote with grief in distant grounds and strangerfields to roam xx can i forgive  oh father such unseemly terms restrain can i forgive  it is enough i see thee once again xxi but said thou not beneath yon elm  my dearest son i did there have i marked my chosen spot there made my latest bed xxii of thee berest what booted it to tend the furrowed plain or what from autumns fruitful lap to heap the ripened grain xxiii whom had i then to cheer my steps in summers sultry rays for whom should then the social hearth in winterevning blaze xxiv my house my barns i left at large to moulder and decay yon humble tenement i raised my ages only stay xxv enough for me who meant forlorn to pass lifes dragging eve my task to meditate and pray  my punishment to grieve xxvi for oh my son too late i felt this truth within my heart that to compel the filial mind is not a parents part xxvii and hence this penitential garb and hence these silver hairs whose hoary length the sad recluse or pensive hermit wears xxviii dear honored father droop no more thus on my bended knee i crave i claim  renounce thy griefs cast cast them all on me xxix with unremitting love and care thy sorrows i will assuage and with obsequious duty tend the remnant of thy age xxx arise my son and to my cell together let us wend let us beneath one roof embrace ere yet my days shall end xxxi and shall the thought of emmas love no more suffuse thine eye nor chide thy father for her loss  shes buried in this sigh xxxii what wondrous bliss to virtuous minds will heaven not deign to lend within my homely hut my son there all thy sorrows end xxxiii there there still sweetlyfair once more thy emma shall thou see within my homely hut she dwells my ages comfort she xxxiv her father dead i filled his place the guardian of her youth i now restore her to thy love thy wishes and thy truth xxxv young cadwal waited not for more but to his emma flew wherc locked awhile in close embrace each to the other grew xxxvi from incoherent words and sighs such wondrous transports brake far more than honeyd eloquence with all her tongues could speak xxxvii and now with strong enquiring look they search each others eye to ask if what they see be true and doubt the real joy xxxviii anon the fathers quickening steps they greet with bended grace and with uplifted eyes adore and bless his reverend face xxxix now by this hallowed eve i vow probably christmaseve as december is the month mentioned in the opening of the tale  soon as the mass be done the next ensuing holy day the priest shall make ye one xl and ye shall live so heaven permit to cast one gleam of light athwart your fathers gathering eve or ere he sink in night xli or ere beneath yon aged elm he is numbered with the dead the chosen spot where his own hands have made his latest bed xlii but while some hours of life are lent by gratitude and prayer repentant of my errors past those errors i will repair xliii and often as i recount them over thy steady faith i will praise and for my dearest boy once more the social hearth shall blaze xliv age even as youth thou see my son is liable to fall and selfreproof and penitence alike beseem us all this tale of cadwal having been through mistake forgotten to be mentioned in the preface it is proper to do it now it was printed many years ago in a collection of letters but was read by so few at that time that the author has been induced to make it part of this publication  tale the tenth  retribution or the tale of durand  blessed is he who considers the poor and needy psalms address to mrs b  charlotte to thee whose gentle breast of innate goodness is possessed to thee a friendly muse appeals for truth of what her tale reveals from gallias once delightful shore thy sire the late john rich esquire patentee of the theater royal covent garden the sacred symbol bore and often exulted to expand the test of an almighty hand the wondrous test of bounty given to humble worth by favoring heaven thy sire the wellrememberd name lays on the muse a sacred claim to speak his fascinating power who waked to glee the scenic hour the private walk of life endeared and many an aching bosom cheered who lived applauded and approved and died regretted and beloved this thy dear parents wellearnd praise deserves the mead of richer lays here might the muse with volant quill from cowley cowley near uxbridge the seat of the late mr rich pass to sweet rosehill rose hill at hampton in middlesex the name of mr beards villa  with memory take a random flight whirled in delirium of delight dwell on the name of johnny beard the friend who every spot endeared recording the familiar chat often here he strayed and there he sat or all beneath yon aged oak he twirld the pun or coined the joke or lengthened out the evening walk on subjects grave in moral talk or cheerly waked the rosy morn with chaunting clear his early horn of more exalted worth the muse would speak but needless were the task and words too weak for his innate benevolence of soul fond to dispense the charitable dole that energy wherewith he sought the haunt of crippled age of malady or want mr beard might with great propriety and truth have adopted the phrase which that ingenious writer mr cumberland has put into the mouth of sheva in his comedy of the jew i do not tak of charity i feel it  and all the virtues which the muse could find lodged in the casket of his consorts mind which scarce a masons pen could amply grace will be recorded in a better place the tale of durand within the placid isle of france the isle of france is that peculiar province wherein the city of paris stands and obtained the name of an island from its situation which lies between the rivers seine marne oise and aisne the soil is in general remarkably fertile  scene once of taste and elegance when paris from her regal bound gave fashions to a world around durand resided frugal swain and cultured his paternal plain with daily care he dressed the land and earned his food from natures hand contented with his humble state he envied not the rich or great each morn he rose with decent pride his comfortable roof he eyed the gardens growth surveyed with care admired each useful product there now traced with an enamored look the sweetlywinding limpid brook marked where his fertile meads extended by woods from eastern blasts defended then on his grateful knees would fall and thank the bounteous lord of all in his plain heart much room had he for well placed liberality bounteous not lavish of his pelf he loved his neighbor as himself but at distress or hungers call he showed himself a friend to all with daily toil his ground he tilled with constant care each season filled from his own hand each eve he fed the labored ox and weary steed and with endearing touch approved the labors of the beast he loved jean shared the drudgry of the field manon domestic duties filled dear children of a dearer wife the gentle sweetners of his life to matins and to vespers true they paid their maker homage due on sabbath days with fervent mind the public worship constant joined and in the evening sports were seen to join the dance upon the green such was the custom such the lore parisians used in days of yore but decent pastimes now are done rule order nay religion gone the very name of sabbath flown and decads count their time alone but i digress  the good durand rich in the tribute of his land as all the neighboring farmers were who dwelld within that province fair with honest pride rejoiced to see the produce of his industry one year unwonted in that isle incessant rains oppressed the soil the seed even perished in its birth and nature owned a general dearth avare with wealth and pride oergrown who knew no interest but his own who never sought the dreary shed where want reclined his aching head who could rebuke with ruthless lower the famished stranger from his door beheld the dearth with joyous look and thus the neighboring swains bespoke now is the time for us my friends to use our stores for wisest ends it is ours the price to regulate and fix it at the highest rate fools only such occasions lose and fortunes proffered means a buse the thrifty are the truly wise who watch each change with wary eyes each distant means of gain discern and to their own advantage turn durand heard all but homeward sped with musing gait and downcast head and at the closing hour of rest the great creator thus addressed father of all who know my heart search and correct each sinful part never may illegal thirst of gain or sordid craft my bosom stain if ever accumulated store make me against misery close my door for worthier beings oh reserve the blessings i should ill deserve of means to succor while possessed if rigor steel my callous breast let me the want i slight endure and make me poorest of the poor but now while scarcity prevails and natures wonted bounty fails ought i from treasured hoards refuse a moderate share for general use or added profit dare to grind from the afflictions of mankind no  what thy bounty heaped on me to others i will distribute free and if i act as i profess may thou the resolution bless he spoke and felt the dew of sleep in soft repose his senses steep in blissful dreams he passed the night and cheerly hailed returning light but cold and dreary looked the ground a melancholy blank around instead of autumns golden grain a barren winter seemed to reign durand beheld his neighbourband for small supplies make high demand yet sanctimoniously he kept the promise plighted ere he slept with scorn the profit he declined wrung from the affliction of mankind at easy rates his grain he shared nay something to the needy spared thus in relieving others blessed smiled and enjoyed unbroken rest but mark what miracles appear to signalize the ensuing year let not the doubting or the bold deride the wonders i unfold for lips that never knew deceit to me the story did repeat and made each heart with pleasure thrill in sweet discoursings at rosehill the ensuing autumn saw the ground in grain of every kind abound each husbandman with joy beheld the swelling product of his field but chief durand  before whose view scarce crediting the vision true each rising stem was seen to bear replete with grain a triple ear this was the symbol alluded to in the address mr rich was not only an eye witness to this wonderful production in its state of vegetation but likewise brought several of them to england and showed them to all his visitors  and none save his prolific field so plenteous a display did yield the marvel quickly gathered fame from distant quarters numbers came all gazed with wonder some with spite some with extravagant delight tendring a gratulating hand to the loved owner of the land durand the merciful and good in silence breathed his gratitude  avare who mingled in the crowd astounded stood  then thus aloud often have i dared in accents rude deny the existence of a god too often absurdly dared advance that all is the effect of chance but wonders such as here are shown must spring from power divine alone tale the eleventh  the test of love or the tale of edward and orra  address to w wilberforce esquire m p i to thee muchhonourd wilberforce a strangermuse her tribute pays and aims thy merits to record in weak but welldirected praise ii to thee of right the tale belongs whose pitying heart partakes the pain of wretches who in distant lands are galled with slavrys rankling chain iii on thy persuasive choice of words and the mild accents of thy tongue with mute attention and delight often has a british senate hung iv to pity woes which we have felt a partial virtue only proves and he who serves a friend distressed but mitigates the heart he loves v but who compassionates the fate of suffrers whom he never has known this universal love displays this wilberforce is all thine own vi oh had i but the power of verse might with a masons talents vie thy firm disinterested zeal oh miserys friend should never die introduction i thy favors nature goddess dear are not to place or sphere confined to shape complexion or degree they are dealt at large among mankind ii whatever in station title dress bright and respectable we find nature the brilliant polish gives that graces and exalts the mind iii colin by birth decreed to share the servile labors of the field or watch beneath the milkers hand his herds their steaming fullness yield iv when by his few selected friends encircled at his homely board displayed an elegance of mind that might have graced the proudsst lord v colin had gracious been and mild though born over tartars rude to reign and george been pious great and good though born an humble village swain vi the attributes to regal sway a cold obedience may invite but it is the goodness of his heart that to obedience adds delight vii natives of europe wherefore boast the fair complexion of a skin it is not how climates act without but how great nature works within viii the beauteous tint which she displays engages wisdoms sober eye beyond the fairest outward form that blooms beneath our milder sky ix nay love itself has shone as bright as pure as tender and as true beneath an africs sable breast as ever british bosom knew x how hearts of moorish climes have loved how long how constant and how well let edwards and his orras tale in plain and simple numbers tell the tale of edward and orra all the principal events whereon this tale is founded occurred in a private family in the city of london and that so recently as about the middle of the present century  part i i within angolas regal bounds on africs wild and sultry waste were juba and his orra born and lifes brief morn together passed ii yet on that drear unculturd soil nature their tender minds impressed with early sense of right and wrong and poured her softness over each breast iii or ere ten years had crowned their youth from kin and country were they torn for sordid ore to slavery sold to strange and different climates borne iv mates in their infant sports they grieved when sunderd from each others side and with their tears a farewell took as either vessel cut the tide v she by the master of her fate was landed on barbados isle there to a wealthy merchant sold mid groups of fellowslaves to toil vi and many a heavy hour she passed as over her painful task she hung and sometimes thought of juba lost and now she wept and now she sung vii the music of her plaintive voice attracted every listening ear and her demeanor meek and kind to each good heart made orra dear viii but chief her younger mistress breast her ditties wild to pity moved as through the circuit of the grounds the gentle anna daily roved ix some three years more advanced in age often would the british maiden stray where patient orra plied her task to listen to her artless lay x at her request the tender moor was from the field of labor led from scorching suns and rulers harsh and to domestic duties bred xi here all she was prescribed to learn with docile cheerfulness attained unconscious of her own desert she daily praise and favor gained xii and when her evening task was over ofttime would anna soothe her forth to wander in the cedargrove and learn the story of her birth xiii as often in tears would orra tell of parents to her heart scarce known who sent her into stranger lands unblessed unfriended and alone xiv hence an attachment mutual grew nor could a sisters love be more than annas susceptible heart to poor deserted orra bore xv here orra found a better home for many a rising happy year dear to the equals of her state nor less to her superiors dear xvi and here fidelity and love attached and lengthened orras stay until with mingled smiles and tears she witnessed annas bridal day part ii i meantime the ship which juba bore to mild virginias harbor sailed there a new master juba owned whose desperate schemes in traffic failed ii whether twere ignorance or neglect or dissipation thinnd his gold but all his hopes were scattered wide slaves lands and buildings all were sold iii when for integrity renowned and sense above his servile sphere juba so fate ordained allured the notice of the british peer iv who then by equitable laws virginias rich plantation swayed and in his lords esteem and love a daily progress juba made v for in all knowledge that became his station an adept he grew true to the talents nature lent and to his masters interest true vi approved instructed and beloved an easy servitude he wore and by his lord was still retained when home recalled to britains shore vii the peer right noble by descent but nobler in a generous mind lamenting that a virtuous heart should be in slavish bonds confined viii when settled in his native land his faithful juba thus addressed who in his masters cital kneeled with sore dismay and doubt oppressed ix rise faithful man no longer sigh beneath base slavrys grievous thrall here in this happy land enjoy that dower our laws afford to all x henceforth be free religions hand shall seal thee with a mark divine  that done thine own assenting will and that alone can make thee mine xi he led him to the sacred font with newenkindled hopes inflamed the holy rituals were performed and juba now is edward named xii with pride he to his lords abode returned and with redoubled zeal he strove by actions to express what words were powerless to reveal xiii often he essayed in vain to speak the love and duty of his breast as often convulsive sobs and tears with swelling throes his voice suppressed xiv his lord the painful strugglings felt fraught with intelligence refined with smile complacent soothed his pain and in his silence read his mind xv first favorite in his masters train some years in comfort edward lived nor felt a pain but when his heart for orras dubious fortune grieved xvi nor did good edward ever forget he wore a christians sacred sign but duly sought the house of prayer and worshipped at the holy shrine part iii i time that unravels every doubt time that allays the keenest smart that wondrous mysteries unfolds to vex or please the human heart ii at this blessed prime of edwards youth wrought forth a singular event a sweet return for edwards worth as by his better angel sent iii for now unwieldy grown in wealth fair annas parents strongly yearn to barter their barbadian lands and to their native clime return iv the lands are sold at mighty price and now for england they prepare with orra in their train to lend the infant family her care v four daughters now her mistress owned whom orras fond attention reared but none to orras tender heart like lovely anna was endeared vi arrived in safety they select a dwelling fit for upstart pride hence in contiguous mansions placed edward and orra now reside vii when bliss to worthy hearts is dealt some call it fortunes casual dower forgive the muse if she ascribes such bliss to a superior power viii edward at sound of orras name yearns to engage in converse sweet when soon comparing past events their hearts with mutual rapture beat ix their infant moments they recount their separation on the main and edward pours a shower of tears on his dear playmate found again x no wonder such an early bent should to maturer passion rise they felt alike the kindling flame and read it in each others eyes xi they plighted love they plighted troth he vowed to live for her alone and soon as fit occasion served connubial rites should make them one xii but midst these secret hours of bliss a sudden grief smote edwards heart his lord a rapid fever seized that baffled medicinal art xiii retired to taste his villas sweets a blast of noxious evening wind conveyed a poison to his veins and wrought insanity of mind xiv swift to the villa edward flew he left awhile his orra dear strong gratitude impelled his heart to make his lord his only care xv and she with patient smile approved and yielded to the sacred claim which bounty lays on generous minds for orras bosom felt the same xvi o could it be that in the hours to pious offices assigned when edward with unceasing care and with a soreafflicted mind xvii watched every breath his master drew felt every groan that smote his ear and for returning sense and health made every thought a fervent prayer xviii in such a season could it be that annas cruel parents strove by sordid treachry to divide poor orra from her edwards love xix it was  o passion sprung from hell unmitigable thirst of gold to what base deeds do thou impell the bosom that is by thee controlled xx thus ruminated annas sire  should edward take this orras hand conduct her to the altars foot and once be joined in nuptial band xxi no remedy were left for me  a christian made my slave is lost a christians wife with him she goes and with her all the gold she cost xxii it shall not be  this very hour a vessel in the river rides bound straight for carolinas bay and only waits for favoring tides xxiii her husband i  tomorrows sun shall be the last of orras stay for at the approaching midnight hour shall she be sudden borne away xxiv a man perchance to gain devote for orras fate might little grieve but that his wife should yield assent what gentle female will believe xxv though pearly drops from orras eyes adown her jetty bosom fell while in convulsive sobs she cried o let me bid him one farewell xxvi yet all was vain  not orras prayers her years of faithful service spent nor lovely annas fond request could make the mothers heart relent xxvii no rot the assembled childrens tears whom orras tender care had reared could draw one drop of pity down against all her callous breast was seared xxviii the word was passed  the morrows sun was doomed the last of orras stay and at the ensuing midnight hour was faithful orra torn away part iv i now by his suffering masters bed some fourteen wretched days had passed which edward spent in ceaseless moan nor left him till he breathed his last ii nor left him then but joined the rites that laid him in his peaceful home and bending over the coffined clay shed grateful sorrows in the tomb iii but what was now his wild surprise on learning that his lords regard had for his faithful services bequeathed an annual rich reward iv one hundred annual pounds  how blessed might now this worthy couple prove from slavery orra might be freed or bound alone to him and love v swift to the wonted haunt he flew to pour the news in orras ear but like a statue breathless stood when told your orra is not here vi ungratefully she left the house where she had fostered been so long he groaned  he stamped  he rent his hair but mute and motionless his tongue vii at length a bursting flood of tears gave ease to his oerloaded breast and just supplied sufficient strength of words to make one short request viii where is she gone  no answer came to silence all the train were sworn to keep closelockd from edwards ear when how or whither she was borne ix but anna who lamented sore her orra thus by craft betrayed wrote carolina on a card and to his hands by stealth conveyed x he sought and soon a passage gained he saw with joy the streamers spread and daily chid the loitring waves that all so slow the vessel sped xi at length the wished for port is gained he searches each plantation round nor till some eight long days are passed can orras sad resort be found xii his eyes discover her at last beneath the toil of noontide suns he folds her in one short embrace then

while thus i trace each charm of that alluring face her converse sweet again i hear her judgment strong conception clear her turn for raillery and wit impressive elegant and neat such was she when her partial praise with smiles approved these early lays now though that flattering praise be over those cheering smiles exist no more shall i a second sanction choose to shield a cold forgetful muse no  be the page as first designed the tribute of a grateful mind to her and friendship still consigned preface as the author of the following work does not presume either to support or deny the reality of apparitions he chooses to decline all unnecessary suggestions on a subject wherein every person has a right to enjoy his own opinion undisturbed and as it was conceived with a view of instruction and the whole tendency is moral and just he hopes with the generality of readers to pass uncensured for treating them with so peculiar a story  if there should remain any overscrupulous or overwitty persons who are inclined peremptorily to condemn or illiberally to deride him he begs leave to answer them with the sentiments of mr addison on such subjects and those of lucretius and josephus quoted by him in the second volume of his spectator  i think a person who is thus terrified with the imaginations of ghosts and specter much more reasonable than one who contrary to the reports of all historians sacred and profane ancient and modern and to the traditions of all nations thinks the appearance of spirits fabulous and groundless  could i not give myself up to this general testimony of mankind i should to the relations of particular persons who are now living and whom i cannot distrust in other matters of fact so far mr addisons own opinion  he then proceeds   lucretius himself though by the course of his philosophy he was obliged to maintain that the soul did not exist separate from the body makes no doubt of the reality of apparitions and that men have often appeared after their death and further having related from josephus a circumstance of this kind which befell glaphira daughter of archelaus he closes his discourse thus the example deserves to be taken notice of as it contains a most certain proof of the immortality of the soul and of divine providence  if any man thinks these facts incredible let him enjoy his own opinion to himself but let him not endeavor to disturb the belief of others who by instances of this nature are excited to the study of virtue  to the testimony of this excellent modern writer might likewise be added the many striking uses which have been made and the noble purposes of justice which have been effected through the means of such extraordinary appearances by several of our ancient poets and particularly by that honor to nature and genius our own immortal shakespeare  the advantages of repentance the following tale was given to the public above twenty years ago unconnected with any other work it had the good fortune to pass

expression weak and tuneless numbers i attempt to sing thrice had the sun renewed his annual course since hapless edward on the sultry plains of india had endured increasing woes and numbered all his moments by afflictions when the fourth year began to store the earth with fruits and flowers unlimited expanse and prodigality of bounty edward arose one morn cheered by refreshing sleep which long had been a stranger to his bed his heart was light within him and his eye looked clear around the dross within his breast which limd his soul to guilt seemed purged away he heaved the softening sigh and as by instinct bent low to heaven  a posture new to him he did not pray  he knew not what to ask while thus twixt doubt and sore dismay suspended officious memory set before his view an awful

wide fast and copious did they flow as erst the streams forth deluged from the hardened rock touched and resolved by moses holy wand his pains awhile relieved edward aloud discharged his grief ah woe is me thus tossed upon a foreign shore robbed of relief of hope no sorrowing sister to condole no mother to advise no more i boast a feeling friend to share my nearest woe and ease me of a part where is the man whom once i wrapped close close within my heart and called his soul my own  he is lost  estranged  and justly  since with rash misguided step i left a parent comfortless a sister friendless and unprotected whom my labors might have preserved to better fate than now i fear attends them what have i attained by one black deed one moments cursed work but anguish and despair each slender morsel earned by hard labor and each niggard draught embitterd by distress oh were that morsel the honest meed of virtue and that draught the pay of genuine worth how sweet how grateful but as it is  how nauseous hence away no more i will bear this massacre of life this ruin of the soul  there is a power or nature whispers to my heart in vain who can and will restore me to myself to him to him i bend  and here disclaim the vices of my youth o could i wipe their traces from my mind that cannot be amidst transgressions huge and numerous one stands foremost never to be expunged one crime which even to myself i dare not name but if deep sorrow and sincere remorse may ought avail to expiae the sin it is now within me and shall there remain the tenant of my bosom if my god that name how sweet it sounds upon my ear deigns to accept my offered penitence i yet may triumph over distress i yet may shield a sister yet relieve a mother and far as memory will admit may cure my minds wide wounds

turned to florid health and vigor while the draught ran fresh within the veins and quickened life he toiled he prosperd  every moment gave some large addition to his store and heaven indulgent smiled on all he undertook mean while his mother tender good maria on albions isle left sorrowing pined away in anguish for a son her only stay in life was lost her daughters sole defense since torn from fortune in their earlier days his industry alone maintained the pair whenever she ventured all alone to open the volume of her mind she saw him here is and lost in one sad moment  snatched away as twere by sudden fate  one hour the board smiled at his presence on the next was blank  and fruitless every eye looked forth for edward no traces left of him his course unknown his motives his distress in vain enquiry panted on every various wind to find him thus over their sorrows did this couple brood and drank their falling tears when ghastly poverty intruded and with meagre hungry look appalled each comely visage wide he strode and with a horrid joy cried all is mine what hope remains alas for worth distressed and modest want unless some noble being comes timely like a minister of heaven to succor and redress in largess wide to pour his bounties and prevent the blush ere yet it rises on the conscious cheek of merit undisposd unused to ask such was marias happy lot ah would the sons of

before had tied their hearts reciprocal she gave her last her only bliss away poured forth her blessings profusely over the newmatchd pair  then turned to seek the house of poverty again a mate with lonely woe  when thus the youth  much as i dote on annas worth and live but in her smile a something yet to life were wanting if maria will not grace my home in earliest youth alas i lost the name of

rekindle in her aged heart thus flew twelve years on pleasures silken wing and all was comfort peace and happiness now had the banished man persisting still in penitence to heaven and love of virtue accumulated wealth beyond the bounds of what his largest hope displayed and yearnd spite of the fears that lingered round his heart with ardent wish to seek his native clime to see if annas youth was yielded up a prey to lawless love if early sorrow had nipt the bud and blasted all the fruit whether again twere given him to behold a mothers face to tend and cheer her age with duteous care and love or to bedew her sacred manes with religious tears this lesson had repentance taught his mind let no weak terrors for thyself withhold thy duteous steps or stop thy bountys course thy mother may

empty joy was flown while solid sense and comely reason and discretion fair supplied the place  ah unavailing all to chase his fears beneath a deep disguise he veiled each trace of what he once appeared lest when he saw were such his happy lot his aged parent strong surprise might seize her palsied nerves and nature quit her hold the dwelling once familiar to his foot with trembling hasty step he seeks  each eye each passing glance alarms him seems to cleave his wounded soul and lay each thinking bare the threshold gained while yet his shaking hand begged for admittance prone he fell  oerspent and to the kind inhabitants appeared a breathless corse  with charitable care they raised him up and by appliance meet quickened the pulse and bade it flow anew revived and of his proper course informed o blessings on each kindlytemperd heart that thus relieves the stranger on he hastens to seek while every conscious fear returned a mothers presence she her earliest meal dispatched

stretch of hope showrd on her age and with one pious wish for edwards virtue and return concluded her daily orison for now her mind by time made pliant had received the stamp of that great necessary means of happiness submission to her fate  thus flowed her hours tranquil and smooth as glides the summer lake if chance a sudden sigh a while deformed her sweet serenity of soul twas slight and momentary as the passing breeze for pure religion cannot long desert her willing votaries but repairs the grace with added luster as returning suns dispel the transient gloom and bid the stream again be smooth and clear nigh where she sat was passiontorturd edward doomed to pass big with a thousand various apprehensions these words alarmed his ear and if he yet survives o be he worthy of thy care it is all i beg he turned him to the sound and saw  what long he stopped not to survey but on the pinions of distraction flew knelt and embraced and wept upon a mother struck with affright  and who art thou she cried that thus  when as he pressed her trembling knee with couchant face all bathed in drops of shame a scar which boyish negligence had thrown broad over his neck awoke remembrance in her too strong to bear  scarce had she power to say art thou indeed my long  lost joy a sigh which shook and all unnervd her aged frame burst forth and on the favorite seat she dropped swift to his duteous care the youth arose and o forgive my desperate haste he cried forgive my zeal my eagerness of love i meant at leisure to disclose myself but nature would not let me  motionless she still remained and have i thus destroyed the only means of bliss forbid it heaven the dearest purpose of my life then ran and called aloud for aid himself unfit unknowing how to act forth from the portal horatio anna and domestics burst alarmed and haste instinctively to save their mansions honor from the neighboring spring they draw the happy means once more her eye beamed on the day though faint it strayed around with timid glance till on her edwards face it rested full then from the seat she sprung as if returning youth new strung her nerves and in her joy triumphant cried behold him more than i dared to ask is now bestowed  i have a son again then eager plunged into his clasping arms and there remained till fainting nature had repaired her strength resolving all her burden into tears that sacred dew which heaven in mercy gave to loads of anguish or excess of joy the assistant crowd stand speechless  motionless  and in each others eye alternate seek and read the cause of their amaze till edward his pious mother having sought relief on the same seat where late she lifeless lay from passions which too exqui itely pressed her shattered frame ran frantic in his joy to anna to horatio over and over he seized them and in wildness of embrace seemed to devour their loves on every visage well as he could he cast a look  when lo against a mourning cypress philip old leaned to support his weight of joy  a man of more than fourscore years  whom edwards father from infancy had reared their tempers customs and sentiments alike  hence counselor not steward was he called  often had he given advice clear just and wholesome to our youth when early joys and mad pursuits seduced him which when he found neglected and despised frequent he raised a bitter sigh and said my good old master happy happy thou whom the dark tomb enclosed ere this thou saw soon as the eye of edward caught his form and owned his reverend locks confusion stopped the purport of his tongue his heart was full but on his knee dropped sudden he breathed forth from fervent heart a thousand thousand blessings silent though not ineloquent he longed to ask how he had weathered out the storm of want and sorrow which the elder reading in his enquiring eye thus spoke  i live to see thy face once more thou comely copy of my old master know that righteous power who saw my truth and gratitude to him raised me another guardian in horatio since thy departure by his bounty fed i have seen thy fathers virtues all renewed his grace as well as love of doing good and lived over life again my joys so full by this last gift what have i now to do but bless my god and die  to live to live exclaimed the youth and see an altered man then rose and clasped him  more he would have said when a kind summons from their host who late retired with his domestics and prepared the genial board while anna tended duteous on her maria warned them in  he turned and helped to raise a mother  she supported on either hand betwixt her children moved not meanly proud of two such props now one now eyed the other and with graceful joy entered the house old philip followed weeping around the social board profusely spread raptured they take their several seats but short and tasteless was the meal fond recollection how long they hopeless languishd for so dear an interview subdued even natures claim of sweet refreshment incoherent phrase short sighs and interchange of softest looks that teemed with all the fullness of affection supplied the place while now the genial glass crown of the meal went round their honest host extravagantly glad contrived new joys to grace the coming time bade night descend copious in mirth with all that musics power or festive dance could add to cheer the soul and make the hours look gay thus far abroad his fancy flew for fresh and rare delights to form a life of bliss  when edward thus  dear by each tie of infant friendship dear by generous love and soul beneficent who have with pious care relieved and cheered hearts dearer than my own  i know not how to speak my gratitude  yet oh permit that for one night the revel be suspended and let oh let the present hours attest my

approaching scene  for now the portal capacious stretched to admit a wretched throng called from the adjacent town wellknown to those who steer direct over  s furzeblown heath with pious care and speed and each sad object encountered on the way by various woes and various wants reduced to drag with pain a living death  each ghastly form was there that poverty from out her rueful cave herself could draw to hurt the eye of man and wound the pitying breast  decrepid age bent underneath its load  sad widowhood with sunken eye and deep entrenched feature pined inly  tender orphan eyes were washed in early drops  and sorrowing fathers mourned their infants by the gripe of meagre famine snatched newly lo beneath the sacred roof no eye no hand no heart was unemployd all all united in the virtuous task to chase distress or bid affliction smile and saw their fair endeavors well repaid age bloomed afresh  here widowed breasts were cheered and sung with gratitude  there children wiped their eyes and fed transported edward seemed on every side at once from every object drew new delight  of food and alms his largess so quick so copious that the ravished taker was scant of power to catch the liberal blessing ere fallen to earth then took the goblet large and to the thirsty soul gave draughts of bliss immeasurable while the rest apart new stores accumulate therewith completing such sacred rites as here and there the youth through fervent duty and religious haste lest needy eyes should tarry long see ecclesiastieus chap iv had left unfinished thus employed before him stood unseen till now a terrifying form within the haggard face distracted fear and writhing pain and agonizing grief had struck their talons deep the bushy locks with crimson streams were clotted and upreard from hollow eye looked forth reproachful sorrow and damped the pious joy so newly born in edwards heart his glow of blood forsook his cheek while cold and clammy over his brow big drops were spread his nerves unstrung the cup fell from his feeble grasp a statue he of wild amazement while within his ears almost the only sense which now remained these heartastounding accents hideous rung not for myself do i approach thee youth or beg thy charity  but for a wife and two poor children who for more than twelve long years have lingered out their days in want while strength was theirs they eat the hardearnd morsel and drank the passing stream now deadly sickness so sore oppresses them scarce can they raise their wornout limbs from earth oh if thou have one crime which more than all the rest sits heavy within thy breast and hopst at thy last hour that crime should be forgiven  follow me as by a power from heaven impelled the youth flew forth and followed by horatios eye alone observed who traced his frantic steps which till they reached the venerable relics of an old ruined convent rested not there westward of the gloomy grove which gave a distant solemn prospect to the pile beneath the mouldering fabrics aweful height the form which thus had drawn the affrighted youth darting an eye of rigor cried redress and vanished from his sight  awhile he stood as one just wakened from a trance and rolled his eye balls wildly round big with surprise and horror  till horatio sorealarmd lest smote by frenzy strange imperial reason were from her throne removed seized quick his hand assaying to recall his sense  in vain  eager and loud he cries where is he speak i could not be deceived  my eye  my heart in dreadful sympathy acknowledged him the wound was fresh again the fatal gash how wide it yawnd for vengeance the red stream again it boiled and with unrighteous stain crimsoned the golden locks  redress thee  ay or may my woes never cease the hand that smote this moment shall revenge thee from his gripe no quick nor easy task horatio wrenchd and threw the desperate weapon far  then forced the enfeebld victim of despair to press the ragged flint while he by every art that friendship could suggest by look by speech by prayer and pious tears assayed to calm the tempest in his mind full well he saw some power superior far to idle fancy assailed the shattered brain from edwards eye at length burst forth a sympathetic flood and in disjointed accents thus he spoke thou shouldst not be a stranger here  forgive forgive a man just sunk in misery but i will atone it  yes beloved horatio fast as my heart permits i will tell thee all know then the dreadful cause to mortal breast yet unreveald and by thy truth thy love thy hope of future blessings i conjure thee from every other ear preserve it close of my removal from my native shore my friends  my duty  then when boiling youth ran madly through my veins too well thou know the fatal time was this oh guilt  i tremble to give it uttrance  know i carried with me a conscience black with murder  have thou ear for more or shall i stop  one fatal eve the sun as now had just retired afraid to view the deed with rash and coward hand swilld hot with wine and fired by frantic rage at some slight word i smote a surly hind smote him  and life was gone  i fondly hoped that penitence which deep within my heart poured its soft balm had cured the rankling sore and bade my mind be still my hope was vain it is not for me to know repose even now the form was with me nay it lived it looked it spoke  exact the same with that my memory bears and will ever bear  what might this mean calls it not loud for vengeance should i not submit me willing to the law and pay the price of blood with blood  nay speak in mercy silent and fixed they sat and pious grief with pious grief engaged their levelled eyes smote and transfixed each other  soul with soul conversed and speech was useless when a yell of woe which cleft alike their ears and hearts awoke them  round the ruined walls which long retained and to each other rattled shrill the piercing sound they trembling seek the cause it is found within a clammy claybuilt hut  which for support clung to the solemn stone with sticks and straws oerlaid whose scant enclosure received each gust of the ever shifting wind yielded to every falling flint and drank each drenching shower  a form with pallid want and misery overspread lay stretched on earth and seemed as in that moment life had left her wretched mansion of attire so bare twas miserys sad emblem  edward knelt  and while his heart ran over with pity raised the dying frame  then clasped within his bosom to kindle warmth and sooth back wandering breath supplying thus with charitable care the sacred task of two enfeebled children who in their slender arms had long sustained that load of anguish but worn out at last despoiled of all their strength perforce they gave their burden to the ground and in that cry of mad despair instinctive seemed to ask from heaven that aid they could no longer give with dubious aspect edward eyes his charge now thinks a faintish flush betints the cheek now seems the lid with weak assay to court a ray of light and now within the bosom deep seems the struggling breath to sob  but all so short and so imperfect that his hopes die ere they well are born just then horatio who in that very moment when the scene first met his eye on mercys wings had flown to the next neighboring cottage came supplied with food and cordial bevrage wholesome wines such as the birch or cowslips yellow leaf yields to the dextrous housewifes art  oerjoyd edward beholds and with united care between them they support the famished wretch dealing with prudent not with niggard hand scanty and slow relief by soft degrees soliciting the coy return of life during their task o man how graceful thou in such beseeming offices engaged the elder girl on whom some fourteen years had set their goodly mark thus answered sweet horatios earnest questions it is indeed my mother sir my good my loving mother who from the little that her labor earned gave us the largest share  stinting herself to feed her children  illness now has long made her unfit to labor and the bounty of charitable passengers has been our only means of living oftentimes when in the height of poverty and pain i have heard her wish to die and say her heart was dead long long ago and weeping sore has often related all the dismal cause  that when she went with child and was far gone of my young sister sir who stands beside you there is but two years between us one sad night expecting my poor father to his supper from evening work he was brought to her murdered his head and face all over blood  by whom it was done she never knew the friends at once from burning cheeks and fireemitting eyes flashed wonder on each other edward starting forgot his charge and to a place remote flew to assuage the fullness of his mind now the tough father of the bounteous cot whence good horatio brought the timely food the evening duties of his farm discharged returning with the guardian of his door his honest mastiff seeks his homely board with natures plain and wholesome diet crowned where with his wife his children and domestics he wont to share the social hour to hear the waggish joke and join the shout of mirth or with delight repeat their labors past retread their paths along the pasture sair remount the sloping hill review with glee through fancys magic glass the rising grain and thus in natures honest feelings pay the god of harvest not unwelcome praise scarce was horatio gone when he arrived  horatio lord of every flowery lawn each fertile mead and deepembowring grove for many miles around  horatio friend to the distressed and father of the poor the tenants pride and favorite from his dame the toiling rustic learns the strange event the place the pressing cause  deserts his meal and hour of mirth and with his jolly sons three sturdy sunburnd lads goes forth in haste to seek the presence of his muchloved lord and proffer honest aid in home spun phrase weak nature now in some degree repaired and vital sense and quickening warmth restored to them horatio glad resigns his charge entreating with religious care their home might take the strangers in and feed their wants till he resumed the task then seeks his friend around the venerable walls  where fixed and silent he surprises him with hands still clasped though fallen and heavnward swelling eyes that teemed with holy wonder  gracious god was all the raptured man could say horatio wistful how much he felt with meek dport engaged his arm then with assuasive speech strengthened by reason born of righteous zeal poured balm into his soul as he beguiled his wayward steps to seek their friendly home it is as thy soul divines  nay seek no more that wretched form  all thy fond soul could ask to gratify the present wish is done  harbor and rest and peaceful bread is here is from her own mouth when power of speech at last though weak returned i gained unerring proofs with temper hear and as thou hearst adore the wonderworking hand for such i deem it which led thee through the maze of this great day then to thy adoration join with me this firm belief that from thy life alone redress is claimed  nor dare by impious act of fell despair reduce thy date of years but patient wait till providence demands thee oh see the psalms tarry thou his leisure if aright i judge and not presumptuous be it held he has not cast thee off nor holds thy deed thofoul inexpiable  he regards with mercys eye i trust the erring hand of youth and rage  and sees thy heart explored no love of guilt no black intention there what voice but his could call why interrupt the pious office which engaged thy soul does it not seem to say  behold i show a greater duty far a nearer claim upon thy charity which undischargd the rest avail thee lightiy oh pursue the wondrous track obey the great command and all may yet be well thou best of friends edward returned with softened heart and speech and eyes that melted in affections dew thy breath is comfort to my heart thy words with all convictions force assail my sense to this great duty will i dedicate my future hours and leave the rest to heaven and if he has not wholly cast me off nor holds my crime though foul inexpiable may i when i neglect this earthly task his purposed mercy forseit mild discourse thus sooths and cheers their hearts reciprocal till in their sight the dear abode appears where the forsaken family surmising some distant act of goodness called the friends with grace united forth completed well the righteous work at home and ere they sent the guests rejoicing forth surcharged with stores they blessed the day and bade its due return with annual rites of charity be hallowed edward unsuited now to any converse but that of his own mind requests his friend to gloze his absence with some fair excuse and to his chamber calm and clear retires the chamber gained with care and anxious haste the door he closed forbidding even a breath of transient air should interrupt his thought beside his couch in zeal precipitate plunging upon his knees almighty father if yet by that dear name i dare invoke thee beam from thy throne of mercy one kind ray of comfort on my breast and teach my heart how in my conduct i may best atone my former guilt and in my hours to come deserve thy gracious care  to all that may find favor in thy sight far as i know i here devote me  every morn and eve my heart shall duly seek thee  duly praise thy wondrous power beneficence and mercy no day unmarked by charity shall pass but chief the unhappy whom my fatal hand by one dire act oh pardon pardon pardon made poor and widowed  she shall never know a care while life remains if i have power to chase it from her breast  my fortunes stream shall flow unbounded over her wants and feed her withered heart with plenty  to her children i will be another father in my love and if thy goodness oh my god permit a length of days for this my pious purpose my gratitude shall bless thee if denied rightwilling i submit  in every thing be praised thy justice and thy will be done hearteasd he rose then to his pillow quick repairs and coming night whose thickened gloom he wont not to behold without dismay reluctant horror each alarm of soul that apprehension breeds in conscious guilt with earnest suit he now invokes in sleep to shed relief on his much harrassd sense his suit was heard and sleep on downy plumes descending soft envelopd all the man when to his mental eye the very phantom which all so late disturbed his inmost soul once more appeared but clad in other guise in the late haggard face distracted fear and writhing pain and agonizing grief no more were seen no more the bushy locks with crimson drops were clotted and upreard each placid feature seemed by gentle peace becalmed and satisfactions sweetest smile beamed lovely soft content in meek array dwelt on the brow and decent lay the locks so mild the form tranquillity therein seemed to have fixed her residence entire immovable eternal  thus it spoke while drops of comfort from each sacred breath melted on edwards heart as kindly dews from heaven descending soft on newborn flowers repentant soul sleep now a quiet sleep my prayer is heard my wishes are accomplished thou now have made a full redress  awake to care and grief no more henceforth be guilt and pain and sorrow strangers to thy breast but peace with all her train inhabit there and pleasure strew thy paths through mortal life safe be thy course and long smooth be the bed of death and fairest gleams of opening bliss shine on thy parting spirit since refentance in neverfailing streams has washed away the stains of guilt and well thou have discharged thy debt to justice charity and god so spoke the form benign nor seemed to leave the blessed couch till morn with rosy hand expanded full the golden gates of light refreshed and full of gladness edward rose first wafted grateful praise with holy zeal then sought in haste his friend and over and over revolved and repossessd the vision fair with wonder and delight each greeting eye he met with transport new the name of son he long enjoyed and from that hour awoke to care and grief no more thenceforth were guilt and pain and sorrow strangers to his breast peace with her lovely train resided there and pleasure strewn his paths through mortal life safe was his course and long smooth was the bed of death and fairest gleams of opening bliss shone on his parting spirit  for repentance in neverfailing streams had washed away the stains of guilt and well he had discharged his debt to justice charity and god the end
