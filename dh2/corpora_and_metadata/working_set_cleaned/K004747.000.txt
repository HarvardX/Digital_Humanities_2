the family physician being a collection of useful family remedies  together with plain and full directions for administering them and properly nursing the sick where the advice of a physician is difficult to be procured  to which is added a short account of those cases in which bleeding and blisters are really serviceable  by hugh smith apothecary at the chemical warehouse the upper end of cheapside leading into newgatestreet london where the medicines herein recommended are faithfully prepared in boxes convenient for families to take into the country and for those who use the sea to take on shipboard  the third edition with additions  london printed in the year mdcclxi  price one shilling  preface the intention of the following sheets is to direct a right use of those medicines which are necessary to be kept in families whose distance from a good practitioner or any other circumstance renders an immediate application in sudden illnesses almost impossible and occasions those delays in trifling complaints which oftentimes prove of very bad consequence it has been found by experience for want of proper hints and directions in respect to the doses of medicines several fatal errors have been committed either from the ignorance of persons themselves or from being obliged to have recourse for want of better to the advice of nurses and such good women whose greatest skill extends to the making a posset for a sweat or a plaster for a sore shin  those captains of ships whose vessels are too small to allow of carrying a surgeon and gentlemen whose business may call them to take a long voyage in such small vessels or to travel by land through unfrequented or poor places or those who are going to settle in any of his majestys plantations will find a great advantage from being thus enabled to become their own physicians in cases of necessity and we often see that nature with a little assistance will free the constitution from disorders which are not too deeply rooted or very malignant in the first attack i would by no means be understood to pretend that the medicines i here recommend are infallible in the respective disorders they are prescribed for being for the most part such only as are to be found in the dispensatory of the college of physicians where i have been under a necessity of compounding i have attended to the practice of the principal physicians in town and assume no further merit to myself than to care of selecting such medicines whose operations are the least dangerous thus far however i will venture to assert that by following these directions which are plain and easy and wrote in a style fitted to the meanest capacity perspicuity being always preferable to elegance in this kind of writing the patient may by applying what is necessary in time prevent those ills that follow from neglect which good nursing and a few innocent things might at first remove  those who have a knowledge in physic and do not stand in need of my assistance will in the boxes find many useful medicines to be kept at hand and may extend their practice by giving me a catalogue of such others as they would choose to have added  ladies and gentlemen who reside in the country will hereby be enabled to assist their poor neighbors which many of them i doubt not would take a pleasure in doing did they but know what to apply  with each box of medicines may be had a box of scales and weights each weight marked distinctly that any person may at once adjust the proper quantity for a dose  as many people may choose to keep by them what is proper for their own particular complaints whom it may not suit to have the box complete i think it necessary to mention that any of the medicines here recommended may be had separate or as many of them as agreeable packed up in lesser boxes for the convenience of carriage  n b ladies closets are also fitted up with the choicest drugs medicines and cordials by  their obedient very humble servant hugh smith  weights used in prescription a pound containing twelve ounces an ounce containing eight drams a dram containing three scruples a scruple containing twenty grains the family physician asthmatic tincture this tincture is of use in a difficulty of breathing tightness across the breast and short coughs particularly if brought on by cold northeasterly winds which frequently affect the breast sides and lungs it allays the cough opens the chest and loosens the phlegm so that it easily comes away and frees the pores of the skin which have been shut up by the winds  it may be taken as often as occasion requires from thirty to sixty or eighty drops in a little see page    pectoral drink or barley water with which you should dilute plentifully drinking it of the same heat as you would a dish of tea  astringent electary never be too hasty in the use of this electary it is often found that a purging is the means made use of by nature to carry off other complaints or to free the body from bad humors which might in time beget disorders now by stopping this wholesome drain too soon these bad humors may be thrown back into the blood and produce the worst consequences therefore you will seldom or never err by suffering the purging if not over violent to continue two or three days at the end of that time should you find the patient weakened by it or that it is really a disorder itself and not a cure for other disorders then you may give a dose or two of rhubarb and afterward proceed to the use of the electary by these means you will cleanse the stomach and bowels and get rid of the complaint without any farther trouble  fluxes which seafaring people are subject to are to be treated much in the same manner but be very careful to cleanse the bowels first  some of my friends who have been many years accustomed to the sea recommend the sea p    purging apozem before the use of astringents they say it cools the body and carries off every thing which is disagreeable to the bowels better than rhubarb or any other purge after having cleansed the stomach and bowels of the filth which occasioned the disorder by the one or other of these means you will find ipecacuanha given with the astringent electary in very small quantities viz from half a grain to one or two grains of infinite service but this should be practiced only by those who have some little knowledge in physic and they will have the satisfaction to find the method here recommended will seldom if ever fail of success  its dose above    years  from   scruples to   dram between   and     from   scruple to   scruples between   and    from  0 grains to  0 grains under three years old decrease the quantity in proportion  this may be given once in six or eight hours or night and morning as the case requires either swallowed whole or dissolved in a little hartshorn drink  remember beer should be forbid and see hartshorn and gum p  0 hartshorn drink supply the place of other small liquors rice gruel is a proper food  should this or any other of the electaries grow dry they may be softened with a little syrup or a spoonful of white wine  balsamic electary is good in all tickling coughs soreness at the breast inward bruises and such like complaints  the quantity of a nutmeg may be taken night and morning and once or twice in the day besides with a large draught of pectoral drink made hot after it  if costive take a little of the opening electary or a few spoonfuls of the purging apozem as you judge most proper  bark the febrifuge quality of this bark and its peculiar efficacy in curing intermittent fevers is now universally known yet a two hasty use of it oftentimes proves prejudicial a a remittent fever is when at certain periods the fever is more violent than at others but the patient never entirely free from it remittent or continual fever being the consequence you will seldom or never err by giving a vomit first and if the sick be of a full habit of body you may also purge with safety you will act more prudently by waiting till they have had four or five ague fits before you throw in the bark giving a salt of wormwood see p    draught once in six or eight hours which will make the fits more regular and prepare the blood for the bark you should begin when the fever is gone entirely off and give at least one ounce before you expect it to return in low fenny countries where the atmosphere is moist and foggy it is sometimes necessary to give one ounce and a half of bark between the fits but in general an ounce is sufficient  half a dram two scruples or a dram may be given for a dose as the stomach will bear it the less you administer at a time the more frequent it must be repeated for unless you get the whole quantity down within the time you do nothing  the fit being put by a second ounce should be taken in the like small doses within the three following days at the distance of about six or eight hours the patient may now rest six days unless signs of the agues return require the bark to be repeated sooner when a third ounce is to be taken in like manner a dose every six or eight hours another week being elapsed a fourth ounce is also to be administered when you may take your leave of them and be pretty well assured they will not be subject to a return  the common mixture to give it in may be made of three quarters of a pint of spring water and a quarter of a pint of good french brandy sweetened with a bit of sugar a teacupful of which should be taken with each dose mix the powder in a little of it and drink the remainder after it  if it purges which is oftentimes the case it should be given in a little cinnamon tea should that not answer two three or four drops of laudanum must be added to each dose  if on the contrary the bark should bind a few grains of rhubarb may be given with each dose as long as you see necessary  above the age of fourteen it will require this quantity to cure the ague under these years your judgment must direct you to decrease it the manner of giving it must be exactly the same we frequently and with success for children and those of dellcate constitutions boil the bark a long while in water and give the strained liquor instead of the powder in substance the proportion is an ounce in two or three pints of water till you can pour off one  sometimes when the season is unfavourable you may meet with cases which do not entirely give way to this treatment if so let them continue the following a fortnight or three weeks afterward  bark wine take of bark grossly powdered two ounces the yellow peel of two seville oranges and one nutmeg grated pour three pints of old rough red port upon these ingredients let them stand by a gentle fire in a large bottle for three or four days shaking it frequently then pour off a wineglassful of the clear liquor at the time you take it which should be morning noon and night when you have taken one half another pint of wine may be added and kept upon the ingredients till the whole is taken at least for ten days or a fortnight a few drops of elixir of vitriol two or three times a day with the wine or mixed in a glass of water may be also serviceable  barley water take two tablespoonfuls of pearl barley wash it and boil it in half a pint of water for two or three minutes pour away this water which will be colored and add about three pints of boiling water let it simmer till one pint is consumed this is a common and good drink in fevers and every other complaint when a soft diluting liquor is advisable  colic mixture this mixture is warm and comfortable to the stomach and bowels somewhat opening proper in colic complaints and for the wind particularly if after meals it is likewise serviceable for pains in the stomach  two or three tablespoonfuls may be taken at a time  but if the pain is very violent and stools are much wanting give of the purging apozem freely or the opening electary  if there are too many stools first give a little rhubarb then use the astringent electary which see  diachylon plaster the use of this plaster is well known in slight cuts or other little accidents it should be spread with a warm knife upon a piece of fine rag or an old glove  diuretic mixture this mixture is good in all gravelly complaints and for the dropsy heat of urine pains in the loins and stoppage of water one large spoonful or two upon an emergency may be given for a dose every six or eight hours or night and morning as the case requires mixed in half a pint of marshmallow drink if you can procure it if not barley water but observe if the pain is violent you will do right first to give the purging apozem to promote stools and let them drink plentifully of thin water gruel which will cleanse the bowels and urinary passages and greatly assist the intention of this mixture remember the body should always be kept open and those who are subject to these complaints should accustom themselves to drink very plentifully of small liquors at all times by small liquors i would be understood to mean any liquor between water and twelve shilling table beer  which will often of themselves perform a perfect cure  elixir of vitriol this is esteemed good to strengthen the stomach and bowels to create an appetite and brace up the solids  its dose above    years  from  0 to  0 drops between   and     from  0 to  0 under that age  from   to   or   it may be given in a little water or wine and water but where the patient can be brought to take it a cup of chamomile tea is preferable to any other liquid whatever  the proper times for taking it are in a morning fasting an hour before dinner and two hours after dinner  when joined with the tincture of bark it will be found to add considerably to the efficacy of that noble medicine  fever powder when the skin is hot and parched the tongue white and other common signs of a fever which every one is acquainted with such as thirst weariness etc put them to bed and give a dose of the fever powder every six or eight hours let them drink freely of pectoral drink barley water or the like small liquors to dilute the blood and encourage a breathing sweat if you find them mend under this management and the fever to disappear in a day or two before you quit them give the purging apozem which will secure their health and add to your reputation when they are young and very full of blood and the pulse throbbing with great violence it is a strong indication to bleed to satisfy you more particularly in this point refer to the article bleeding  it will be frequently necessary under the above symptoms particularly if costive to give the purging apozem before the powder thereby you cleanse the bowels and cool the body but here your observation can alone direct you  its dose above    years  from    to  0 grains between   and     from   to  0 between   and    from   to    within the months as your judgment directs  on the contrary should the disorder not give way unless you have some knowledge in physic it will be most prudent if you can have advice to commit them to the care of some gentleman of the faculty as you may conclude it is that kind of fever which will not yield to this simple method  should i attempt to describe the various kinds of fevers it would only puzzle the unskilful therefore the above directions are sufficient for those who stand in need of any assistance to enable them frequently to render service and prevent their ever doing any injury  fit drops for children these drops are very good against fits in general for grown persons as well as children but they are particularly serviceable to the latter more especially in those fits which attend the cutting their teeth  from three to ten drops may be given for a dose to children under twelve months old above that age increase the number as you think fit grown people may take a large teaspoonful for a dose  they may be given in black cherry water or any other liquor and repeated as often as necessity requires  fryars balsam is applied to fresh wounds and is esteemed good to stop bleeding be careful not to use it to old sores as it frequently proves prejudicial  it is given internally from ten to sixty drops in a little powdered sugar or a glass of water in inward decays bleedings or bruises also in coughs and hoarseness  gascoigns powder the reputation of this powder so long established renders it almost unnecessary to say any thing about its efficacy its use among children is very common to correct gripings prevent acidities and remove little feverish heats it is frequently and with great propriety joined with a few grains of rhubarb  a child within the month may take from   to   grains  between   and    months  from   to   between   and   years  from   to    those who are more advanced in life from  0 to  0  it may be taken every six or eight hours us you see necessary  gargle for sore throats take half a pint of pectoral drink two spoonfuls of virgin honey and a like quantity of the best white wine vinegar let the throat be gargled frequently with this as hot as you can bear it if the glands are much swelled so as to render it difficult to swallow and the patient is very hot and feverish with a full quick pulse refer to the article bleeding and give the purging apozem to open the body three or four times then let him take the fever powder and dilute very plentifully with pectoral drink or the like  if on the contrary there is a small fluttering pulse sometimes rather quick with specks in the throat and it looks discolored give wine and cordial things  glaubers salts this salt is seldom taken alone except by common people who cannot afford to join manna with it which not only makes it more palatable but prevents the roughness of its operation  from ten years old its dose is from half an ounce to one ounce with an equal quantity of manna some people add a double quantity of manna dissolved in a little water water gruel or sena tea but the best form is the purging apozem which see  hartshorn drops are given in faintings and esteemed good to thin the blood its known use renders a more minute detail unnecessary  the dose is from ten to sixty drops in any liquid you please  hartshorn and gum pour three pints of water on each paper of hartshorn and gum let it boil till you can strain off a quart which should be poured through piece of a fine rag or a lawn sieve just before you take it from the fire you may add a crust of bread and a bit of cinnamon if agreeable it may be sweetened to your palate this is the proper drink to be used in common for purgings after a little rhubarb or something of that kind has been given  heartburn lozenges one of them may be kept in the mouth as often as agreeable if costive a few grains of rhubarb should be taken or a little magnesia alba  hiera picra is a warm physic good for disorders in the stomach and particularly in female complaints  its dose from one table spoonful to four at bed time or in a morning  hysteric mixture this mixture may be taken from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful which is the proper dose for a grown person in any hysterical complaint it should be mixed with a little water or with a cup of hysteric and pennyroyal water being too strong to take alone  jaundice electary where it has not been preceded by the colic nor is attended with a fever or bleedings it is most likely to proceed from a sluggish viscid bile in which case the cure is easy and may be effected in the following manner the symptoms every one knows are a yellowness of the skin and upon the whites of the eyes highcolored urine and white stools an inactivity weariness oppression of the spirits and loss of appetite  first give a gentle vomit of ipecacuanha the following morning let them be purged four or five times with the purging apozem which should be repeated every fourth or fifth day on the intermediate days of purging give them the quantity of a nutmeg of this electary night and morning with a salt of wormwood draught after it let them dilute plentifully with lemonade and live upon light food this method will quickly restore their color strength and spirits  ipecacuanha is a gentle vomit and may where there is occasion be safely given to children i am afraid it is in general rather overdosed whereby the patient is sometimes injured by straining more violently than their stomach and constitution will bear i am convinced from experience that a few grains will operate on many people far better than large doses the best way of administering it to children and indeed to every body is to give three four five or six grains mixed in a little water or chamomile tea and if it does not take effect in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour repeat the same quantity this method will certainly prevent the bad consequences sometimes attending violent vomits and make the operation more easy and pleasant  let them drink thin water gruel chamomile tea or the like to work it off  for the itch an ointment made of one third part of flowers of sulphur and two thirds hogslard rubbed in night and morning where it appears is a safe and certain cure though perhaps not so expeditious as mercurial preparations but they have no place here i have not put up any thing for the itch and some other complaints that need no immediate assistance or require more experience than the generality of my readers are acquainted with such as the small pox measles etc in which the constitution and symptoms must vary the practice particular medicines in these complaints setting the almost impossibility of giving clear directions aside would swell the box too large and answer little or no end my greatest care through the whole being to prevent mischief in improperly administering medicines and i should be fearful in these cases the bold unskilful practitioner might oftentimes be puzzled to the detriment of his patient and those who are capable of rendering service will find medicines in the box to answer their intention in most disorders   laudanum i have directed the use of this with the bark a few drops may also be joined with the astringent electary if the purging is obstinate and does not readily give way it is likewise proper in many other cases but i would not have the unexperienced be too free with it therefore shall say no more  magnesia alba is a medicine strongly recommended by many writers particularly for young children  it corrects acidities in the stomach more powerfully than chalk oystershells pearls coral crabs eyes or the like testaceous powders and joined to this it has a gentle purgative property and is the only one of an alkaline nature at present made use of it is also serviceable in the heartburn  it may be given to children from twenty grains to a dram or even two drams in a day a little at a time mixed in their food grown people may take it more freely  manna is a gentle purge which affects only the stomach and bowels it is in much esteem for children and given from one or two drams to one ounce grown people may take one ounce and a half or two ounces without stirring them for which reason it is quickened with glaubers salts which see  marshmallow drink take a quarter of a pound of marshmallow roots washed very clean and boil them in three quarts of water until one is consumed remove it from the fire and when cold decant off the liquor if you do not think the thickness disagreeable it will be more efficacious by pressing the roots it may be sweetened with virgin honey this may be drank at pleasure and is recommended in all cases where a soft lubricating regimen is proper it is much esteemed for the gravel and heat of urine  nervous tincture nervous complaints are too common in england to need a particular description in all kinds of them this tincture is very serviceable it is likewise proper in lowness of spirits faintings and hysterical cases giving strength and cheerfulness and raising the depressed spirits the dose is from one to two teaspoonfuls two or three times a day in a glass of wine and water or valerian tea  oil of roses this is an excellent outward remedy for all parts in a state of inflammation especially when attended with great pain in which case it is also proper to refer to bleeding and the purging apozem  the method of applying it is by rubbing it in with a warm hand  oily emulsion take four large spoonfuls of oil of almonds half a pint of cold barley water two drams of fine sugar in powder and sixty drops of spirit of hartshorn shake them well together and the whole immediately becomes a white emulsion two spoonfuls of cinnamon water being added will make it very palatable  it is good in stitches and pleuritic pains in the side and breast hoarseness coughs etc  a teacupful may be taken frequently  opening electary this electary gently relaxes the belly without causing sickness or gripings which quick purges are apt to do  when intended only to open the body for a grown person the dose is the quantity of a nutmeg at bedtime if designed to purge more brisk repeat the dose in the morning  it may be given to children in a proportionably less degree and proves a good physic particularly where they are troubled with phlegm  if more agreeable in a liquid form you may dissolve it in a small quantity of any weak drink  opodeldoc is very serviceable in bruises or strains it should be rubbed in with the warm hand three or four times a day  palsy drops in all cases where a heaviness hangs upon the spirits with a drowsiness dizziness or swimming of the head these drops are equally serviceable as in the palsy all these complaints proceeding from the same bad disposition of the blood  the dose is from one to two tea spoonfuls two or three times a day in a glass of wine and water or valerian tea  paralytic or palsyliniment this liniment is good in all paralytic complaints likewise where a stiffness and numbness remain after the rheumatism it will remove those acute rheumatic pains which seize the limbs on taking cold and oftentimes proves a cure for the sciatica or hip gout its warm stimulating quality puts the part rubbed with it into a glow frees the pores of the skin and by quickening the circulation removes those obstructions which were the cause of pain  it should be applied night and morning with a warm hand if before the fire the better and the part afterward covered with a piece of warm flannel where the disorder does not give way let the palsy drops be taken also  pectoral drink take two tablespoonfuls of pearl barley boil it two or three minutes in half a pint of water pour away that water and add a quart and half a pint of fresh water to the barley let it boil ten minutes then add twenty stoned raisins and one fig cut into slices also a bit of stick liquorice as long as your finger let these boil together a few minutes and strain off a quart of the pectoral drink  this is an agreeable soft liquor good in any case where the intention is to dilute but more especially in coughs colds oppressions of the breast and such like complaints  pile electary take the quantity of a nutmeg of this electary night and morning so as to keep the body gently open avoid pepper and all heating things little or no wine should be drank and your food must be of the lighter and vegitable kind  pile liniment if the piles are external apply a little of this liniment upon a piece of fine rag very frequently which will cool the part and procure ease setting over the steam of warm water is frequently serviceable especially if an handful or two of marshmallow leaves and a little bran be added  powder for sweats ineed not point out the particular circumstances in which this is necessary every one being sensible how much it is of service in colds achs and pains in the bones and the like complaints  its dose above the age of     from  0 to  0 grains between   and    years  from  0 to  0  under seven years old decrease the quantity as your judgment directs let it be taken at bedtime with a large draught of white wine whey or something of that kind and if very hard to sweat twenty or thirty drops of spirits of hartshorn or sal volatile in it but observe if there is any fever the fever powder is most proper  purging apozem pour a pint of boiling water upon one ounce of glaubers salts one ounce of manna and one dram of bruised caraway seeds stir them a little to dissolve the manna and salts cover the vessel and let it stand to cool you may if you please add a little slice of seville orange peel to the above  this is the best method i know of disguising the salts and making them sit easy upon the stomach  of the strained liquor a draught may be taken in the morning and repeated once in half an hour or an hour as the stomach will bear it till it purges sufficiently the age of the person must be considered and as you know the strength of the apozem it will be easy to adjust the dose  if intended only to relax the body a few spoonfuls taken at bedtime or in the morning will have the desired effect  a less quantity may at any time be prepared as you find occasion for it  quick purging powder in many cases such as dropsical and gross habits of body foulness of stomach when a vomit is sometimes previously to be taken and for people of strong constitutions who live much upon a flesh diet and salt provisions where you think manna and salts are not powerful enough and even to younger persons whom you want to purge very briskly this purging powder is recommended and may be given in a little of any liquor  its dose above the age of     from    grains to   scruples between   and     from    grains to half a dram between   and    from   grains to   scruple  rheumatic powder this powder may be given night and morning from one to two scruples with twenty or thirty drops of sal volatile in white wine whey sage tea i must not omit noticing an egregious and common error in making these herb teas for a sick person that is the putting such a large quantity of leaves and stalks into a pot and letting water stand upon it three or four hours which is the general method used by nurses and attendants it not only makes the drink nauseous but in many inflammatory cases it proves very prejudicial for instead of being the cooling draught which is advisable it is become so hot by the pungency of the herbs that it absolutely adds fuel to the fire put from  0 to  0 leaves according to the strength of different herbs into a pot and pour upon them a quart of boiling water after standing three or four minutes just as you manage your green tea pour it out into a basin to cool by this means you have the fine flavor of the plant and i am convinced many people will find herbs which our own climate produces such as sage mint balm ground ivy etc thus properly managed produce a more grateful liquor than that tea so commonly used in england and for which we pay so extravagant a price or any small liquor  the dose should be increased or diminished so as to keep the body open if the pains are very violent and the pores of the skin shut up by preceding colds let the paralytic liniment be used  rhubarb powder all physicians agree in the excellency of this root it is a good purge in many complaints and strengthens the stomach and bowels it is particularly recommended for children more especially for the worms as it purges off those crudities in which they breed  its dose above    years  from    to  0 grains between   and     from  0 to  0 grains between   and    from   to    grains within the months  from   to   grains  salop is of late years brought into much esteem in england it is of a restorative and strengthening quality salop like most other things for which there is a large demand to enable the trader to sell cheap is very frequently much adulterated i am afraid the greatest part of what is commonly sold for powder of salop will be found to have in it a considerable quantity of starch and gum arabic which ought to put people upon their guard where they purchase it for although the virtues of the true are undeniable the adulterated must fall short of its excellency and the false in appearance if artfully managed will deceive very good judges  many ladies whom i have had the honor to recommend it to of tender constitutions where tea has been found to prey overmuch upon a week stomach and where more nourishment has been necessary than they received from their ordinary food eat it in a morning for breakfast and i must confess it would much please me to see it more universally received particularly by those who are subject to nervous complaints being in its own nature very strengthening easy of digestion and in the manner here recommended affords a great deal of nourishment in an impoverished state of blood therefore the properest food that can be received after a severe fit of sickness whereby the patint is much weakened  the common way of preparing it is with water and a glass of wine added to it but the method i think far preferable is this  boil half a pint of milk with as much water while it is in a boiling state let two teaspoonfuls of the powder of salop first mixed in a basin with a spoonful or two of cold water be thrown into it after it has simmered a minute or two stirring it the while you will find the whole of a smooth creamy consistence a bit of sugar and a little nutmeg may be added to make it palatable those whom milk is apt to render costive should mix the salop with the water alone as above directed and add the milk to it after it is taken from the fire  we all know how serviceable a milk diet is in many cases by this method it will agree with them upon whose stomach it otherways turns sour and curdles  salt of wormwood draught take a scruple of salt of wormwood pour upon it by little and little fresh lemon juice till it has done fermenting and tastes quite insipid about one large spoonful is sufficient then add a little fine sugar to make it palatable about a wineglass of spring or barley water and a papspoonful of cinnamon water makes a most pleasant draught  above the age of fourteen it may be given once in six or eight hours in any little feverish complaints sickness at stomach watchings parched dryness of the mouth and suchlike ills and is often preferable to the fever powder from seven to fourteen years half a draught is sufficient under that age still decrease the quantity  sal volatile the use of these drops is so common and well known for raising the spirits that i need only take notice of its dose which is from ten to sixty drops in a glass of water or what you please  scorbutic elixir this preparation is in an especial manner devoted to the relief of scorbutic disorders it is of a scouring nature breaks and divides all obstructions of the glands proceeding from a more than ordinary thickness of the blood and by restoring the mass to a due state of fluidity prevents those feverish dispositions which naturally arise from any hindrance in the necessary secretions such as urine stool etc it is a great promoter of urine and a great quickener of the motions of the fluids it may be likewise serviceable in an unwieldy habit from sluggish humors and help to throw off a dropsy from fifteen drops to two teaspoonfuls may betaken to or three times a day in a draught of sage tea or any other liquor and continued for some time  sena tea the usual method of preparing this is by putting as much of the sena leaves as your thumb and two fingers will contain into a teapot and pouring upon it a gill of boiling water when cold pour out the liquor which will be strong enough to give a grown person a stool or two  a little manna and salts may be dissolved in this sena tea which makes it operate brisker  snuff for the headache this snuff may be safely used in all complaints of the head it is prepared from herbs which have a particular efficacy in those cases as is manifest from the infinite service received from it in old and settled pains of the head  it may be taken as freely as you please  sperma ceti bolus take of sperma ceti one scruple of fever powder ten grains make these into a bolus with a sufficient quantity of syrup to be taken once in six or eight hours with a little pennyroyal and hysteric water in lying in cases and miscarriages in either of which where the pains are violent you may add three four or five drops of laudanum to each bolus remember also to prevent costiveness either by gentle clysters a little sena tea or some other mild purgative  sperma ceti emulsion take two drams of the powder of sperma ceti rub it in a marble mortar with a quarter part of the yolk of one egg till it is a smooth pulp then add two drams of fine sugar in powder mix them well together and by little and little pour on half a pint of cold barley water strain it through a fine hair or coarse lawn sieve which will keep back the undissolved part of the sperma ceti and render the emulsion smooth and even to the whole you may add two spoonfuls of cinnamon water  a wineglass may be taken as often as agreeable in coughs hoarseness when troubled with phlegm or any of the like complaints also in the hooping cough when if they are feverish you should join a little fever powder with it and purge them with rhubarb or the quick purging powder once in four or five days you may likewise give the stomach tincture between breakfast and dinner and between dinner and supper gentle vomits are oftentimes also serviceable  sperma ceti and sugar candy this may be taken at pleasure when troubled with a cough or hoarseness difficulty of breathing or with phlegm it is often of some service and so innocent it can do no harm even to young children  spirit of lavender is used in lowness of spirits as a cordial it is also given in faintings and pains in the head and may be taken frequently from ten to sixty drops on a lump of sugar in wine and water or any other liquor  steel electary in female obstructions this electary may be given from half a dram to one dram night and morning in the form of a bolus or made into pills as is most agreeable drinking a cup of cold chamomile flower tea or a little pennyroyal and hysteric water if you have reason to think physic is proper give a dose of hiera picra at bedtime let the feet be bathed in warm water for ten minutes then wipe them very dry and if the weather is cold wrap them up in a piece of flannel  stomach tincture this tincture is highly proper in a weakness of the stomach loss of appetite or bad digestion as a bitter it frequently contributes to the destroying of worms and not only excites the sense of hunger but by its warm aromatic property at the same time that it gives a grateful sensation strengthens the coats of the stomach which by any cause may have been weakened and renders it more able to break and digest the food taken in for the nourishment of the body  the dose for a grown person is from one to two teaspoonfuls an hour before dinner and three hours after dinner in a glass of water those who are accustomed to drink wine may add an equal quantity to the water  when given to children for the worms it should be taken the first thing in the morning and last at bedtime in a little water or chamomile flower tea  a child of seven years old may take a teaspoonful for a dose under that age decrease the quantity as your judgment directs  if you have reason to imagine the stomach is foul let a gentle puke of ipecacuanha be taken before the use of this tincture  if inclined to be costive now and then at bedtime take a dose of the opening electary or a few grains of rhubarb  strengthening plaster a piece of this plaster may be applied in any wrench or strain weakness of the loins or other parts  to make a syrup dissolve a pound of sugar in half a pint of water over a gentle fire in an earthen pipkin let it simmer one minute or two take off the scum and preserve the syrup which is proper to soften the electaries when they grow dry to make up pills or bolusses and to give children their powders in  tincture of bark this is serviceable in many complaints in weak and relaxed habits of body flushings and hectic heats it checks profuse sweats and braces up the solids it is highly proper in all kinds of bleedings but more efficacious when joined with a fourth part of elixir of vitriol  it may be given on any emergency when taken for a constancy the proper hours are the same as for elixir of vitriol which see  the dose is from one to two teaspoonfuls in any liquor  tooth powder for the scurvy in the gums this powder eleanses and preserves the teeth and gums takes off scales and all kind of filth without injuring the enamel which gritty powders are apt to do  it should be used with a piece of sponge every thing which is hard or rough being prejudicial as they destroy the enamel when the teeth must necessarily decay  turners cerate is commonly used for burns cuts scalds bruises chilblains and other little complaints where the skin is worn off and is so well known i need not be more particular  valerian root is of late years come into great esteem in all nervous disorders of the bruised root they make a tea in the same manner as sena tea and drink it three or four times a day which is a proper thing to take the nervous tincture in being of itself i am afraid not effectual as the quantity of the root given in this manner or in the tincture prepared from it is too trifling to have any great dependence upon  valerian root in powder if you intend to reap benefit from it you must take it in pretty large quantities it is usually given from half a dram to one dram in a little liquor of any kind and should be repeated once in six or eight hours  yellow basilicon is made use of in cases which require more discharge than the turners cerate will promote but in a great measure applied for the same intention  worm powder this powder should be taken the very first thing early in the morning and the last at bedtime at least one hour after supper mixed in a little honey current jelly or somewhat of the like nature and where it is not a spoiled child let a cupful of cold camomile tea or water with a teaspoonful of the stomach tincture be drank after it this will keep them open nevertheless in most cases you should purge once in four or five days for very young children rhubarb is proper should that not prove strong enough the quick purging powder may be given but where they are older and will take it cleanse their bowels with the purging apozem  its dose above    years  from    grains to   scruples between   and     from   scruple to half a dram between   and    from    grains to   scruple between   and    from   to    grains on bleeding irather choose to mention the complaints in which bleeding is advisable under this general head than with the medicines for the respective disorders because it may naturally be supposed they cannot always procure the assistance for which reason directing to bleed before the use of the medicines in cases where it might prove serviceable may be a means of preventing their administering those remedies which taken in time will frequently alone remove the complaints besides i would not wish the unskilful to be too free with the lancet as an injudicious evacuation of blood may be succeeded with very bad consequences and my intention through the whole as i observed in the preface being no other than to supply families with a few useful remedies for slight indispositions by which they may frequently prevent tedious illnesses but not to put the unexperienced upon trifling with themselves when they are really ill and can have proper advice  blood should be taken away in the beginning of fevers when there is a strong quick pulse the eyes red and fiery with great heat and thirst but never when they are in the decline as from being inflammatory they are often at this period degenerated into the nevous kind when the chief of the affair is to be managed by the frequent application of blisters  in asthmatical complaints if the patient be of a full habit of body  in coughs if the pulse is quick and full with an oppression at the breast or difficulty in breathing  in colics where the pain is violent the bowels inflamed and no stools  in fits if the spirits are hurried and overpowered and the patient full of blood  in swimmings dizziness and pains of the head  in stitches and pleuritic disorders of the side and breast particularly if it gives pain to take a deep breath  in sore throats where there is a strong quick pulse and the throat greatly swelled and inflamed  for the piles it is sometimes serviceable as likewise in female obstructions and frequently in rheumatic complaints in apoplectic disorders a dysentery or bloody flux and irksome heat of the bowels for the hooping cough particularly if of a full habit of body and the phlegm which is brought up appears streaked with blood in all of which cases the quantity taken away must be proportioned to the age of the patient and the violence of the complaint  bleeding again ought to be directed in large abscesses or swellings where the heat and pain is immoderate for in these cases by drawing blood the matter is more easily and speedily brought to ripen and by that means the body more effectually freed from its distempers  in a word wherever prevail sore eyes sciatica or hip gout a dry husky cough an headache pains of the womb or of the bladder dry gripes strangury gravel pain from the stone violent bleedings of the nose ears or other parts an inveterate scorbutical itch and the like opening a vein is of peculiar service but in dropsies a jaundice the gout and all illnesses occasioned by a relaxed state of body an impoverished blood or too great weakness of the vessels you must seek relief from the medicines recommended in this little manual and not by an abrupt and preposterous use of bleeding increase the disorder and ruin the health of the patient and your own reputation  on the application of blisters to the cautions here laid down with respect to bleeding i shall add a word or two concerning the application of blisters  the most excellent remedy may be prostituted by an inconsiderate rash and foolish practice which it is plain oftentimes happens with regard to blisters by ordering them indiscriminately in all severs and without distinction in any time of the distemper which can only be the effect of ignorance  therefore before we resolve on an expedient of this nature it would be convenient to consider whether the fever be of the inflammatory or nervous kind if of the former instead of blistering the lancet ought to be used and a mild cooling regimen set on soot as already directed this will moderate the heat of the blood and by degrees restore it to its due temper on the other hand in fevers of the nervous class where the symptoms are quite different the pulse being low and weak the spirits almost spent and the eyes instead of appearing sparkling red and fiery grown quite dim we ought by all means to make use of blisters and that freely  they are oftentimes proper in paralytic and nervous complaints as likewise in rheumatic pains and pleurisies in which cases a blister applied immediately upon the part affected frequently affords great relief and and in a variety of other cases they are of infinite service but then regard must be paid to the state of the patients blood for if a full quick pulse great heat thirst and the other symptoms of an inflammatory fever attend upon the disorders the fever must first be conquered and afterward if necessity requires it let blisters be applied should they cause a strangury which will sometimes be the case give the patient plentifully of marshmallow drink or barley water with a little gum arabic dissolved in it or if there is a purging which you would wish to be stopped of the hartshorn drink and this inconvenience will soon be remedied  in regard to the management of them the plaster should be spread upon a piece of an old glove and bound on to the part intended after twentyfour hours the strength of the flies being pretty well spent you may remove the blister and if you cannot procure the proper dressings a little turners cerate spread upon a piece of fine rag may supply its place  should any blisters appear unbroke snip them with a pair of scissars if they give violent pain this may be done when the plaster has been applied only twelve hours when by discharging the water and laying it smooth on again you ease the patient and give the blister an opportunity of acting more  index a ague  see bark page   bark wine   acidities at the stomach see
