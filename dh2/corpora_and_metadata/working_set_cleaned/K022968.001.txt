additions to the works of alexander pope esquire  entered in the hall book of the company of stationers  additions to the works of alexander pope esquire  together with many original poems and letters of cotemporary writers never before published  in two volumes  vol i   foliis tantum ne carmina manda ne turbata volent rapidis ludibria ventis virgil  pulverem olympicum collegisse juvat hor  london printed for h baldwin t longman r baldwin g robinson t caslon g kearsly and j ridley       preface however sparing modern authors are in giving due praise to their cotemporaries they seem to be more united in acknowledging the merit of those who to use the language of the psalmist have ceased from their labors writers whose works have stood the test of years have acquired a kind of prescriptive title to celebrity not on account of that superior wisdom which is often attributed to times we have survived or the supposed degeneracy of the present but because what has been long known has been more reflected upon and what undergoes this examination is better understood  in the catalogue of authors whose writings have met with public reception none have been more justly celebrated than those of pope and his cotemporaries insomuch that their names have not only been honorably recorded but the period in which they lived has been preeminently distinguished by the title of the augustan age other points of time have here and there given birth to a great genius who like a leading star has enlightened the horizon of literature but no particular era at least of our history has produced so general and collected a light as this a light which at once shone upon every part of science at the same time that it illuminated the circle of morality  what could have been the cause why such a cluster of great men flourished at the same period of time and why we have had no similar succession ever since whether the first arose from the emulation of authorship which like the collision of hard bodies struck a fire from each other or that the latter was occasioned by the number of finished pieces they gave to the world which has ever since occasioned a kind of literary satiety is a question perhaps not so readily decided this however is as generally known as assented to that from the very few eminent geniuses who have arisen since the flourishing days of this illustrious junto nature seems to have indulged herself in a temporary repose  when authors therefore have thus long engaged the public attention when their works are read with avidity and universally receive a classical stamp those who can add any thing to their illustration and recover by time what has eluded former diligence bring an acceptable present to the public it is with good authors as with good men the nearer and more intimately they are viewed the more we are able to set a proper value upon their characters and look up to them as more enforcing examples of imitation and instruction  under this idea the editor thinks he need make no apology in presenting the public with two additional volumes to the works of mr pope which contain such of that celebrated bards pieces in prose and verse together with many of his cotemporaries as for particular and local reasons were then suppressed might have been mislaid or perhaps got into too remote hands to be collected with ease he is aware at the same time that the public rage for the remains of celebrated men has occasioned many spurious productions being fathered on them under the wellknown titles of second parts and posthumous works our best authors and principally our best have been subject to such impositions which though they have been in time detected have yet answered the illiberal purposes of such a temporary publication the editor of the present work to get clear of the shadow of an imputation in this line is the first to remind the public that several of the pieces here exhibited originally appeared in the st jamess chronicle  the favorable reception they met with in that fugitive mode of publication first suggested to him a wish to give them a more durable form he accordingly communicated this wish to his friends who assisted him in his design so much beyond his expectation that instead of one volume his original intention he has by their favor been able to make out two composed of such materials as he flatters himself will acquit him of the charge of an hasty or selfinterested compiler  many of the letters and poems of which this publication consists were transcribed with accuracy from the originals in the collections of the late lords oxford and bolingbroke who are well known to have lived in the strictest intimacy with mr pope as well as his literary friends and associates some of the latter will be found no way inferior to other productions of the same authors all of the fragments more or less carry the marks of a master others of the letters are taken from pamphlets printed some years ago which in the detached manner they then appeared will it is to be hoped fully justify their present mode of publication they for the most part treat of critical friendly humorous and literary subjects and abstracted from these throw new lights upon the character of mr pope as a man  his letters to his favorite miss blount lead to the support of a charge often urged against him  his want of original invention for though the extent of his erudition and his elegant turn of thinking gave him a superiority to all his cotemporaries in polishing to a degree of originality other peoples sentiments yet here whether from the carelessness arising from intimate friendship idleness or the supposition of his not being detected by his fair correspondent he has committed a plagiarism on voiture which would be unworthy a much less celebrated pen than his  his letter to jabez hughes esquire brother to the author of the siege of damascus with that of his to mr dennis the critic are melancholy proofs that the greatest genius cannot always shield men from duplicity of conduct in their literary characters and bring another corroboration to the testimony of gays assertion that wits are gamecocks to each other but if these letters show the weaknesses perhaps the inseparable weaknesses from human nature others will show some of its fairest and brightest sides they will exhibit the strongest traits of his humanity and friendship his wit his learning and his morals they will confirm his more than roman affection to his parents and particularly to his aged mother whose life he watched over with such soothing solicitude and exemplary reverence as force us for a while to turn from the luster of his talents to admire the superiority of his silial character  a few poems and letters will be found in this collection which appeared only in some of the editions of his works in none of them quite perfect which are particularly distinguished in the latter by the additional paragraphs being printed in italics this will justify their republication here more particularly as many of them are written in that unreserved open manner which his original editor might have a wish to conceal for many reasons that now no longer remain at present the restoration of them can neither indulge vanity nor gratify spleen they may be read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure and are therefore only to be praised as that object is obtained  to many in an age like this where hypocrisy in morals is much practiced as is shown by our dramatic and other writers perhaps a few of the poems may appear too loose and descriptive particularly the farewell to london the conclusion of the address to miss blount on leaving town and some passages in the sober advice from horace etc by mr pope together with the poem called virtue in danger and others by lady mary wortley montague but on a proper examination this charge of indecency will be found to lie more in the readers turn of thinking than the defects of the writer a poet who wants to give his subject due force should comply with the rules of his profession by using proper words in proper places and provided he keeps a steady eye on the moral of his piece the more he colors from nature the more he assists his design whilst the hint and double entendrez those mock draperies of delicacy often create a more indecent meaning than the circumstance will allow and urge the young and inexperienced reader more to the exercise of his passions than his reason  swifts delicacy has been often arraigned on the same principle and his ladys dressing room and others of his poems of a similar stamp are ever sure to be adduced as convincing proofs of this charge but where is the woman of real sense and cleanliness offended at it conscious she deserves no such reprehension in her own conduct she sees the general force of the satire only directed to the slatterns of her sex and is pleased with the hope of a consequent reformation in short the editor is entirely of opinion that the same rule respecting decency which a modern artist has laid down in painting will equally hold good in poetry  it is not in showing or concealing the naked that modesty or lewdness depend they arise entirely from the choice and intentions of the artist himself a great mind can raise great or pleasing ideas though he shows all the parts of the body in their natural way whilst the cheapside prints of the buck and quaker girl the charms of the garter and highwind are proofs that very lewd ideas might be produced though little or nothing of the naked be discovered and there is no doubt but that the venus de medicis might be converted into a very lewd figure by dressing her out for that purpose barry on the arts   the letters which passed between mr pope and his booksellers which are to be found in the second of these volumes may appear to those who are to be no otherwise pleased with human genius than seeing it eternally on the stretch rather too trisling and as the public voice is not a little raised upon like occasions the editor thinks it may be necessary to say something on this subject  it is objected that most of our great writers no sooner establish a reputation for their works but there are never wanting interested people who preferring a private lucre either to the fame of the author or national honor busy themselves in gleaning up their most uninteresting thoughts on the most uninteresting subjects such as letters to tradesmen etc and that kind of domestic correspondence which to use the language of a modern author a wise man should be ashamed to remember  was a collection of this kind purposely made for the filling up a volume without the least regard to amusement curiosity or instruction it must soon defeat its own purposes for however common readers may for a while be pleased with the novelty the reprobation it must receive from men of sense would soon distinguish it as the mortal part of an author and in this state consign it to oblivion but trifling as these letters appear to be many of them referring to literary business help to settle dates and explain references which perhaps before were not quite so intelligible and like those well digested questions on a legal examination which however simple they may appear in respect to their immediate enquiries are yet important as they strengthen or elucidate a fact in their connections others will serve to show the degree of intimacy between the poet and bookseller of that time the process of publication and many other little anecdotes of parties and places too trifling to be otherwise recorded but by this mode of preservation and yet too curious at least to literary enquirers to fall down the stream of obscurity  the editor having now made those apologies which he thought necessary for offering these volumes to the public he will no longer detain them from the exercise of their own judgment he cannot however conclude without assuring them that his design in this compilation was no more than to collect in one view such pieces of our celebrated english bard and his cotemporaries as may be lost to the world from a fugitive mode of publication and others which might be equally lost from their being only open to the inspection of the few in this as he has spared no industry or expense himself and stands much indebted to the researches and interest of many of his friends he hopes to have the merit of a faithful and useful compiler and that these volumes may not

human life  sapientia prima est stultitia caruisse  hor the preface of all kinds of poetry the didascalic is the most valuable if aiming at the good of mankind be what justly entitles any thing to that character the descriptive kind is like a fine landscape where you meet with two or three principal figures the rest is all rocks rivulets hanging woods and verdant lawns amusing to the eye showing the taste of the painter but carrying little instruction along with it but the didascalic is like a curious piece of history painting where every figure must be highly wrought every passion strongly represented all contributing in their several degrees to express the main design in short it must be a finished piece  that this is a very difficult work may be collected from the small number of those poets who have ever attempted it in the early ages of the grecians i remember none who have wrote any thing in this way but old hesiod aratus and nicander for dionysius the periegetic and agesilaus oppians father was a man of great learning and merit as well as wealth and power in the city of anazarbus in cilicia where he lived severus making a progress came to that town and agesilaus being not at the procession to meet the emperor at his entrance probably on account of his age and infirmities that prince to punish him for so heinous a crime banished the poor old man to malta oppian to amuse his father under his misfortune took to writing of poetry and afterward dedicated his halieutics to the emperors son the emperor was so pleased with the poem that he ordered him a piece of gold for each line and offered him any other favor he would ask the first part of the story is not at all wonderful but i must confess the last part is a little surprising oppian lived not till the time of the roman emperors hesiods works and days is the only piece remaining that is allowed to be genuine without dispute but by virgils and especially maniliuss compliments to him it is highly probable he wrote others and perhaps more valuable ones though quintilian allows him the palma in illo medio genere dicendi only and le fevre is much more hard upon him when he makes him little better than an almanackmaker and his work a mean performance paterculus and plutarch set him next to homer as well in the value of his works as in the period of his age says mr kennet but perhaps that may be the other extreme aratus wrote a poem in two books which he calls the phenomenon and diosemeia the one astronomical giving an account of the situation and the affection of the heavenly bodies the other astrological showing the particular influences arising from their various dispositions and relations kennets lives of the greek poets  tully commends him for his versification and quintilian says he has fully answered his argument which put together should make up a pretty good character as to nicander vossius places him amongst his greek historians but allows him to have been egregius grammaticus poeta and medicus his surviving works are however only poetry upon poisons and the methods of cure for them of the two latter greek poets dionysius and oppian the one wrote a survey of the world and the other cynegetics and halieutics in both which it is certain there are very fine parts however judgments may differ about them  amongst the romans lucretius and manilius may justly be said to be the chief of the didascalic poets they both wrote with all the fire of their youth about em for neither of them lived to be old i have always fancied manilius imitated lucretius in his manner the beginning of his books being pretty much in the same way besides that he loses no occasion of launching out into descriptions and is florid to a fault he has likewise some reflections the beginning of the fourth book on the follies of men so very much of a piece with what you meet with in the  th book of lucretius that one would almost think them taken from thence in general it may be said they are both very noble poems though that of manilius is far from being finished as it might have been if the author had lived what errors are to be found in the philosophy of the one and the astronomy of the other are owing perhaps as much to the age of the world at that time as their own and their beauties may in some measure atone for their faults  virgils georgics are in the same kind though the subjects are of less dignity and i dont know whether i might not likewise add ovid on the account of his fasti the most correct of all his works gratius too about the same time wrote his cynegetics which are very justly esteemed  amongst the moderns fracastoriuss syphilis quillets callipaedia and vidas art of poetry are the best poems of this sort rapin of gardens and vaniers praedium rusticum are not without their merit but much inferior to the others in our own language too we have some poems of this instructive kind the essays on poetry translated verse and criticism are fine instances of the worth and excellency of this manner of writing to which may be very truly applied what dr young says of satyr  heroes and gods make other poems fine  plain satyr calls for sense in every line universal passion sat ii  the strength of just observations conveyed in smooth and flowing numbers has a prevailing influence insinuates itself into the mind almost imperceptibly and makes a more lasting impression there than one would easily imagine it is true these subjects are purely critical and so of less consequence to mankind in general but yet polishing the understanding improving the judgment and regulating the taste are far from being things indifferent to the world since they tend not a little to the shaming out of it that rusticity and barbarism those follies and affectations in one word all that littleness of mind which is so effectual a bar in the way of generous and noble undertakings but we have had of late an undeniable proof that the finest and most useful sort of philosophy which consists in the knowledge of ourselves may be conveyed in such clear strong easy and affecting strains at the same time convincing and captivating the understanding that there remains no doubt but that poetry in the hands of a great genius may be made as beneficial as ever it has been entertaining to mankind the latter effect is indeed what has been generally most aimed at as it is compassed with less difficulty to the writer and meets with a more universal reception amongst the common sort of readers  nec in turbam nec turbae carmina condam manil l ii imagery fine coloring and bright antitheses often disguise the want of justness and force and by pleasing the imagination do as it were steal away from the judgment or sometimes impose upon it as shadows pass for substances with weak distempered or fanciful men  the os magna sonaturum of horace would make one almost think the muse must never appear without her buskins and that all simplicity of expression were to be totally banished out of poetical writings it is true the epic poem the ode and the tragedy very often require and consequently justify the use of elevated language as it may be more suitable to the greatness of the subjects and better fitted to raise the several passions they are designed to work upon but where the appeal lies only to the understanding selfevident truths naturally and beautifully expressed can never fail of the approbation of a sound head and a good taste and even horace himself as elevated and great a poet as he must be allowed in his odes appears to much more advantage in his sermones and epistles where as my lord roscommon observes on another occasion  fancy labors less but judgment more   sir john denhams coopers hill has met with universal applause though its subject seems rather descriptive than instructing but it is not the hill the river nor the stag chase it is the good sense and the fine reflections so frequently interspersed and as it were interwoven with the rest that gives it the value and will make it as was said of true wit everlasting like the sun  the late mr priors solomon seems to have cost him much time and pains and was i believe his favorite performance he is in some doubt whether to call it a didascalic or heroic poem it has indeed something of both and yet strictly speaking is perfectly neither it has not fable machinery nor variety enough to be an heroic poem and it is too diffusive and luxuriant in the style too florid and full of descriptions to be of the didascalic sort in general it may be justly said to be a very fine piece though i must confess i cannot help giving the preference to his alma in which the design is more closely pursued carried on with more spirit and never loses your attention  upon the whole what mr dryden has said in the preface to his religio laici is i think very true the expressions of a poem designed purely for instruction ought to be plain and natural and yet majestic for here the poet is presumed to be a kind of lawgiver and those three qualities which i have named are proper to the legislative style the florid elevated and figurative way is for the passions for love and hatred fear and anger are begotten in the soul by showing their objects out of their true proportion either greater than the life or less but instruction is to be given by showing them what they naturally are a man is to be cheated into passion but to be reasoned into truth  the following short piece may be perhaps a little too pompously introduced by the foregoing observations all i shall say for it is i endeavored to follow mr drydens rules how far i have succeeded i can be no proper judge myself but whatever may be said of the poetry and about that i am very indifferent the sentiments must surely be allowed to be just and good and i am entirely of mr priors opinion i had rather be thought a good englishman which is but another word for an honest man than the best poet or greatest scholar that ever wrote  an essay on human life the essay on human life was printed soon after the essay on man was ushered into the world by the same publisher and asserted in the title to be written by the same author this circumstance was never contradicted by mr pope the hint for the performance was probably taken from dr swifts letter july         where he observes  from these volumes of letters might be collected the best system that ever was wrote for the conduct of human life  as to the other poems they speak for themselves and as they were universally acknowledged to be mr popes at their first appearance they will not we presume be disputed now    by mr pope pleasure but cheats us with an empty name still seems to vary yet is still the same amusements all its utmost skill can boast by use it lessens and in thought is lost the youth that riots and the age that hoards folly that sacrifices things to words pride wit and beauty in one taste agree it is sensual or it is mental luxury sad state of nature doomed to fruitless pain something to wish and want but never gain restless we live and disappointed die unhappy though we know not how nor why reason perhaps may lend her generous aid reason which never yet her trust betrayed let her direct us in the doubtful strife let her conduct us through the maze of life is human reason then from weakness free partakes she not of our infirmity can she apply with neverfailing art the healing balsam to the wounded part correct those errors which the passions cause and teach the will to follow wisdoms laws alas experience but too plainly shows that man can act against the truths he knows by customs led or by allurements won discern that evil which he cannot shun whatever we do the motives much the same it is impulse governs under reasons name each eagerly some favorite end pursues and different tempers furnish different views is it for fear of wrong or love of right that statesmen labor or that warriors fight to enrich his country does the sailor brave the cruel pirate and the threatening wave in search of truth unwearied sages try by certain rules to fix uncertainty no it is desire and hope that drive them on thus greatest things for meanest ends are done selflove however disguised misunderstood however misplaced is still the sovereign good virtue or wisdom but the vain pretense these may direct but passions influence presumptuous man why boasts thou thy free will by constitution doomed to good or ill what feeble checks are all those studied rules unpracticed lessons of the useless schools say can thy art opposed to natures force obstruct her motions or suspend her course go change in africa their sable hue or make our europe bring her negroes too roll back the tides forbid the streams to flow nor let this earth returning seasons know slave to thyself whilst lord of all beside surmount thy weakness or renounce thy pride that moving power which first produced the whole to every thing has fixed a certain goal thither all tend and must their circles run for such the order when the whole begun to different creatures different ranks assigned man claims the first as of a nobler kind how just that claim what wisdom must decide reason is his alone by which it is tried inferior creatures silently submit it is his to talk and therefore to have wit thus haughty greece despised the world around and barbarous all she understood not found look over the wide creation see how all its several parts obey the makers call the earth how fertile and how rich the sea in various salts for natures chemistry slow air digests what burning suns exhale and dews and snows and rains by turns prevail beasts birds and reptiles see em all conspire to act whatever their several states require but wiser man disdains this meaner part nature with him must still give way to art vain of conceit he boasts his fancied skill and arbitrary rules the world at will now fierce and cruel then as mild and kind each action owing to each turn of mind one day a friend the next as great a foe as humor pique caprice or interests go wisdom and folly thus by turns preside and chance alone inclines to either side ask the bold freeman or the coward slave what makes one abject and the other brave what gives to sools their faith to knaves their wiles to cynicks fourness and to flattrers smiles this one great truth must stand by all confessed some ruling passion lurks in every breast that weakness by a specious name they call for it is that weakness still which governs all wisely the springs of action we conceal thus sordidness is prudence fury zeal ambition makes the public good her care and hypocrites the mask of saintship wear inured to falsehood we ourselves deceive often what we wish we fancy we believe we call that judgment which is only will and as we act we learn to argue ill like bigots who their various creeds desend by making reason still to system bend customs or interests govern all mankind some biass cleaves to the unguarded mind through this as in a false or flattering glass things seem to change their natures as they pass objects the same in different lights appear and but the colors which we give em wear error and fraud from this great source arise all fools are modish and all knaves are wise who does not boast some merit of his own though to himself perhaps it is only known each suits reward to his own favorite vice pride has its crowns and lust its paradise bonze priest and dervise all in this agree that heaven must be pomp or luxury man slave to sense no higher bliss can know still measures things above by things below joys much the same but differ in degree as time enlarged becomes eternity how vain is all that science we pursue scorned by the many useless to the few since short of truth our utmost labors end who knows but ignorance is our greatest friend the fruitless pains but show the weakness more and we like misers midst our wealth are poor much hoarded learning but like lumber lies or ends in guesswork and obscurities what though proud greece her seven sages boast the names alone remain the race is lost satyrs and centaurs too might live of old for so we are in ancient story told but should we doubt in this our faithless age who can produce a centaur or a sage such mighty births were natures first essays the lusty offspring of her youthful days our latter times can no such wonders show but what were giants then are pigmies now of all the painful follies of mankind still to be seeking what they never must find is sure the greatest not unlike the toil of him who labors in a barren soil beyond our state if our fond wishes tend means must be vain where we mistake the end pride whispers mighty projects in the ear bids us be great be wise be happy here but sad experience shows the laws of fate and teaches us to know ourselves too late error is a distemper of the mind hard to be cured because it is hard to find so mixed and blended with our very frame it lurks secure and borrows reasons name in different persons different ways it springs it is factiousness in subjects pride in kings boundless alike they in extremes agree these in oppression those in anarchy both aim at what twere ruin to obtain a civil phrenzy or a tyrant reign the wise must into natures secrets pry the weak believe they know not what nor why and we may equally deluded call who doubt of nothing as who doubt of all profane or pious bigotrys the same the motives terror avarice or fame opinion is but interest in disguise and right and wrong in strength of parties lies some would be happy know nor want nor care others still find more evils than there are whilst truth unheeded in the midway lies and all extremes are like absurdities wrong turns of head are natures greatest curse improving everyday from bad to worse in some odd light all objects still they view thus true with them is false and false is true in trifles solemn diligent and wise important things as trifles they despise caressing enemies their friends they shun and dote on knaves by whom they are undone deaf to advice or taking wrong for right they boldly blunder on in reasons spite and under clearer lights obscure pretense are the antipodes of common sense would you persuade a wretch intent on pelf though he starves others not to starve himself to sense at lead his sapless trunk from cold nor seem as fond of tatters as of gold no he is too cunning for your fly design you would have him like yourself be poor and fine but he in spite of envy richer grows and scorns the luxury of meat and clothes ask the ambitious why he wastes his life in needless struggles and uncertain strife why not in peace enjoy what plenty gives so the obscure the weak the lazy lives exalted spirits have a nobler aim and know no happiness but toil and fame well must it suit a selfish hollow heart to act the honest patriots generous part no tool of party nor no slave of state no mean dependant on the guilty great boldly he pleads for liberty and laws content to perish in his countrys cause when lo a ray divine of favor gleams quite different topics then become his themes old friends old notions are at once forgot and shame and wages are the hirelings lot the little mind whose joy in mischief lies hates all mankind but most the good and wise proud of his shame he boasts his spiteful skill and places all his worth in doing ill but baseborn fear often checks what rage devised and leaves him disappointed and despised endless the task to point the various ways how each wrong head its different gifts displays how poverty in boasts its wants would hide and meanness shows itself in awkward pride how knaves are cunning at their own expense and coxcombs fancy forwardness is sense vain is the attempt to be what heaven denies as vain the art that weakness to disguise prudence alone can teach the useful skill timprove the good and to correct the ill true wisdom lies in practice more than rules for what are maxims when applied to fools of wit and folly reason all you can who acts most wisely is the wisest man each state of life has its peculiar view alike in each there is a false and true this point to fix is reasons use and end on this success all other must depend but in this point no error can be small to deviate ever so little ruins all the mark once missed however near you aim missed by an inch or furlong it is the same who sets out wrong is more than half undone error has many ways and truth but one wrong estimates wrong conduct must produce they lose the blessing that mistake its use who value wealth or power but more or less as that can riot or as this oppress what say they else but that they both are given to execute the wrath of angry heaven fools ever vain at some distinction aim and fancy madness is the way to fame no matter how the deathless names acquired by countries ravaged or a erostratus a very obscure man set fire to the temple of diana at ephesus in order to immortalize his name and has succeeded in it in spite of all endeavors to the

then thy envied state to raise mens wonder and provoke their hate by crimes procured and then in fear enjoyed by mobs applauded and by mobs destroyed say mighty cunning which deserve the prize the courtiers promises or traders lies some shortlived profit all the pains rewards of bankrupt dealers and of perjured lords honest alike you own but wiser far the knave upon the bench than at the bar where lies the difference only in degree and higher rank is greater infamy poor rogues in chains but dangle to the wind whilst rich ones live the terror of mankind pomp power and riches all mere trifles are when purchased by the loss of character chance may the wise betray the brave defeat but they correct or are above their fate credit once lost can never be retrieved how few will trust the man who once deceived craft like the mole works only underground is lost in daylight and destroyed when found notions mistaken reasnings ill applied and sophisms that conclude on either side alike the

blaze and to the darkness owe their feeble rays the wise see diodorus siculus in the first book egyptians when their monarch died by truths sure standard all his actions tried when no false luster wealth or power appears to biass judgment by its hopes or fears then conquering chiefs profuse of subjects blood and lazy dotards indolently good that trust their people to a favrites care whose peaceful rapines cost them more than war by injured thousands wrongs are doomed to be perpetual marks of scorn and infamy fortune with fools and wit with knaves you find it is social virtue shows the

george ii when she was forbid to appear at court thursday feb           that the duchess of queensberry is surpised and well pleased that the king has given her so agreeable a command as to stay from court where she never came for diversion but to bestow a great civility upon the king and queen she hopes by such an unprecedented order as this that the king will see as few as he wishes at his court particularly such as dare think or speak the truth i dare not do otherwise and ought not nor could i have imagined that it would not have been the highest compliment that i could possibly pay the king to endeavor to support truth and innocence in his house  c queensberry particularly when the king and queen had both told me that they had not read mr gays play i have certainly done right then to stand to my own word rather than his grace of graftons who has neither made use of truth judgment or honor through this whole affair either for himself or his friends   what follows was written by her grace at the bottom of the copies of the above answer which she gave to her particular friends  this is the answer i gave in writing to the vice chamberlain to read to the king in answer to the message he brought me from the king to refrain coming to court  all the seven following copies of verses were written on the foregoing subject thy dull request my friend give over against that place i vow whence truth was long discharged before and beautys banished now on the forbidding command to the duchess of queensberry how blessed the court how loft the fair who is banished thence where all submit such is our prudent monarchs care to cibbers the mention of cibbers modesty is sufficiently authorized by the following particulars in the  th chapter of his apology etc after the vast success of that new species of poetry the beggars opera the year following i was so stupid as to attempt something of the same kind upon quite a different foundation that of recommending virtue and innocence etc this passage which is too long to be quoted here will show at once the cause of his enmity to gay and afford a specimen of his very singular modesty it will likewise illustrate the other pieces of poetry written on the same occasion  it may be observed that the middlesex justices have done mr cibber the honor to adopt his sentiments concerning the immorality of the beggars opera happy cibber   modesty and wit true wit can never want support where learned graftons the mecaenas and ladies must adore that court where ganymede takes place of venus boileau sat ix en vain contre le cid un ministre se ligue tout paris pour chimene a les yeux de rodrigue the same paraphrased in vain was ministerial breath in vain monarchic folly all eyes saw walpole in macheath and queensberry in polly to the duchess of queensberry let the knight sir robert walpole on beauty lower loveliest ornament of power let him at a stagers nod painted prostitute and proud hate to real charms display basely sworn to ruin gay happy gay ordained to know such a friend and such a foe what though wit and sense to love courtiers idle rage may move calmly you unhurt retreat banished by the vulgar great take your beauties thence away full revenge is to obey let the meaner rank and face borrow luster from the place there where friendship false beguiles basely murdering while it smiles there where proud despotic will boasts the power of doing ill there where paltry gold outvies all the luster of your eyes generous and just and fair why ah why should you be there to johnny gay the great ones justly johnny gay have damned thy second opera and to macheath refuse to give the favor of three days reprieve felons from transportation come are hanged forthwith when caught at home and robin swears he ought to swing for plundring but an indian king a ballad to the tune of lillibullero i says a friend to a knight shall a friend by whose skill all the houses are taught all their parts every day let lincolnsinnfields house do just what it will there is another macheath sir prohibit the play cibbers your friend a play he has penned this play was love in a riddle see cibbers apology for his life etc  in which there is nothing that can be applied for he does not mention the word bribe or pension nor any one vice that can fit you beside ii so macheath was forbid by authority good to cibber were sent many hands to applaud but in this house it seems men judged as they would not by promises swayed nor by promises awed harsh catcalls sound the hiss goes round the courtiers join hisses and give up the wight as in this house they show it they dare damn the poet who knows but in the other they will give up the knight iii but young sir william young who had likewise a hand in some operatical performances at this omen is nothing dismayed he would show to the town as twas certainly fit if broom floyd and room broom had been a menial servant to ben jonson he was the original author of the jovial crew which was afterward altered by mr room the son of our first undertaker and since by another hand concerning floyd even the dunciad is silent could come to his aid that the friends of the ministry might have some wit and so they took an old play book writ in ben jonsons time by his man master broom some speeches they mangled some songs intertangled sing the courtiers in praise of broom floyd and room iv it is said that this piece in good breeding so nice can never any gentlemans pleasure molest for they mention no modish no politic vice they censure no knaves nor make coxcombs a jest thus young and broom and floyd and room have learnt to be mannerly cautious and sage from gays newgate satire whose vulgar ill nature treated rich rogues and poor rogues alike on the stage v then sure we must own it was prudent and fit to stop our macheath in his second attack and cibber to set up against it for wit whom two pair of bards with a sequel should back twas floyd and broom and young and room clap your hands ye good courtiers and grin at this play in two days died cibber but young will go glibber and all these court poets be damned the first day written in mr gays works

great bard who can alike inspire with wallers softness or with miltons fire whilst i the meanest of the muses throng to thy just praises tune the adventurous song how am i filled with rapture and delight when gods and mortals mixed sustain the fight like milton then though in more polished strains thy chariots rattle over the smoking plains what though archangel against archangel arms and highest heaven resounds with dire alarms does not the reader with like dread survey the wounded gods repulsed with foul dismay but when some fair one guides your softer verse her charms her godlike

thy quick poetic eyes and view gay scenes and opening prospects rise hark how his rustic numbers charm around while groves to groves and hills to hills resound the listening beasts stand fearless as he sings and birds attentive close their useless wings the swains and satyrs trip it over the plain and think old spenser is revived again but when once more the godlike man begun in words smooth

undejected though declined not wondering at the worlds new wicked ways compared with those of our forefathers days for virtue now is neither more nor less and vice is only varied in her dress believe it men have ever been the same and ovids golden age is but a dream by lady mary wortley montague to lady irwin this poem has been already printed in dodsleys collection and is here reprinted for the sake of the answer which never appeared before in the original copy of the former the fourth stanza is wanting which we may suppose to have been afterward added by the authoress as in lady irwins reply there is none that corresponds with it  why will delia thus retire and languish life away while the sighing crowds admire it is too soon for hartshorn tea all these dismal looks and fretting cannot damons life restore long ago the worms have eat him you can never see him more once again consult your toilet in the glass your face review so much reading soon will spoil it and no spring your charms renew i like you was born a woman well i know what vapors mean the disease alas is common single we have all the spleen all the morals that they tell us never cured the sorrow yet choose among the pretty fellows one of humor youth and wit prithee hear him every morning for at least an hour or two once again at night returning i believe the dose will do the answer by lady irwin though delia often retires it is not from spleen or hate no lovers she desires nor envies others fate though her damons dead it is true yet he lives in delias heart none a constancy can show where a virtue has no part should she consult her toilet alas she will quickly find her face there is naught can spoil it so she will improve her mind if the morals that they tell us cannot cure us of despair i believe the pretty fellows will bring us only double care it is our interest then to shun em since their practice it is such they who venture boldly on em often find one dose too much an elegy on mrs bows mrs bows was the first wife of mr bows father to the present lady strathmore  by lady m w montague hail happy bride for thou art truly blessed three months of pleasure crowned with endless rest merit like yours was heavens peculiar care you loved  yet tasted happiness sincere the sweets of love to you were only shown the sure succeeding bitter dregs unknown you had not yet the fatal change deplored the tender lover for the imperious lord nor felt the pangs that jealous fondness brings nor wept the coldness from possession springs above your sex distinguished in your fate you trusted yet experienced no deceit swift were your hours and winged with pleasure flew no vain repentance gave a sigh to you and if superior bliss heaven can bestow with fellow angels you enjoy it now on lady mary wortley montagues verses on the death of mrs bows cloe her thoughts has so expressed each chosen word so justly put and yet how neat soever they are dressed we through the lawn may see the smut such lechery dressed up so clean and with so chaste a look is hardly to be felt or seen but under cloes sck the answer to lady marys verses on mrs bows though every one knows the fate of poor bows yet doctors about it do vary some make a sad face and pity her case it is the envy of good lady mary she says she dont know how heaven can bestow any joy like the death of that bride whence some people say could she choose her own way before now she had certainly died but here lies the mistake if her sense she would speak her meaning appears but too plain she would always be trying but to bows leaves the dying her choice is to live in the pain on a lady mistaking a dying trader for a dying lover by lady mary wortley montague on mrs lowther lord lonsdales sister as chloris on her downy pillow lay twixt sleep and wake the morning slid away soft at her chamber door a tap was heard she listened and again no one appeared who is there the sprightly nymph with courage cries madam it is one who for your laship dies sure it is delusion what a dying lover yet speak once more what is it you say discover a second time these accents pierced the air sweet was the sound transported was the fair at length mankind are just her laship said threw on her gown and stepping out of bed looked in her glass confessed him to be right  who thinks me not a beauty it is mere spite assemble ye coquets with envy frown to see the wonders that my eyes have done in vain your pert and forward airs you try mankind the more you court the farther fly and it is for me and only me they die but how shall i receive him cried the dame prudence allows not pity  i must blame perhaps poor soul he has sighed in secret long ere the presumptuous thought escaped his tongue i am the cause yet innocent by heaven  why were these eyes for such destruction given it is not my fault i did not make one feature  then turned her look to view the dying creature butah who should the enamored swain now prove  a wretch who dies by trade and not by love no mortal pen can figure her surprise willing to trust her ears but not her eyes the approaching storm her swelling bosom showed awhile now pale then red with anger glowed she wept she raved invoked the powers above who give no ear when old maids talk of love fruitless her prayers and impotent her rage yet sierce as when two female scolds engage at length the fire was spent all was serene a calm succeeded this tempestuous scene and thus she spoke ye blooming maids let my example prove how often your sex mistaken are in love when young we are cruel and with beauty play which while we vainly parley fades away when old to increase the rigor of our fate we wish and talk of lovers when too late as idle travelers who have lost the day and hope in night through shades to find the way forlorn they tread the thorny paths in vain not of themselves but their hard fate complain so peevish maids when past their youthful bloom on sad remains and fancied charms presume lonely they wander no companion find then rail and quarrel with all human kind but let us to ourselves for once be just and see our own decays and wrinkles first whenever to melting sighs we lend an ear think youth and beauty make the men sincere no other powers their stubborn hearts can move  did ever virtue light the torch of love from sad experience i this truth declare i am now abandoned though i once was fair virtue in danger a lamentable story how a virtuous lady had like to have been ravished by her sisters footman to the tune of the children in the wood by lady m w montague i now ponder well ye ladies fair these words that i shall write i will tell a tale shall make you stare of a poor ladys fright ii she laid her down all in her bed and soon began to snore it never came into her head to lock her chamber door iii a arthur gray footman of her sister dear a sturdy scot was he without a sense of godly fear bethought him wickedly iv thought he this lady lies alone i like her comely face it would most gallantly be done her body to embrace v in order to this bold attempt he ran up stairs apace while this poor lady nothing dreamt or dreamt it was his grace vi the candle flaring in her eyes made her full soon awake he scorned to do it by surprise or her a sleeping take vii a sword he had and it hard by a thing appeared withal which we for very modesty a pistol choose to call viii this pistol in one hand he took and thus began to woo her  lord how this tender creature shook when he presented to her ix lady quoth he i must obtain  for i have loved you long would you know how my heart you gained you had it for a song x resolve to quench my present flame or you must murdered be it was those pretty eyes fair dame that first have murdered me xi the lady looked with fear around as in her bed she lay and though halfdying in a swound thus to herself did say xii who rashly judge it is a rule do often judge amiss i thought this fellow was a fool but there is some sense in this xiii she then recovered heart of grace and did to him reply sure arthur you have forgot your place or know not that it is i xiv do you consider who it is that you thus rudely treat it is not for scoundrel scrubs to wish to taste their masters meat xv tut tut quoth he i do not care and so pulled down the clothes uncovered lay the lady fair from bosom down to toes xvi oh arthur cover me she said or sure i shall get cold which presently the rogue obeyed he could not hear her scold xvii he laid his sword close by her side her heart went pitapat you have but one weapon left she cried sure i can deal with that xviii she saw the looby frighted stand out of the bed jumpt she caught hold of his so furious hand a fight it was to see xix his pistol hand she held fast closed as she remembers well but how the other was disposed there is none alive can tell xx the sword full to his heart she laid but yet him did not slay for when he saw the shining blade god wot he run away xxi when she was sure the knave was gone out of her fathers hall this virtuous lady strait begun most grievously to bawl xxii in came papa and mamma dear who wondered to behold out grisle what a noise is here why stand you in the cold xxiii mamma she said and then she wept i have a battle won but if that i had soundly slept my honor had been gone xxiv a footman of my sister he  a footman cried mamma dear daughter this must never be zds we must go to law xxv this ladys fame shall ever last and live in british song for she was like lucretia chaste and eke was much more strong epistle from arthur gray the footman after his condemnation for attempting a rape this animated poem is omitted in the latter editions of mr dodsleys collection and is therefore reprinted here  by the right honorable lady mary wortley montague read lovely nymph and tremble not to read i have no more to wish nor you to dread i ask not life for life to me were vain and death a refuge from severer pain my only hope in these last lines i try i would be pitied and i then would die long had i lived as sordid as my fate nor cursed the destiny that made me wait a sordid slave content with homely food the gross instinct of appetite pursued youth gave me sleep at night and warmth of blood ambition yet had never touched my breast my lordly master knew no sounder rest with labor healthy in obedience blessed but when i saw  oh had i never seen  that wounding softness that engaging mien the mist or wretched education flies shame fear desire despair and love arise the new creation of those beauteous eyes but yet that love pursued no guilty aim deep in my heart i hid the secret flame i never hoped my fond desire to tell and all my wishes were  to serve you well heavens how i flew when winged by your command and kissed the letters given me by your hand how pleased how proud how fond was i to wait present the sparkling glass or change the plate how when you sung my soul devoured the sound and every sense was in the rapture drowned though bid to go i quite forgot to move  you knew not that stupidity was love but oh the torment not to be expressed the grief the rage the hell that fired this breast when my great rivals in embroidry gay sat by your side or led you from the play i still contrived near as i could to stand the flambeau trembling in my careless hand i saw or thought i saw those fingers pressed for thus their passion by my own i guessed and jealous fury all my soul possessed like torrents love and indignation meet and madness would have thrown me at your feet turn lovely nymph for so i would have said turn from those triflers who make love a trade this is true passion in my eyes you see they cannot no  they cannot love like me frequent debauch has palled their sickly taste faint their desire and in a moment past they sigh not from the heart but from the brain vapors of vanity and more champagne too dull to feel what forms like yours inspire after long talking of their painted fire to some lewd brothel they at night retire there pleased with fancied quality and charms enjoy your beauties in a strumpets arms such are the joys those toasters have in view and such the wit and pleasure they pursue  and is this love that ought to merit you each opera night a new address begun they swear to thousands what they swear to one not thus i sigh  but all my sighs are vain  die wretched arthur and conceal thy pain it is impudence to wish and madness to complain fixed on this view my only hope of ease i waited not the aid of slow disease the keenest instruments of death i sought and death alone employed my laboring thought thus all the night  when i remember well the charming tinkle of your morning bell fired by the sound i hastened with your tea with one last look to smooth the darksome way  but oh how dear that fatal look cost in that fond moment my resolves were lost hence all my guilt and all my sorrows rise  i saw the languid softness of your eyes i saw the dear disorder of your bed your cheeks all glowing with a tempting red your nightclothes tumbled with resistless grace your flowing hair played careless round your face your nightgown fastened with a single pin  fancy improved the wondrous charms within i fixed my eyes upon that heaving breast and hardly hardly i forebore the rest eager to gaze unsatisfied with sight my head grew giddy with the near delight  too well you know the fatal following night the extremest proof of my desire i give and since you will not love i will not live condemned by you i wait the righteous doom careless and fearless of the woes to come but when you see me waver in the wind my guilty flame extinct my soul resigned sure you may pity what you cannot approve the cruel consequence of furious love think the bold wretch who could so greatly dare was tender faithful ardent and sincere think when i held the pistol to your breast had i been of the worlds large rule possessed that would have then been yours and i been blessed think that my life was quite below my care nor feared i any hell beyond despair  if these reflections though they seize you late give some compassion for your arthurs fate enough you give nor ought i to complain you pay my pangs nor have i died in vain mr john philipss designed dedication to his poem called the splendid shilling to w brom esquire of ewithington in the county of hereford sir it would be too tedious an undertaking at this time to examine the rise and progress of dedications the use of them is certainly ancient as appears both from greek and latin authors and we have reason to believe that it was continued without any interruption till the beginning of this century at which time mottos anagrams and frontispieces being introduced dedications were mightily discouraged and at last abdicated but to discover precisely when they were restored and by whom they were first ushered in is a work that far transcends my knowledge a work that can justly be expected from no other pen but that of your operose doctor bentley let us therefore at present acquiesce in the dubiousness of their antiquity and think the authority of the past and present times a sufficient plea for your patronizing and my dedicating this poem especially since in this age dedications are not only fashionable but almost necessary and indeed they are now so much in vogue that a book without one is as seldom seen as a bawdy house without a practice of piety or a poet with money upon this account sir those who have no friends dedicate to all good christians some to their booksellers some for want of a sublunary patron to the manes of a departed one there are that have dedicated to their whores god help those henpeckd writers that have been forced to dedicate to their own wives but while i talk so much of other mens patrons i have forgot my own and seem rather to make an essay on dedications than to write one however sir i presume you will pardon me for that fault and perhaps like me the better for saying nothing to the purpose you sir are a person more tender of other mens reputation than your own and would hear every body commended but yourself should i but mention your skill in turning and the compassion you showed to my fingers ends when you gave me a tobacco stopper you would blush and be confounded with your just praises how much more would you should i tell you what a progress you have made in that abstruse and useful language the saxon since therefore the recital of your excellencies would prove so troublesome i shall offend your modesty no longer give me leave to speak a word or two concerning the poem and i have done this poem sir if we consider the moral the newness of the subject the variety of images and the exactness of the similitudes that compose it must be allowed a piece that was never equalled by the moderns or ancients the subject of the poem is myself a subject never yet handled by any poets how it to be handled by all we may learn by those few divine commendatory verses written by the admirable monsieur le bog yet since i am the subject and the poet too i shall say no more of it lest i should seem vainglorious as for the moral i have took particular care that it should lie incognito not like the ancients who let you know at first sight they design something by their verses but here you may look a good while and perhaps after all find that the poet has no aim or design which must needs be a diverting surprise to the reader what shall i say of the similes that are so full of geography that you must get a welshman to understand them that so raise our ideas of the things they are applied to that are so extraordinarily quaint and well chosen that there is nothing like them so that i think i may without vanity say avia pieridum peragro loca etc yet however excellent this poem is in the reading of it you will find a vast difference between some parts and others which proceeds not from your humble servants negligence but diet this poem was begun when he had little victuals and no moneys and was finished when he had the misfortune at a virtuous ladys house to meet with both but i hope in time sir when hunger and poverty shall once more be my companions to make amends for the defaults of this poem by an essay on minced pies which shall be devoted to you with all submission by  sir your most obliged and humble servant j philips  copy of a letter from mr pit the translator of virgil to mr spence july    blanford      dear jo i am entering into proposals with a bookseller for printing

dishonored strangers close disguise long has he past all unsuspecting eyes all but thy sons  and long has he suppressed the wellconcerted secret in his breast till his brave father should his foes defeat and the close scheme of his revenge complete swift as the word the queen transported sprung and round the dame in strict embraces hung then as the big round tears began to roll spoke the quick doubts and hurry of her soul if my victorious hero safe arrives if my dear lord ulysses still survives tell me oh tell me how he fought alone how were such multitudes destroyed by one naught i beheld but heard their cries she said when death flew raging and the suitors bled immured we listened as we fat around to each deep groan and agonizing sound called by thy son to view the scene i fled and saw ulysses striding over the dead amidst the rising heaps the hero stood all grim and terribly adorned with blood this is enough in conscience for this time besides i am desired by mr pope or mr lintot i dont know which to write to mr pope on a certain affair  original letter from mr george virtue this letter from mr george virtue and the other from prior and elkanah settle have no immediate relation to mr popes correspondence but were found in the same repository  to mr charles christian mr christian pray inform my lord harley that i have on thursday last seen the daughter of milton the poet i carried with me two or three different prints of miltons picture which she immediately knew to be like her father and told me her motherinlaw if living in cheshire had two pictures of him one when he was a school boy and the other when he was about twenty she knows of no other picture of him because she was several years in ireland both before and after his death she was the youngest of miltons daughters by his first wife and was taught to read to her father several languages  mr addison was desirous to see her once and desired she would bring with her testimonials of being miltons daughter but as soon as she came into the room he told her she needed none her face having much of the likeness of the pictures he had seen of him  for my part i find the features of her face very much like the prints i showed her the painting i have to engrave which she believes not to be her fathers picture it being of a brown complexion and black hair and curled locks on the contrary he was of a fair complexion a little red in his cheeks and light brown lank hair  i desire you would acquaint mr prior i was so unfortunate to wait on him on thursday morning last just after he was gone out of town it was with the intent to enquire of him if he remembers a picture of milton in the late lord dorsets collection as i am told this was or if he can inform me how i shall enquire or know the truth of this affair i should be much obliged to him being very willing to have all the certainty on that account before i begin to engrave the plate that it may be the more satisfactory to the public as well as to myself  the sooner you communicate this the better because i want to resolve which i cannot do till i have an answer which will much oblige  your friend to command geo virtue saturday aug         mr prior to mr wanley my good and kind wanley i send you these sheets as looked over first by mr bedford and then by myself i have made great letters at ye me and emphatical words that this may answer to the tenor of the other poems but if in the old it be otherwise printed or you please to alter any thing you know and may use your dictatorial power in a book called the customs of london a folio printed i think in harry the eights time which i gave our wellbeloved lord harley you will find this poem the notbrowne maid  i hope i am to see you at dinner at mr blacks and am always  your obliged and faithful servant m prior thursday noon   th april      mr prior to mr wanley dear wanley i must beg the continuance of your care in the names of the subscribers as you have given it to me in the printing of the books i send you my phiz pray give my service to mrs wanley desiring her to accept it and assuring her that no man loves or esteems her husband and my friend more than  yours m prior january   mr e settle to lord oxford my lord having laid at your lordships feet a divine poem on the holy eucharist i humbly pay my duty to your lordship to know how you are pleased to accept of it being  my lord your lordships most dutiful servant e settle  letters by mr pope to a lady twitenham october    madam we are indebted to heaven for all things and above all for our sense and genius in whatever degree we have it but to fancy yourself indebted to any thing else moves my anger at your modesty the regard i must bear you seriously proceeds from myself alone and i will not suffer even one i like so much as mrs h to have a share in causing it i challenge a kind of relation to you on the souls side which i take to be better than either on a fathers or mothers and if you can overlook an ugly body that stands much in the way of any friendship when it is between different sexes i shall hope to find you a true and constant kinswoman in apollo not that i would place all my pretensions upon that poetical foot much less confine them to it i am far more desirous to be admitted as yours on the more meritorious title of friendship i have ever believed this as a sacred maxim that the most ingenious natures were the most sincere and the most knowing and sensible minds made the best friends of all those that i have thought it the felicity of my life to know i have ever found the most distinguished in capacity the most distinguished in morality and those the most to be depended on whom one esteemed so much as to desire they should be so i beg you to make me no more compliments i could make you a great many but i know you neither need them nor can like them be so good as to think i do not in one word your writings are very good and very entertaining but not so good nor so entertaining as your life and conversation one is but the effect and emanation of the other it will always be a greater pleasure to me to know you are well than that you write well though every time you tell me the one i must know the other i am willing to spare your modesty and therefore as to your writing may perhaps never say more directly to yourself than the few verses i send here which as a proof of my own modesty too i made so long ago as the day you sat for your picture and yet never till now durst confess to you  though sprightly sappho force our love and praise a softer wonder my pleased soul surveys the mild erinna blushing in her bays so while the suns broad beam yet strikes the sight all mild appears the moons more sober light serene in virgin majesty she shines and unobservd the glaring sun declines the brightest wit in the world without the better qualities of the heart must meet with this fate and tends only to endear such a character as i take yours to be in the better discovery and fuller conviction of which i have a strong opinion i shall grow more and more happy the longer i live your acquaintance and if you will indulge me in so much pleasure  your faithful friend and most obliged servant a pope  to the same twitenham nov   madam though i am extremely obliged by your agreeable letter i will avoid all mention of the pleasure you give me that we may have no more words about compliments which i have often observed people talk themselves into while they endeavor to talk themselves out of it is not more the diet of friendship and esteem than a few thin wafers and marmalade were of so hearty a stomach as sanchos in a word i am very proud of my new relation and like parnassus much the better since i found i had so good a neighbor there mrs h who lives at court shall teach two countryfolks sincerity and when i am so happy as to meet you she shall settle the proportions of that regard or goodnature which she can allow you to spare me from a heart which is so much her own as yours is  that lady is the most trusty of friends if the imitation of shakespeare be yours for she made me give my opinion of it with assurance it was none of mrs  i honestly liked and praised it whosesoever it was there is in it a sensible melancholy and too true a picture of human life so true an one that i can scarce wish the verses yours at the expense of your thinking that way so early i rather wish you may love the town which the author of those lines cannot immoderately do these many years it is time enough to like or affect to like the country when one is out of love with all but onesself and therefore studies to become agreeable or easy to onesself retiring into onesself is generally the pisaller of mankind would you have me describe my solitude and grotto to you what if after a long and painted description of them in verse which the writer i have just been speaking of could better make if i can guess by that line no noise but water ever friend to thought what if it ended thus what are the falling rills the pendant shades the morning bowers the evening colonnades but soft recesses for the uneasy mind to sigh unheard in to the passing wind so the struck deer in some sequestered part lies down to die the arrow in his heart there hid in shades and wasting day by day inly he bleeds and pants his soul away if these lines want poetry they do not want sense god almighty long preserve you from a feeling of them the book you mention bruyeres characters will make any one know the world and i believe at the same time despise it which is a sign it will make one know it thoroughly it is certainly the proof of a masterhand that can give such striking likenesses in such slight sketches and in so sew strokes on each subject in answer to your question about shakespeare the book is about a quarter printed and the number of emendations very great i have never indulged my own conjectures but kept merely to such amendments as are authorized by old editions in the authors lifetime but i think it will be a year at least before the whole work can be finished in reply to your very handsome i wish it were a very true compliment upon this head i only desire you to observe by what natural gentle degrees i have sunk to the humble thing i now am first from a pretending poet to a critic then to a low translator lastly to a mere publisher i am apprehensive i shall be nothing that is of any value long except  madam your most obliged and most faithful humble servant a pope i long for your return to town a place i am unfit for but shall not be long out of as soon as i know i may be permitted to wait on you there    to the same thursday night madam it was an agreeable surprise to me to hear of your settlement in town i lie at my lord peterborows in boltonstreet where any commands of yours will reach me tomorrow only on saturday evening i am preengaged if mrs h be to be engaged and if she is by any creature it is by you i hope she will join us i am with great truth  madam your most faithful friend and obliged servant a pope  to the same madam i could not play the impertinent so far as to write to you till i was encouraged to it by a piece of news mrs h tells me which ought to be the most agreeable in the world to any author that you are determined to write no more  it is now the time then not for me only but for every body to write without fear or wit and i shall give you the first example here but for this assurance it would be every way too dangerous to correspond with a lady whose very first sight and very first writings had such an effect upon a man used to what they call fine sights and what they call fine writings yet he has been dull enough to sleep quietly after all he has seen and all he has read till yours broke in upon his stupidity and indolence and totally destroyed it but god be thanked you will write no more so i am in no danger of increasing my admiration of you one way and as to the other you will never i have too much reason to fear open these eyes again with one glimpse of you  i am told you named lately in a letter a place called twitenham with particular distinction that you may not be misconstrued and have your meaning mistaken for the future i must acquaint you madam that the name of the place where mrs h is is not twitenham but richmond which your ignorance in the geography of these parts has made you confound together you will unthinkingly do honor to a paltry hermitage while you speak of twitenham where lives a creature altogether unworthy your memory or notice because he really wishes he had never beheld you nor yours you have spoiled him for a solitaire and a book all the days of his life and put him into such a condition that he thinks of nothing and enquires of nothing but after a person who has nothing to say to him and has left him for ever without hope of ever again regarding or pleasing or entertaining him much less of seeing him he has been so mad with the idea of her as to steal her picture and passes whole days in sitting before it talking to himself and as some people imagine making verses but it is no such matter for as long as he can get any of hers he can never turn his head to his own it is so much better entertained  to the same madam i am touched with shame when i look on the date of your letter i have answered it a hundred times in my own mind which i assure you has few thoughts either so frequent or so lively as those relating to you i am sensibly obliged by you in the comfort you endeavor to give me upon the loss of a friend it is like the shower we have had this morning that just makes the drooping trees hold up their heads but they remain checked and withered at the root the benediction is but a short relief though it comes from heaven itself the loss of a friend is the loss of life after that is gone from us it is all but a gentler decay and wasting and lingering a little longer i was the other day forming a wish for a ladys happiness upon her birthday and thinking of the greatest climax of felicity i could raise step by step to end in this  a friend i fancy i have succeeded in the gradation and send you the whole copy to ask your opinion or which is much the better reason to desire you to alter it to your own wish for i believe you are a woman that can wish for yourself more reasonably than i can for you mrs h made me promise her a copy and to the end she may value it i beg it may be transcribed and sent her by you  to a lady on her birthday      oh be thou blessed with all that heaven can send long life long youth long pleasure  and a friend not with those toys the womanworld admire riches that vex and vanities that tire let joy or ease let affluence or content and the gay conscience of a life wellspent calm every thought inspirit every grace glow in thy heart and smile upon thy face let day improve on day and year on year without a pain a trouble or a fear and ah since death must that dear frame destroy die by some sudden ecstasy of joy in some soft dream may thy mild soul remove and be thy latest gasp a sigh of love pray madam let me see this mended in your copy to mrs hand let it be an exact scheme of happiness drawn and i hope enjoyed by yourself to whom i assure you i wish it all as much as you wish it her i am always with true respect  madam your most faithful friend and most humble servant a pope  to the same twitenham august    madam your last letter tells me that if i do not write in less than a month you will fancy the length of yours frighted me a consciousness that i had upon me of omitting too long to answer it made me look not without some fear and trembling for the date of it but there happened to be none and i hope either that you have forgot how long it is or at least that you cannot think it so long as i do since i writ to you indeed a multitude of things which singly seem trifles and yet all together make a vast deal of business and wholly take up that time which we ought to value above all such things have from day to day made me wanting as well to my own greatest pleasure in this as to my own greatest concerns in other points if i seem to neglect any friend i have i do more than seem to neglect myself as i find daily by the increasing ill constitution of my body and mind i still resolve this course shall not nay i see it cannot be long and i determine to retreat within myself to the only business i was born for and which i am only good for if i am entitled to use that phrase for any thing it is great folly to sacrifice ones self ones time ones quiet the very life of life itself to forms complaisances and amusements which do not inwardly please me and only please a sort of people who regard me no farther than a mere instrument of their present idleness or vanity to say truth the lives of those we call great and happy are divided between those two states and in each of them we poetical fiddlers make but part of their pleasure or of their equipage and the misery is we in our turns are so vain at least i have been so as to choose to pipe without being paid and so silly to be pleased with piping to those who understand music less than ourselves they have put me of late upon a task before i was aware which i am sick and sore of and yet engaged in honor to some persons whom i must neither disobey nor disappoint i mean two or three in the world only to go on with it they make me do as mean a thing as the greatest man of them could do seem to depend and to solicit when i do not want and make a kind of court to those above my rank just as they do to those above theirs when we might much more wisely and agreeably live of ourselves and to ourselves you will easily find i am talking of my translating the odyssey by subscription which looks it must needs look to all the world as a design of mine both upon fame and money when in truth i believe i shall get neither for one i go about without any stomach and the other i shall not go about at all  this freedom of opening my mind upon my own situation will be a proof of trust and of an opinion your goodness of nature has made me entertain that you never profess any degree of good will without being pretty warm in it so i tell you my grievances i hope in god you have none wherewith to make me any return of this kind i hope that was the only one which you communicated in your last about mrs h silence for which she wanted not reproaches from me and has since she says amply atoned for i saw a few lines of yours to her which are more obliging to me than i could have imagined if you put my welfare into the small number of things which you heartily wish for a sensible person of either sex will never wish for many i ought to be a happier man than i ever yet deserved to be  upon a review of your papers i have repented of some of the trivial alterations i had thought of which were very few i would rather keep them till i have the satisfaction to meet you in the winter which i must beg earnestly to do for hitherto methinks you are to me like a spirit of another world a being i admire but have no commerce with i cannot tell but i am writing to a fairy who has left me some favors which i secretly enjoy and shall think it unlucky if not fatal to part with so pray do not expect your verses till farther acquaintance  to the same twitenham sept  0      madam no confidence is so great as that one receives from persons one knows may be believed and in things one is willing to believe i have at last acquired this by mrs h repeated assurances of a thing i am unfeignedly so desirous of as your allowing me to correspond with you in good earnest there is sometimes in men as well as in women a great deal of unaffected modesty and i was sincere all along when i told her personally and told you by my silence that i feared only to seem impertinent while perhaps i seemed negligent to you to tell mrs  any thing like what i really thought of her would have looked so like the common traffic of compliment that pays only to receive and to have told it her in distant or bashful terms would have appeared so like coldness in my sense of good qualities which i cannot find out in any one without feeling from my nature at the same time a great warmth for them that i was quite at a loss what to write or in what style to you but i am resolved plainly to get over all objections and faithfully to assure you if you will help a bashful man to be past all preliminaries and forms i am ready to treat with you for your friendship i know without more ado you have a valuable soul and wit sense and worth enough to make me reckon it provided you will permit it one of the happinesses of my life to have been made acquainted with you  i do not know on the other hand what you can think of me but this for a beginning i will venture to engage that whoever takes me for a poet or a wit as they call it takes me for a creature of less value than i am and that wherever i profess it you shall find me a much better man that is a much better friend or at least a much less faulty one than i am a poet that whatever zeal i may have or whatever regard i may show for things i truly am so pleased with as your entertaining writings yet i shall still have more for your person and for your health and for your happiness i would with as much readiness play the apothecary or the nurse to mend your headakes as i would play the critic to improve your verses i have seriously looked over and over those you entrusted me with and assure you madam i would as soon cheat in any other trust as in this i sincerely tell you i can mend them very little and only in trifles not worth writing about but will tell you every tittle when i have the happiness to see you  i am more concerned than you can reasonably believe for the ill state of health you are at present under but i will appeal to time to show you how sincerely i am if i live long enough to prove myself what i truly am  madam your most faithful servant a pope i am very sick all the while i write this letter which i hope will be an excuse for its being so scribbled    to the same twitenham nov   madam it happened that when i determined to answer yours by the post that followed my receipt of it i was prevented from the first proof i have had the happiness to give you of my warmth and readiness in returning the epitaph with my sincere condolements with you on that melancholy subject but nevertheless i resolved to send you the one though unattended by the other i begged mrs h to enclose it that you might at least see i had not the power to delay a moment the doing what you bid me especially when the occasion of obeying your commands was such as must affect every admirer and wellwisher of honor and virtue in the nation  you had it in the very blots the better to compare the places and i can only say it was done to the best of my judgment and to the extent of my sincerity  i do not wonder that you decline the poetical amusement i proposed to you at this time i know from what little i know of your heart enough at least to convince me it must be too deeply concerned at the loss not only of so great and so near a relation but of a good man a loss this age can hardly ever afford to bear and not often can sustain yet perhaps it is one of the best things that can be said of poetry that it helps us to pass over the toils and troubles of this tiresome journey our life as horses are encouraged and spirited up the better to bear their labor by the jingling of bells about their heads indeed as to myself i have been used to this odd cordial so long that it has no effect upon me but you madam are in your honeymoon of poetry you have seen only the smiles and enjoyed the caresses of apollo nothing is so pleasant to a muse as the first children of the imagination but when once she comes to find it mere conjugal duty and the care of her numerous progeny daily grows upon her it is all a sour tax for past pleasure as the psalmist says on another occasion the age of a muse is scarce above five and twenty all the rest is labor and sorrow i find by experience that his own fiddle is no great pleasure to a common fiddler after once the first good conceit of himself is lost  i long at last to be acquainted with you and mrs h tells me you shall soon be in town and i blessed with the vision i have so long desired pray believe i worship you as much and send my addresses to you as often as to any female saint in heaven it is certain i see you as little unless it be in my sleep and that way too holy hermits are visited by the saints themselves  i am without figures and metaphors yours and hope you will think i have spent all my fiction in my poetry so that i have nothing but plain truth left for my prose with which i am ever  madam your faithful humble servant  to the same five oclock madam i think it a full proof of that unlucky star which upon too many occasions i have experienced that this first this only day that i should have owned happy beyond expectation for i did not till yesterday hope to have seen you so soon i must be forced not to do it i am too sick indeed very ill to go out so far and lie on a bed at my doctors house as a kind of force upon him to get me better with all haste  i am scarce able to see these few lines i write to wish you health and pleasure enough not to miss me today and myself patience to bear being absent from you as well as i can being ill  i am truly your faithful servant a pope  to the same jan           madam after a very long expectation and daily hopes of the satisfaction of seeing and conversing with you i am still deprived of it in a manner that is the most afflicting because it is occasioned by your illness and your misfortune i can bear my own i assure you much better and thus to find you lost to me at the time that i hoped to have regained you doubles the concern i should naturally feel in being deprived of any pleasure whatever  mrs h can best express to you the concern of a friend who esteems and pities for she has the liberty to express it in her actions and the satisfaction of attending on you in your indisposition  i wish sincerely your condition were not such as to debar me from telling you in person how truly i am yours i wish i could do you any little offices of friendship or give you any amusements or help you to what people in your present state most want better spirits if reading to you or writing to you could contribute to entertain your hours or to raise you to a livelier relish of life how well should i think my time employed indeed i should and think it a much better end of my poor studies than all the vanities of fame or views of a character that way which engage most men of my fraternity  if you thoroughly knew the zeal with which i am your servant you would take some notice of the advice i would give you and suffer it to have a weight with you proportionable to the sincerity with which it is given  i beg you to do your utmost to call to you all the succors which your own good sense and natural reflection can suggest to avoid a melancholy way of thinking and to throw up your spirits by intervals of moderate company not to let your distemper fix itself upon your mind at least though it will not entirely quit your body do not indulge too much solitariness though most company be not proper or supportable during your illness force yourself to enter into such as is good and reasonable where you may have your liberty and be under no restraint  why will you not come to your friend mrs h since you are able to go out and since motion is certainly good for your health why will you not make any little sets of such as you are easiest with to sit with you sometimes  do not think i have any interested aim in this advice though i long to see you and to try to amuse you i would not for the world be considered as one that would ever require for my own gratification any thing that might be improper or hurtful to you  pray let me know by our friend mrs h if there can be anything in my power to serve or to amuse you but use me so kindly as not to think ever of writing to me till you are so well as that i may see you and then it will be needless do not even read this if it be the least trouble to your eyes or head  believe me with great respect and the warmest good wishes for your speedy recovery  madam your most faithful and most humble servant a pope  to the same twitenham june        madam it was an inexpressible pleasure to me to see your letter as i assure you it had long been a great trouble to reflect on the melancholy reason of your silence and absence it was that only which hindered my writing not only again but often to you for fear your goodnature should have been prompted to oblige me too much at your own expense by answering indeed i never expressed and never shall be able to express more concern and good wishes for you than i shall ever feel for one of your merit  i am sorry the moment you grow better to have you snatched from those who i may say deserve the pleasure of seeing you in health for having so long lamented and felt your illness  mrs h i hope will find it not impossible to draw you to richmond and if not i dare say will not be long out of hertfordshire i want nothing but the same happy pretense she has of a title through your friendship and the privilege of her sex to be there immediately i cannot but wonder you have not heard from her though i should wonder if any body else had for i am told by her family she has had much of the headake at bath besides the excuse of a great giddiness occasioned naturally by the waters i writ to her at the first going and have not had a word from her and now you tell me the same thing i conclude she has been worse than i imagine i hear she returns on wednesday when i shall have the satisfaction i doubt not to talk and hear a great deal of mrs   i wish i could say any thing either to comfort you when ill or entertain you when well though nothing could in the proper proportion of friendship more affect me than your condition i have not wanted other occasions of great melancholy of which the least is the loss of part of my fortune by a late act of parliament  i am at present in the afflicting circumstance of taking my last leave of one of the bishop atterbury truest friends i ever had and one of the greatest men in all polite learning as well as the most agreeable companion this nation ever had  i really do not love life so dearly or so weakly as to value it on any other score than for that portion of happiness which a friend only can bestow upon it or if i must want that myself for the pleasure which is next it of seeing deserving and virtuous people happy so that indeed i want comfort and the greatest i can receive from you at least unless i were so happy as to deserve what i never can will be to hear you grow better till you grow perfectly well perfectly easy and perfectly happy which no one more sincerely wishes than  madam your faithful and obliged friend and servant a pope  to the same twitenham sept         madam it would be a vanity in me to tell you why i trouble you so soon again i cannot imagine myself of the number of those correspondents whom you call favorite ones yet i know it is thought that industry may make a man what merit cannot and if an old maxim of my lord oxfords be true that in england if a man resolve to be any thing and constantly stick to it he may even a lord treasurer if so i say it shall not be want of resolution that shall hinder me from being a favorite in good earnest i am more ambitious of being so to you madam than i ever was or ever shall be of being one to any prince or which is more any princes minister in christendom  i wish i could tell you any agreeable news of what your heart is concerned in but i have a sort of quarrel to mrs h for not loving herself so well as she does her friends for those she makes happy but not herself  there is an air of sadness about her which grieves me and which i have learnt by experience will increase upon an indolent i will not say an affected resignation to it it will do so in men and much more in women who have a natural softness that sinks them even when reason does not this i tell you in confidence and pray give our friend such hints as may put her out of humor with melancholy your censure or even your raillery may have more weight with her than mine a man cannot either so decently or so delicately take upon him to be a physician in these concealed distempers  you see madam i proceed in trusting you with things that nearly concern me in my last letter i spoke but of a trifle myself in this i advance farther and speak of what touches me more a friend  this beautiful season will raise up so many rural images and descriptions in a poetical mind that i expect you and all such as you if there be any such at least all who are not downright dull translators like your servant must necessarily be productive of verses  i lately saw a sketch this way on the bower of the lines here alluded to are as follows in tempes shades the living lyre was strung and the first pope immortal phoebus sung these happy shades where equal beauty reigns bold rising hills slant vales and farstretchd plains the grateful verdure of the waving woods the soothing murmur of the falling floods a nobler boast a higher glory yield than that which phoebus stamped on tempes field all that can charm the eye or please the ear says harmony itself inhabits here  bedington i could wish you tried something in the descriptive way on any subject you please mixed with vision and moral like pieces of the old provencal poets which abound with fancy and are the most amusing scenes in nature there are three or four of this kind in chaucer admirable the flower and the leaf every body has been delighted with  i have long had an inclination to tell a fairy tale the more wild and exotic the better therefore a vision which is confined to no rules of probability will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of description you will provided there be an apparent moral to it i think one or two of the persian tales would give one hints for such an invention and perhaps if the scenes were taken from real places that are known in order to compliment particular gardens and buildings of a fine taste as i believe several of chaucers descriptions do though it is what nobody has observed it would add great beauty to the whole  i wish you found such an amusement pleasing to you if you did but at leisure form descriptions from objects in nature itself which struck you most livelily i would undertake to find a tale that should bring them all together which you will think an odd undertaking but in a piece of this fanciful and imaginary nature i am sure is practicable excuse this long letter and think no man is more  your faithful and obliged servant a pope  in the preface to an edition of monsieur pouilly de champeauxs works very lately published is the extract of a letter from lord bolingbroke to that gentleman the original and translation are inserted here the comment is left to the reader  it may be necessary to add that monsieur pouilly de champeaux is a writer much esteemed on account of the elegance and spirit of humanity that breathe throughout his literary productions the chief of these is his theory of agreeable sensations as to his political powers they have never yet been celebrated by his countrymen in such a strain as to authorize the following compliment to him on the part of lord bolingbroke  extract enfin mon cher pouilly dans cette foul dhommes que jai pu connoitre et dont jai cherche a etudier lesprit et le charactere je nen ai vu que trois qui maient paru dignes quon leur confiat le soin de gouverner des nations notre amity est trop etroite elle est ainsi que le diroit montaigne trop libre et trop franche dans ses allures pour que je menveloppe avec vous de cette fausse modesty dont il faut quelquefois se fair un bouclier contre lenvie je vous dirai donc hardiment que ces trois hommes sont vous moi et pope  translation my dear friend among the crowd of men whom it may have fallen in my way to know and whose understandings and characters i have endeavored to study i have not yet marked out above three that appeared to me worthy of being trusted with the care of governing nations our friendship is too intimate and as montaigne would perhaps choose to express himself too frank and free in its paces for me to need with you the wrapping myself up in that false modesty of which there is sometimes a necessity for making a shield against envy i shall then tell you boldly that these three men are you myself and pope  end of vol i
