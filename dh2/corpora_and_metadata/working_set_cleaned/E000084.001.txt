iv press of g p putnams sons new york v xvi xvii preface it would be impossible to approach a collection of the writings of washington without taking some notice of the labors of mr jared sparks the earnest conscientious and it must be added often injudicious pioneer in that great task it is just to pay first a high tribute to his indefatigable industry in gathering the material his wide acquaintance with the sources of history of the time and his extensive and generally accurate knowledge of the men engaged in and the affairs connected with the troublous period of the nations birth with the crucial contest for a nations existence he worked with imperfect instruments much of almost vital importance to the truth escaped his attention while family pride and individual selfishness shut him off from manuscript records that would in his hands have added greatly to the value and rounded out more completely the interest of his work it is fitting that due acknowledgment should be made of the great debt that americans owe to his efforts and no one is in a better position to recognize the debt thus due than the writer who has passed over much of the same territory encountered the same difficulties and through experience been xviii brought to a full realization of the greatness of the task accomplished by mr sparks no small part of the results of his labors has been embodied in these volumes in spite however of all that can be said in praise of mr sparks work it must be admitted that his zeal led him into a serious error of judgment so common to heroworshippers not only doing his own reputation as an editor an injury but what is of greater moment conveying a distorted idea of washingtons personal character and abilities—an idea that was rapidly developed into a cult from which it is still difficult to break away and in which it is dangerous to express unbelief finding that washington had at a late period of his life carefully corrected some of his earlier letters erasing and pruning liberally and altering the arrangement of sentences and choice of words wherever his more mature experience pointed out the need mr sparks took the same liberty with the rest of the letters and messages and produced what is perhaps a more uniform work than could otherwise be obtained but one that is singularly colorless when examined to discover the individuality of the writer not only did the editor omit sentences words proper names and even paragraphs without notice to the reader but he materially altered the sense and application of important portions of the letters this has been done upon no welldefined principles no general rules that could account for the expediency or necessity of a change so radical and it must be admitted often so misleading xix and mischievous the young colonel of the virginia regiment serving in the colonial wars writes in mr sparks volumes with the same maturity of style and thought as the president of the established republic the interesting study that might be based upon the gradual mental development of the man from youth to old age is rendered impossible by mr sparks methods of treating the written record and consequently the real character of washington as a man is as little known today as it was to the generation that followed him the patient antiquary can discover a few inedited records of the man written in the full freedom of friendly intercourse but nothing of this nature appears in the collection of mr sparks some protest must be entered against the wholesale and indiscriminate charges of interested motives for his acts that it is now the fashion to bring against mr sparks the blame for many of the changes and omissions cannot be laid at his door his correspondents often misled him wilfully as well as unintentionally his copyists and proofreaders were liable to err while in other instances where he depended upon a printed version the letters were mutilated before they reached his hands as was the case with the correspondence with richard henry lee as published by the lee family i have been fortunate enough to find among the washington manuscripts in the department of state the originals of two of the earlier letterbooks of washington on which mr sparks based his editorial xx work and which had been mislaid for so many years that their very existence was denied they contain the original drafts of his letters all but a few pages are his own writing and the changes he made at a late period of his life are so distinctive both in the form of the letters and the colors of the ink as to make an error of date impossible it is to be regretted that these books were not discovered until after the first pages of this volume were printed when it was too late to utilize this remarkable discovery i have however noted the differences in some of the letters written during the campaign of      volume ii of this collection and the general nature of the changes in construction and language can be recognized from them as a matter of interest a few sentences are taken from the earlier series written during the braddock campaign— george washington fairfax to mrs fairfax as originally written this i took as a gentle rebuke and polite manner of forbidding my corresponding with you and conceive this opinion is not illy founded when i reflect that i have hitherto found it impracticable to engage one moment of your attention if i in this i hope you will excuse my present presumption and lay the imputation to elateness at my successful arrival if on the contrary these are fearfull apprehensions only how easy is it to remove my suspicion   june      as corrected by washington am i to consider the proposed mode of communication as a polite intimation of your wishes to withdraw your correspondence to a certain degree it has that appearance for i have not been honored with a line from you since i parted with you at belvoir if this was your object in what manner shall i apologise for my present disobedience but on the contrary if it was the effect of your delicacy how easy it is to remove my suspicion xxi george washington william byrd to william byrd for i can very truly say i have no expection of reward but the hope of meriting the love of my country and friendly regard of my acquaintance and as to my prospect of obtaining a commission i have none as i am perfectly well assured that it is not in genl braddocks power to give such an one as i would accept of  0 april      for i can truly say i have no expectation of either fee or reward to merit its esteem and the good will of my friends is the sum of my ambition having no prospect of obtaining a commission being perfectly well assured c it would be an ungrateful task as well to the reader as to the editor to attempt an exposition of how mr sparks applied as he thought the same methods to the later correspondence of washington and of the regrettable consequences a casual comparison between his collection and the present volumes will demonstrate the extent of the liberties taken with the text for it has been the wish of the present editor to return to the originals to give the letters as they were first written by washington omitting of course the rough drafts with all their uncouth construction of sentences curious use of words old style of capitalization and frequent abbreviations the various spellings of proper names even of words in ordinary use and the awkward punctuation so often calculated to confuse and mislead in adopting this course i may have erred as much in one direction as mr sparks did in another but i can plead the requirements of the modern historical method demanding fulness and accuracy of detail even to an extreme not to mention the serious obstacles that any middle course would have entailed xxii a difficulty presented itself from the outset the proper management of the enormous mass of material offered was of itself a problem of no small moment the form in which that material was accessible made a proper and satisfactory solution the more delicate and involved i have traced in many instances not only the original drafts or the original letters but copies of the letters sometimes more than one transcript and again printed editions of them no two of which would agree exactly in every detail here was the chief obstacle to my work for did i print the original the variant draft transcript or printed copy could be used as the basis of a charge of inaccuracy and the same charge would lie did i use any but the original form to note all the variations was out of the question not merely because of their number but because of their comparatively little interest to any but the antiquary some compromise was necessary and after a careful examination of the material i determined to note in my last volume the source of the printed version whether an original a draft a transcript contemporary letterbook or a late copy while in notes appended to each letter i propose to give any important variation calling for such attention whereever possible the original letter is used in the text in following so closely almost slavishly the manuscript record a notable lack of uniformity resulted and will to many lend an appearance of careless editing to the printed page this will naturally be more evident in the earlier writings than in those xxiii of the revolutionary and subsequent periods when the burden of the correspondence rested with secretaries to the beginning of the revolution washington composed and wrote all his letters and carefully copied them himself into letterbooks the personal characteristics of the writer show more clearly in these earlier writings and it is for this reason that i have given so many of that period and in such fulness pursuing the same idea i have confined my notes as far as was possible and consistent with clearness to contemporary records and generally to the very words of the writers to attempt even a general summary of what has been said written and conjectured on mooted incidents in his life would have swelled the notes to an unwieldly size the very full and carefully prepared notes in the narrative and critical history of america render such a task unnecessary where i have found a contemporary judgment of washingtons character uncolored by personal hostility or partisan hatred i have quoted it in thus confining myself as closely as possible to what washington wrote and what those who had relations with him thought of his capacity position and acts no violence is done to his reputation nothing is taken that derogates from the extraordinary abilities that showed their efficiency in small as well as in great affairs an awkward word or phrase a strong expression or a severely personal criticism on his contemporaries led to an alteration or rejection by mr sparks not only from a wish to spare xxiv individual reputations but also from an idea that a publication would detract from the greatness of the writer in the present publication nothing of interest or importance is omitted from the record but the result is not destructive of any reputations and brings washington nearer to us in thought and action than before the most agreeable part of my task now lies before me that of acknowledging the kind assistance so liberally afforded me by the possessors of letters of washington and by persons interested in american history many as have been the rebuffs i have received in pursuing my researches—and i regret that i have been denied access to some very important collections of washington letters—they have been far more than compensated by the voluntary kindness of strangers and by the generous acts of friends and fellowstudents of history on both sides of the ocean many difficulties have been made smooth and much of the drudgery involved has been lightened by the encouraging words and marks of appreciation of these good friends to the rich deposit of washington papers in the department of state washington i have had full and free access through the courtesy of hon thomas f bayard mr ainsworth r spofford and his assistants have freely placed before me the resources of the library of congress nor should i omit to mention the historical societies throughout the country which have rarely hesitated to place at my disposal their rich collections of manuscripts and authorities and afforded me every opportunity to xxv utilize their possessions easily first stands the massachusetts historical society to whose librarian mr green i am especially indebted for favors to one and all of these assistants i give thanks reserving special mention for the last volume when my burden of indebtedness will be paid in full i have been specially fortunate in my copyist to whose industry and accuracy i gladly pay some tribute through the courtesy of mr justin winsor and the publishers of the narrative and critical history of america i am enabled to use some of the maps and illustrations prepared for that valuable and encyclopædic work worthington chauncey ford washington january      xxvi   the

concludes my journal    george washington richard to richard dear richard the receipt of your kind favor of the  d of this instant afforded me unspeakable pleasure as i am convinced i am still in the memory of so worthy a friend—a friendship i shall ever be proud of increasing yours gave me the more pleasure as i received it amongst a parcel of barbarians and an uncouth set of people the like favor often repeated would give me pleasure altho i seem to be in a place where no real satisfaction is to be had since you received my letter in october last i have not sleepd above three nights or four in a bed but after walking a good deal all the day i lay down before the fire upon a little hay straw fodder or bearskin which ever is to be had with man wife and children like a parcel of dogs and cats and happy is he who gets the berth nearest the fire there s nothing would make it pass off tolerably but a good reward a doubloon is my constant gain every day that the weather will permit my going out and sometimes six pistoles the coldness of the weather will not allow of my making a long stay as the lodging is rather too cold for the time of year i have never had my clothes off but lay and sleep in them except the few nights i have layn in frederic town george washington john robinson to robin dear friend robin as it s the greatest mark of friendship and esteem absent friends can shew each other in writing   and often communicating their thoughts to his fellow companions i make one endeavor to signalize myself in acquainting you from time to time and at all times my situation and employments of life and could wish you would take half the pains of contriving me a letter by any opportunity as you may be well assured of its meeting with a very welcome reception my place of residence is at present at his lordships where i might was my heart disengaged pass my time very pleasantly as there s a very agreeable young lady lives in the same house colonel george fairfaxs wifes sister but as that s only adding fuel to fire it makes me the more uneasy for by often and unavoidably being in company with her revives my former passion for your lowland beauty whereas was i to live more retired from young women i might in some measure eliviate my sorrows by burying that chaste and troublesome passion in the grave of oblivion or etarnall forgetfulness for as i am very well assured that s the only antidote or remedy that i ever shall be relieved by or only recess that can administer any cure or help to me as i am well convinced was i ever to attempt any thing i should only get a denial which would be only adding grief to uneasiness         george washington may  0      wm fauntleroy to wm fauntleroy sr may  0      sir i should have been down long before this but my business in frederick detained me somewhat longer than i expected and immediately upon my return from thence i was taken with a violent pleurise which has reduced me very low but purpose as soon as i recover my strength to wait on miss betsy  in hopes of a revocation of the former cruel sentence and see if i can meet with any alteration in my favor i have enclosed a letter to her which should be much obliged to you for the delivery of it i have nothing to add but my best respects to your good lady and family      journal to the ohio      for some years trouble had been brewing between the french and english on the ohio frontiers of the colonies each nation laying claim to a possession of the soil and seeking by every means to monopolize the important fur trade with the indians english governors were granting lands and english traders and settlers were pushing over the mountains establishing stations and seeking the aid of the indians—steps that were regarded by the french as encroachments and that urged them to take counter measures to establish and maintain their claims in      céleron de bienville passed from la chine to the ohio and down as far as the great miami conciliating the indians with gifts or gaining their assent to his acts by threats and warning off english traders formally took possession of the country in the name of his master louis xv while these events were taking place the ohio company was formed in virginia to found a colony in the region in dispute and under a crown grant prepared to take possession sending a trader christopher gist to select and locate  0 the land on their side the french constructed several forts from england the colonial governors received notice of these encroachments and were instructed to require the subjects of any foreign powers trespassing or building forts on the territory claimed to desist from any such unlawful undertakings and if this requisition should not be obeyed to employ force  it was in response to these orders that governor dinwiddie sent washington to the ohio and thus forestalled the action of pennsylvania the matter of the requisition enjoined by lord holdernesses letter was again taken into consideration and a form agreed upon but several persons who came to town from virginia reporting that governor dinwiddie had sent an officer to the french camp on that errand and it being uncertain what part the assembly of this province would take in this affair it was agreed to postpone it till it should be known what governor dinwiddie had done or proposed to do—penn col rec v  0  dinwiddie wrote to governor hamilton on november   th that he had sent a person of distinction to the commander of the french upon the publication of the following journal copies were sent to all the colonial governors advertisement as it was thought adviseable by his honour the governor to have the following account of my proceedings to and from the french on ohio committed to print i think i can do no less than apologize in some measure for the numberless imperfections of it there intervened but one day between my arrival in williamsburg and the time for the councils meeting for me to prepare and transcribe from the rough minutes i had taken in my travels this journal the writing of which only was sufficient to employ me closely the whole time consequently admitted of no leisure to consult of a new and proper form to offer it in or to correct or amend the diction of the old neither was i apprised nor did in the least conceive when i wrote this for his honours perusal that it ever would be published or even have more than a cursory reading till i was informed at the meeting of the present general assembly that it was already in the press there is nothing can recommend it to the public but this those things which came under the notice of my own observation    i have been explicit and just in a recital of—those which i have gathered from report i have been particularly cautious not to augment but collected the opinions of the several intelligencers and selected from the whole the most probable and consistent account  g washington wednesday october         i was commissioned and appointed by the honourable robert dinwiddie esq governor c of virginia to visit and deliver a letter to the commandant of the french forces on the ohio and set out on the intended journey the same day the next i arrived at fredericksburg and engaged mr jacob vanbraam  to be my french interpreter and proceeded with him to alexandria where we provided necessaries from thence we went to winchester and got baggage horses c and from thence we pursued the new road to willscreek  where we arrived the   th of november here i engaged mr gist  to pilot us out and also hired four others as servitors barnaby currin and john macquire indian traders henry steward    and william jenkins and in company with those persons left the inhabitants the day following  the excessive rains and vast quantity of snow which had fallen prevented our reaching mr fraziers an indian trader at the mouth of turtle creek on monongahela river till thursday the   d we were informed here that expresses had been sent a few days before to the traders down the river to acquaint them with the french generals  death and the return of the major part of the french army into winter quarters the waters were quite impassable without swimming our horses which obliged us to get the loan of a canoe from frazier and to send barnaby currin and henry steward down the monongahela with our baggage to meet us at the forks of ohio about  0 miles there to cross the aligany     as i got down before the canoe i spent some time in viewing the rivers and the land in the fork which i think extremely well situated for a fort as it has the absolute command of both rivers the land at the point is  0 or    feet above the common surface of the water and a considerable bottom of flat welltimbered land all around it very convenient for building the rivers are each a quarter of a mile or more across and run here very near at right angles aligany bearing n e and monongahela s e the former of these two is a very rapid and swift running water the other deep and still without any perceptible fall about two miles from this on the south east side of the river at the place where the ohio company intended to erect a fort lives shingiss  king of the delawares we called upon him to invite him to council at the loggstown  as i had taken a good deal of notice yesterday of the situation at the forks my curiosity led me to examine this more particularly and i think it greatly inferior either for defence or advantages especially the latter for a fort at the forks would be equally well situated on the ohio and have the entire command of the monongahela which runs up to our settlements    and is extremely well designed for water carriage as it is of a deep still nature besides a fort at the fork might be built at a much less expence than at the other place nature has well contrived this lower place for water defence but the hill whereon it must stand being about a quarter of a mile in length and then descending gradually on the land side will render it difficult and very expensive to make a sufficient fortification there—the whole flat upon the hill must be takenin the side next the descent made extremely high or else the hill itself cut away otherwise the enemy may raise batteries within that distance without being exposed to a single shot from the fort shingiss attended us to the loggstown where we arrived between sunsetting and dark the   th day after i left williamsburg we travelled over some extreme good and bad land to get to this place— as soon as i came into town i went to monakatoocha  as the halfking was out at his huntingcabbin on little beavercreek about    miles off and informed him by john davison my indian interpreter that i was sent a messenger to the french general and was ordered to call upon the sachems of the six nations to acquaint them with it—i gave him a string of wampum  and a twist of tobacco and    desired him to send for the halfking which he promised to do by a runner in the morning and for other sachems—i invited him and the other great men present to my tent where they stayd about an hour and returnd according to the best observations i could make mr gists new settlement which we passd by bears about w n w  0 miles from willscreek shanapins or the forks n by w or n n w about  0 miles from that and from thence to the loggstown the course is nearly west about    or  0 miles so that the whole distance as we went and computed it is at least     or   0 miles from our back inhabitants   th came to town four or ten frenchmen who had deserted from a company at the kuskuskas  which lies at the mouth of this river i got the following account from them they were sent from neworleans with  00 men and   canoeloads of provisions to this place where they expected to have met the same number of men from the forts on this side lake erie to convey them and the stores up who were not arrived when they ranoff i enquired into the situation of the french on the mississippi their number and what forts they had built they informd me that there were four small forts between new orleans and the blackislands     garrisond with about  0 or  0 men and a few small pieces in each that at new orleans which is near the mouth of the mississippi there are    companies of  0 men each with a pretty strong fort mounting   carriage guns and at the blackislands there are several companies and a fort with   guns the blackislands are about   0 leagues above the mouth of the ohio which is about   0 above neworleans they also acquainted me that there was a small pallisadod fort  on the ohio at the mouth of the obaish  about  0 leagues from the mississippi the obaish heads near the west end of lake erie and affords the communication between the french on mississippi and those on the lakes these deserters came up from the lower shanoah town  with one brown an indian trader and were going to philadelphia  about   oclock this evening the halfking came to town i went up and invited him with davison privately to my tent and desird him to relate some of the particulars of his journey to the french commandant and reception there also to give me an account of the ways and distance he told me that the nearest and levellest way was now impassable by    reason of many large mirey savannas that we must be obliged to go by venango  and should not get to the near fort under   or   nights sleep good travelling when he went to the fort he said he was received in a very stern manner by the late commander who askd him very abruptly what he had come about and to declare his business which he said he did in the following speech— fathers i am come to tell you your own speeches what your own mouths have declared fathers you in former days set a silver bason before us wherein there was the leg of a beaver and desird all the nations to come and eat of it to eat in peace and plenty and not to be churlish to one another and that if any such person should be found to be a disturber i here lay down by the edge of the dish a rod which you must scourge them with and if i your father should get foolish in my old days i desire you may use it upon me as well as others now fathers it is you who are the disturbers in this land by coming and building your towns and taking it away unknown to us and by force fathers we kindled a fire a long time ago at a place called montreal where we desired you to stay and not to come and intrude upon our land i now desire you may dispatch to that place for be it known to you fathers that this is our land and not yours fathers i desire you may hear me in civilness if not we must handle that rod which was laid down for the use of the abstreperous if you had come in a peaceable manner like our brothers the english we should not have been against your trading with us as they do but to come fathers and build houses upon our land and to take it by force is what we cannot submit to fathers both you and the english are white we live in a country between therefore the land belongs to neither one nor    tother but the great being above allowd it to be a place of residence for us so fathers i desire you to withdraw as i have done our brothers the english for i will keep you at arms length i lay this down as a trial for both to see which will have the greatest regard to it and that side we will stand by and make equal shares with us our brothers the english have heard this and i come now to tell it to you for i am not afraid to discharge you off this land this he said was the substance of what he spoke to the general who made this reply now my child i have heard your speech you spoke first but it is my time to speak now where is my wampum that you took away with the marks of towns in it this wampum i do not know which you have discharged me off the land with but you need not put yourself to the trouble of speaking for i will not hear you i am not afraid of flies or musquitos for indians are such as those i tell you down that river i will go and will build upon it according to my command if the river was blockd up i have forces sufficient to burst it open and tread under my feet all that stand in opposition together with their alliances for my force is as the sand upon the sea shore therefore here is your wampum i fling it at you child you talk foolish you say this land belongs to you but there is not the black of my nail yours i saw that land sooner than you did before the shannoahs and you were at war lead was the man who went down and took possession of that river it is my land and i will have it let who will standup for or sayagainst it ill buy and sell with the english mockingly if people will be ruld by me they may expect kindness but not else the halfking told me he enquired of the general after two englishmen who were made prisoners and received this answer child you think it is a very great hardship that i made prisoners of those two people at venango dont you concern yourself    with it we took and carried them to canada to get intelligence of what the english were doing in virginia he informed me that they had built two forts one on lake erie  and another on frenchcreek  near a small lake about    miles asunder and a large waggon road between they are both built after the same model but different in the size that on the lake the largest he gave me a plan of them of his own drawing the indians enquired very particularly after their brothers in carolina goal they also asked what sort of boy it was who was taken from the southbranch for they were told by some indians that a party of french indians had carried a white boy by the kuskuska town towards the lakes   th we met in council at the longhouse about   oclock where i spoke to them as follows brothers i have called you together in council by order of your brother the governor of virginia to acquaint you that i am sent with all possible dispatch to visit and deliver a letter to the french commandant of very great importance to your brothers the english and i dare say to you their friends and allies i was desired brothers by your brother the governor to call upon you the sachems of the nations to inform you of it and to ask your advice and assistance to proceed the nearest and best road to the french you see brothers i have gotten thus far on my journey his honour likewise desired me to apply to you for some of your young men to conduct and provide provisions for us on our  0 way and be a safeguard against those french indians who have taken up the hatchet against us i have spoke this particularly to you brothers because his honour our governor treats you as good friends and allies and holds you in great esteem to confirm what i have said i give you this string of wampum after they had considered for some time on the above discourse the halfking got up and spoke— now my brothers in regard to what my brother the governor has desired me i return you this answer i rely upon you as a brother ought to do as you say we are brothers and one people we shall put heart in hand and speak to our fathers the french concerning the speech they made to me and you may depend that we will endeavour to be your guard brother as you have asked my advice i hope you will be ruled by it and stay till i can provide a company to go with you the french speechbelt is not here i have it to go for to my hunting cabbin likewise the people whom i have ordered in are not yet come nor cannot till the third night from this till which time brother i must beg you to stay i intend to send a guard of mingos  shannoahs and delawares  that our brothers may see the love and loyalty we bear them as i had orders to make all possible dispatch and waiting here was very contrary to my inclinations i thanked him in the most suitable manner i could and told him that my business required the greatest    expedition and would not admit of that delay he was not well pleased that i should offer to go before the time he had appointed and told me that he could not consent to our going without a guard for fear some accident should befal us and draw a reflection upon him besides says he this is a matter of no small moment and must not be entered into without due consideration for now i intend to deliver up the frenchspeechbelt and make the shanoahs and delawares do the same and accordingly he gave orders to king shingiss who was present to attend on wednesday night with the wampum and two men of their nation to be in readiness to setout with us next morning as i found it was impossible to getoff without affronting them in the most egregious manner i consented to stay i gave them back a string of wampum which i met with at mr fraziers and which they had sent with a speech to his honour the governor to inform him that three nations of french indians viz chippoways ottoways and orundaks  had takenup the hatchet against the english and desired them to repeat it over again but this they postponed doing till they met in full council with the shannoahs and delaware chiefs   th runners were now dispatched very early for    the shannoah chiefs the halfking set out himself to fetch the frenchspeechbelt from his hunting cabbin   th he returned this evening and came with monokatoocha and two other sachems to my tent and begged as they had complied with his honour the governors request in providing men c to know on what business we were going to the french this was a question i all along expected and had provided as satisfactory answers to as i could which allayed their curiosity a little monokatoocha informed me that an indian from venango brought news a few days ago that the french had called all the mingos delawares c together at that place and told them that they intended to have been down the river this fall but the waters were growing cold and the winter advancing which obliged them to go into quarters but that they might assuredly expect them in the spring with a far greater number and desired that they might be quite passive and not to intermeddle unless they had a mind to draw all their force upon them for that they expected to fight the english three years as they supposed there would be some attempts made to stop them in which time they should conquer but that if they should prove equally strong they and the english would join to cut them all off and divide the land between them that though they had lost their general and some few of their soldiers yet there were men enough to reinforce them and make them masters of the ohio    this speech he said was delivered to them by one captain joncaire  their interpreter in chief living at venango and a man of note in the army   th the halfking and monokatoocha came very early and begged me to stay one day more for notwithstanding they had used all the diligence in their power the shanoah chiefs had not brought the wampum they ordered but would certainly be in tonight if not they would delay me no longer but would send it after us as soon as they arrived—when i found them so pressing in their request and knew that returning of wampum was the abolishing of agreements and giving this up was shakingoff all dependance upon the french i consented to stay as i believed an offence offered at this crisis might be attended with greater ill consequence than another days delay they also informed me that shingiss could not getin his men and was prevented from coming himself by his wifes sickness i believe by fear of the french but that the wampum of that nation was lodged with kustaloga one of their chiefs at venango in the evening late they came again and acquainted me that the shannoahs were not yet arrived but that it should not retard the prosecution of our journey he delivered in my hearing the speeches that were to be made to the french by jeskakake one of their old chiefs which was givingup the belt    the late commandant had asked for and repeating near the same speech he himself had done before he also delivered a string of wampum to this chief which was sent by king shingiss to be given to kustaloga with orders to repair to the french and deliver up the wampum he likewise gave a very large string of black and white wampum which was to be sent up immediately to the six nations if the french refused to quit the land at this warning which was the third and last time and was the right of this jeskakake to deliver  0th last night the great men assembled to their councilhouse to consult further about this journey and who were to go the result of which was that only three of their chiefs with one of their best hunters should be our convoy the reason they gave for not sending more after what had been proposed at council the   th was that a greater number might give the french suspicions of some bad design and cause them to be treated rudely but i rather think they could not get their hunters in  we set out about   oclock with the halfking jeskakake white thunder and the hunter and travelled on the road to venango where we arrived the     th of december without any thing remarkable happening but a continued series of bad weather this is an old indian town situated at the mouth of french creek on ohio and lies near n about  0 miles from the loggstown but more than  0 the way we were obliged to go we found the french colours hoisted at a house from which they had driven mr john frazier an english subject i immediately repaired to it to know where the commander resided there were three officers one of whom capt joncaire informed me that he had the command of the ohio but that there was a general officer at the near fort where he advised me to apply for an answer he invited us to sup with them and treated us with the greatest complaisance the wine as they dosed themselves pretty plentifully with it soon banished the restraint which at first appeared in their conversation and gave a licence to their tongues to reveal their sentiments more freely they told me that it was their absolute design to take possession of the ohio and by g— they would do it for that altho they were sensible the english could raise two men for their one yet they knew their motions were too slow and dilatory to prevent any undertaking of theirs they pretend to have an undoubted right to the river from a discovery made by one la salle  0 years ago and the rise of this expedition is to prevent our settling on the river or waters of it as they had    heard of some families movingout in order thereto from the best intelligence i could get there have been   00 men on their side ontario lake but upon the death of the general all were recalled to about   or  00 who were left to garrison four forts   0 or there abouts in each the first of them is on frenchcreek near a small lake about  0 miles from venango near nnw the next lies on lake erie where the greater part of their stores are kept about    miles from the other from this it is   0 miles to the carrying place at the falls of lake erie where there is a small fort  which they lodge their goods at in bringing them from montreal the place whence all their stores come from the next fort lies about  0 miles from this on ontariolake  between this fort and montreal there are three others the first  of which is near opposite to the english fort oswego from the fort on lake erie to montreal is about  00 miles which they say requires no more if good weather than four weeks voyage if they go in barks or large vessels so that they may cross the lake but if they come in canoes it will require   or   weeks for they are obliged to keep under the shore  th raind excessively all day which prevented our travelling capt joncaire sent for the halfking as he had but just heard that he came with me he affected to be much concerned that i did not make free to bring them in before i excused it in the best manner i was capable and told him i did    not think their company agreeable as i had heard him say a good deal in dispraise of indians in general but another motive prevented me from bringing them into his company i knew he was interpreter and a person of very great influence among the indians and had lately used all possible means to draw them over to their interest therefore i was desirous of giving no opportunity that could be avoided when they came in there was great pleasure expressed at seeing them he wondered how they could be so near without coming to visit him made several trifling presents and applied liquor so fast that they were soon rendered incapable of the business they came about notwithstanding the caution which was given   th the halfking came to my tent quite sober and insisted very much that i should stay and hear what he had to say to the french i fain would have prevented his speaking any thing till he came to the commandant but could not prevail he told me that at this place a council fire was kindled where all their business with these people was to be transacted and that the management of the indian affairs was left solely to monsieur joncaire as i was desirous of knowing the issue of this i agreed    to stay but sent our horses a little way up french creek to raft over and encamp which i knew would make it near night about  0 oclock they met in council the king spoke much the same as he had before done to the general and offered the french speechbelt which had before been demanded with the marks of four towns on it which monsieur joncaire refused to receive but desired him to carry it to the fort to the commander  th monsieur la force commissary of the french stores and three other soldiers came over to accompany us up we found it extremely difficult to get the indians off today as every stratagem had been used to prevent their goingup with me i had last night left john davison the indian interpreter whom i brought with me from town and strictly charged him not to be out of their company as i could not get them over to my tent for they had some business with kustaloga and chiefly to know the reason why he did not deliver up the french belt which he had in keeping but i was obliged to send mr gist over today to fetch them which he did with great persuasion     at    oclock we set out for the fort and were prevented from arriving there till the   th by excessive rains snows and bad travelling through many mires and swamps these we were obliged to pass to avoid crossing the creek which was impossible either by fording or rafting the water was so high and rapid we passed over much good land since we left venango and through several extensive and very rich meadows one of which i believe was near four miles in length and considerably wide in some places   th i prepared early to wait upon the commander and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command i acquainted him with my business and offered my commission and letter both of which he desired me to keep till the arrival of monsieur riparti captain at the next fort who was sent for and expected every hour this commander is a knight of the military order of st lewis and named legardeur de st pierre  he is an elderly gentleman and has much the air of a soldier he was sent over to take the command  0 immediately upon the death of the late general and arrived here about seven days before me at   oclock the gentleman who was sent for arrived when i offered the letter c again which they received and adjourned into a private apartment for the captain to translate who understood a little english after he had done it the commander desired i would walkin and bring my interpreter to peruse and correct it which i did   th the chief officers retired to hold a council of war which gave me an opportunity of taking the dimensions of the fort and making what observations i could it is situated on the south or west fork of french creek near the water and is almost surrounded by the creek and a small branch of it which forms a kind of island four houses compose the sides the bastions are made of piles driven into the ground standing more than    feet above it and sharp at top with portholes cut for cannon and loopholes for the small arms to fire through there are eight   lb pieces mounted in each bastion and one piece of four pound before the gate in the bastions are a guardhouse chapel doctors lodging and the commanders private store round which are laid platforms for the cannon and men to stand on there are several barracks without the fort for the soldiers dwelling covered some with bark and some with boards made chiefly of loggs there are also several other houses such as stables smiths shop c a  fort du quesne and vicinity from father abrahams almanac key   monongahela river   fort du quesne   the small fort   alleghany river   alleghany indian town   shanapins   yauyaugany river   ohio or alleghany river   logstown  0 beaver creek    kuskaskies the chief town of the six nations    shingoes town    alleguippes    sennakaas    tuttle turtle creek    pine creek from the narrative and critical history of america by courtesy of the publishers    i could get no certain account of the number of men here but according to the best judgment i could form there are an hundred exclusive of officers of which there are many i also gave orders to the people who were with me to take an exact account of the canoes which were hauledup to convey their forces down in the spring this they did and told  0 of birch bark and   0 of pine besides many others which were blockedout in readiness to make   th as the snow encreased very fast and our horses daily became weaker i sent them off unloaded under the care of barnaby currin and two others to make all convenient dispatch to venango and there wait our arrival if there was a prospect of the rivers freezing if not then to continue down to shanapins town at the forks of ohio and there to wait till we came to cross aliganey intending myself to go down by water as i had the offer of a canoe or two as i found many plots concerted to retard the indians business and prevent their returning with me i endeavord all that lay in my power to frustrate their schemes and hurry them on to execute their intended design they accordingly pressed for admittance this evening which at length was granted them privately with the commander and one or two other officers the halfking told me that he offerd the wampum to the commander who evaded taking it and made many fair promises of love and friendship said he wanted to live in peace and trade    amicably with them as a proof of which he would send some goods immediately down to the loggstown for them but i rather think the design of that is to bring away all our straggling traders they meet with as i privately understood they intended to carry an officer c with them and what rather confirms this opinion i was enquiring of the commander by what authority he had made prisoners of several of our english subjects he told me that the country belongd to them that no englishman had a right to trade upon those waters and that he had orders to make every person prisoner who attempted it on the ohio or the waters of it i enquird of capt riparti about the boy who was carried by this place as it was done while the command devolved on him between the death of the late general and the arrival of the present he acknowledged that a boy had been carried past and that the indians had two or three white mens scalps i was told by some of the indians at venango eight but pretended to have forgotten the name of the place which the boy came from and all the particular facts though he had questiond him for some hours as they were carrying him past i likewise enquired what they had done with john trotter and james macclocklan two pensylvania traders whom they had taken with all their goods they told me that they had been sent to canada but were now returned home this evening i received an answer to his honour the governors letter from the commandant      th the commandant ordered a plentiful store of liquor provision c to be put on board our canoe and appeared to be extremely complaisant though he was exerting every artifice which he could invent to set our own indians at variance with us to prevent their going till after our departure presents rewards and every thing which could be suggested by him or his officers—i cant say that ever in my life i suffered so much anxiety as i did in this affair i saw that every stratagem which the most fruitful brain could invent was practised to win the halfking to their interest and that leaving him here was giving them the opportunity they aimed at—i went to the halfking and pressd him in the strongest terms to go he told me the commandant would not discharge him till the morning i then went to the commandant and desired him to do their business and complaind of ill treatment for keeping them as they were part of my company was detaining me this he promised not to do but to forward my journey as much as he could he protested he did not keep them but was ignorant of the cause of their stay though i soon found it out—he had promised them a present of guns c if they would wait till the morning as i was very much pressd by the indians to wait this day for them i consented on a promise that nothing should hinder them in the morning   th the french were not slack in their inventions to keep the indians this day also but as they were obligated according to promise to give the present    they then endeavoured to try the power of liquor which i doubt not would have prevailed at any other time than this but i urged and insisted with the king so closely upon his word that he refrained and set off with us as he had engaged we had a tedious and very fatiguing passage down the creek several times we had like to have been staved against rocks and many times were obliged all hands to get out and remain in the water half an hour or more getting over the shoals at one place the ice had lodged and made it impassable by water therefore we were obliged to carry our canoe across a neck of land a quarter of a mile over we did not reach venango till the   d where we met with our horses this creek is extremely crooked i dare say the distance between the fort and venango cant be less than   0 miles to follow the meanders    d when i got things ready to setoff i sent for the half king to know whether he intended to go with us or by water he told me that whitethunder had hurt himself much and was sick and unable to walk therefore he was obliged to carry him down    in a canoe as i found he intended to stay here a day or two and knew that monsieur joncaire would employ every scheme to set him against the english as he had before done i told him i hoped he would guard against his flattery and let no fine speeches influence him in their favour he desired i might not be concerned for he knew the french too well for any thing to engage him in their behalf and that though he could not go down with us he yet would endeavour to meet at the forks with joseph campbell to deliver a speech for me to carry to his honour the governor he told me he would order the young hunter to attend us and get provision c if wanted our horses were now so weak and feeble and the baggage so heavy as we were obliged to provide all the necessaries which the journey would require that we doubted much their performing it therefore myself and others except the drivers who were obliged to ride gave up our horses for packs to assist along with the baggage i put myself in an indian walking dress and continued with them three days till i found there was no probability of their getting home in any reasonable time the horses grew less able to travel every day the cold increased very fast and the roads were becoming much worse by a deep snow continually freezing therefore as i was uneasy to get back to make report of my proceedings to his honour the governor i determined to prosecute my journey the nearest way through the woods on foot accordingly i left mr vanbraam in charge of    our baggage with money and directions to provide necessaries from place to place for themselves and horses and to make the most convenient dispatch in travelling i took my necessary papers pulled off my cloaths and tied myself up in a match coat then with gun in hand and pack at my back in which were my papers and provisions i setout with mr gist fitted in the same manner on wednesday the   th the day following just after we had passed a place called the murderingtown where we intended to quit the path and steer across the country for shannapins town we fell in with a party of french indians who had lain in wait for us one of them fired at mr gist or me not    steps off but fortunately missed we took this fellow into custody and kept him till about   oclock at night then let him go and walked all the remaining part of the night without making any stop that we might get the start so far as to be out of the reach of their pursuit the next day since we were well assured they would follow our tract as soon as it was light the next day we continued travelling till quite dark and got to the river about two miles above shannapins we expected to have found the river frozen but it was not only about  0 yards from each shore the ice i suppose had broken up above for it was driving in vast quantities     there was no way for getting over but on a raft which we set about with but one poor hatchet and    finished just after sunsetting this was a whole days work then set off but before we were half way over we were jammed in the ice in such a manner that we expected every moment our raft to sink and ourselves to perish i putout my setting pole to try to stop the raft that the ice might pass by when the rapidity of the stream threw it with so much violence against the pole that it jerked me out into ten feet water but i fortunately saved myself by catching hold of one of the raft logs notwithstanding all our efforts we could not get the raft to either shore but were obliged as we were near an island to quit our raft and make to it the cold was so extremely severe that mr gist had all his fingers and some of his toes frozen but the water was shut up so hard that we found no difficulty in gettingoff the island on the ice in the morning and went to mr fraziers we met here with  0 warriors who were going to the southward to war but coming to a place upon the head of the great kunnaway where they found seven people killed and scalped all but one woman with very light hair they turned about and ran back for fear the inhabitants should rise and take them as the authors of the murder they report that the bodies were lying about the house and some of them much torn and eaten by hogs by the marks which were left they say they were french indians of the ottaway nation c who did it as we intended to take horses here and it required some time to find them i wentup about three miles to the mouth of yaughyaughane to visit    queen aliquippa who had expressed great concern that we passed her in going to the fort i made her a present of a matchcoat and a bottle of rum which latter was thought much the best present of the two tuesday the  st day of january we left mr fraziers house  and arrived at mr gists at monongahela the  d where i bought a horse saddle etc the  th we met    horses loaded with materials and stores for a fort at the forks of ohio and the day after some families going out to settle this day we arrived at wills creek after as fatiguing a journey as it is possible to conceive rendered so by excessive bad weather from the first day of december to the   th there was but one day on which it did not rain or snow incessantly and throughout the whole journey we met with nothing but one continued series of cold wet weather which occasioned very uncomfortable lodgings especially after we had quitted our tent which was some screen from the inclemency of it on the   th i got to belvoir where i stopped one day to take necessary rest and then set out and arrived in williamsburgh the   th when i waited upon his honour the governor with the letter i had brought from the french commandant and to give an account of the success of my proceedings this i beg leave to do by offering the foregoing narrative as it contains the most remarkable occurrences which happened in my journey i hope what has been said will be sufficient to make your honour satisfied with my conduct for  0 that was my aim in undertaking the journey and chief study throughout the prosecution of it          george washington   march      alexandria governor dinwiddie to dinwiddie lieutenantgovernor of virginia alexandria   march       honble sir in my last by mr stewart i slightly mentioned the objection many had against enlisting to wit not    knowing who was to be paymaster or the times for payment it is now grown a pretty general clamor and some of those who were among the first enlisters being needy and knowing it to be usual for his majestys soldiers to be paid once a week or at most every fortnight are very importunate to receive their due i have soothed and quieted them as much as possible under pretence of receiving your honours instructions in this particular at the arrival of the colonel i have increased my number of men to about    and dare venture to say i should have had several more if the excessive bad weather did not prevent their meeting agreeable to their officers commands we daily experience the great necessity for cloathing the men as we find the generality of those who are to be enlisted are of those loose idle persons that are quite destitute of house and home and i may truly say many of them of cloathes which last renders them very incapable of the necessary service as they must unavoidably be exposed to inclement weather in their marches c and can expect no other than to encounter almost every difficulty that s incident to a soldiers life there are many of them without shoes others want stockings some are without shirts and not a few that have scarce a coat or waistcoat to their backs in short they are as ill provided as can well be conceived but i really believe every man of them for their own credits sake is willing to be cloathed at their own expense they are perpetually teazing me to have it done but    i am not able to advance the money provided there was no risque in it which there certainly is and too great for me to run tho it would be nothing to the country as a certain part of their pay might be deducted and appropriated to that use mr carlyle or any of the merchants here would furnish them with proper necessarys if there was a certainty of any part of their pay stopt to reimburse the expense but i must here in time put a kirb to my requests and remember that i ought not to be too importunate otherwise i shall be as troublesome to your honour as the soldiers are to me there is nothing but the necessity of the thing could urge me to be thus free but i shall no more exagerate this affair to your honour as i am well assured whatever you think for the benefit or good of the expedition you will cause to have done george washington march      richard corbin to richard corbin  march       dear sir in a conversation with you at green spring you gave me some room to hope for a commission above that of major and to be ranked among    the chief officers of this expedition the command of the whole forces is what i neither look for expect nor desire for i must be impartial enough to confess it is a charge too great for my youth and inexperience to be entrusted with knowing this i have too sincere a love for my country to undertake that which may tend to the prejudice of it but if i could entertain hopes that you thought me worthy of the post of lieutenantcolonel and would favor me so far as to mention it at the appointment of officers i could not but entertain a true sense of the kindness i flatter myself that under a skilful commander or man of sense whom i most sincerely wish to serve under with my own application and diligent study of my duty i shall be able to conduct my steps without censure and in time render myself worthy of the promotion that i shall be favored with now  george washington  0 march      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria  0 march      sir i was favored with your letter by mr stewart enclosing a lieutenantcolonels commission  and i    hope my future behaviour will sufficiently testify the true sense i have of this kindness at present there are about seventyfive men at alexandria near fifty of whom i have enlisted the others have been sent by messrs polson mercer and waggener  to this place very few officers have repaired hither yet which has occasioned a fatiguing time to me in managing a number of selfwilled ungovernable people i shall implicitly obey your commands and march out with all expedition major carlyle is now preparing wagons for the conveyance of provisions which till now could not move on account of the heavy roads i doubt not but your honor has been informed before this of mr vanbraams ill success in augusta by the express who was sent from thence for that purpose  major muses promotion and messrs rose and bentlys declining will occasion a want of officers in which case i would beg leave to mention mr vanbraam for a command who is the oldest lieutenant and an experienced soldier unless the officers come in i shall be obliged to appoint him to that office till i have your honors further directions it would be conferring a very great obligation on him were you to confirm the appointment i verily believe his behaviour would not render him displeasing to you i have given captain stephen orders to be    in readiness to join us at winchester with his company as they were already in that neighbourhood and raised there i have nothing further to add at present but my sincere thanks for the indulgent favors i have met with and i am your honors most obedient c  journal marchapril      to preserve the continuity of the story i have embodied such of washingtons letters as written during his march to the ohio into a translation of a journal which the french captured at fort necessity this journal is incomplete and is not printed as washington wrote it as the original is lost and the only form in which it is accessible is through a french translation and faulty renderings into english from that translation to defend its position for no formal declaration of war had yet been made and to prove the english to be the aggressors the french government published this journal and other papers found at fort necessity together with a number of state and private instructions and reports in mémoire contenant le précis des faits avec leurs pièces justicatives pour servir de résponse aux observations envoyées par les ministres dangleterre dans les cours de leurope      it has been many times reprinted in english but as sparks says the translation is uncouth in its style and faulty in its attempts to convey the sense of the original i have compared the following with the french and believe it to be the most accurate translation yet made on the   st march i received from his honour a lieutenant colonels commission in the virginia regiment whereof joshua fry esquire was colonel dated the   th with orders to take the troops which were at that time quartered at alexandria under my command and to march with them towards the ohio there to aid captain trent in building forts and in defending the possessions of his majesty against the attempts and hostilities of the french     april the  d every thing being ready we began our march according to our orders the  d of april with two companies of foot commanded by captain peter hog and lieutenant jacob vanbraam five subalterns two sergeants six corporals one drummer and one hundred and twenty soldiers one surgeon one swedish gentleman who was a volunteer two wagons guarded by one lieutenant sergeant corporal and twentyfive soldiers we left alexandria on tuesday noon and encamped about four miles from cameron  having travelled six miles from the  d of april to the   th of said month this journal contains only the march of the troops and union with a detachment which was brought by captain stephen the   th we met an express who had letters from captain trent at the ohio demanding a reinforcement with all possible speed as he hourly expected a body of eight hundred french i tarried at job pearsalls for the arrival of the troops where they came the next day when i received the above express i despatched a messenger to colonel fry to give him notice of it the  0th i came to the house of colonel cresap to dispose the detachment and on my route had notice that the fort was taken by the french two days later that news was confirmed by mr ward the ensign of captain trent who had been obliged to surrender to a body of more than one thousand french under the command of captain contrecœur who came from venango in french presqu isle with sixty battoes and three hundred canoes and eighteen pieces of artillery which were set up against the fort contrecœur afterwards sent him a summons to withdraw mr ward also informed me that the indians remained always steadfastly attached to our interest he brought with him two young indians of the mingo nation that they might have the satisfaction of seeing that we were marching with troops to their succour    he also delivered me the following speech which the halfking sent to me fortohio april   th      a speech from the halfking escruniat and collier for the governors of virginia and pennsylvania my brethren the english the bearer will inform you how we have been treated by the french we waited a long time thinking they would come and attack us we now see how they wish to use us we are now ready to fall upon them waiting only for your assistance take courage and come as soon as possible you will find us as ready to fight as you are yourselves we have sent these two young men to see if you are ready to come and if so they are to return to us to let us know where you are that we may join you we should be glad if the troops belonging to the two provinces could meet together in the fort which is in the way  if you do not soon come to our assistance we are intirely undone and i think we shall never meet again i say it with a heart full of grief a belt of wampum the halfking addressed me personally the following speech i am ready if you think it proper to go to both the governors with these two young men for i have no longer any dependence on those who have been gone so long without returning or sending any message a belt of wampum april   d a council of war held at willscreek to consult upon the news brought by mr ward upon a review of the news brought by ensign ward the summons of captain contrecœur commander of the french troops and the speeches of the halfking and other chiefs of the six nations it appeared that mr ward was forced to surrender the said fort the   th instant to the french who were above one thousand strong and had eighteen pieces of artillery some of which were nine pounders and also that the detachment of the virginia regiment amounting to one hundred and fifty men commanded    by colonel washington had orders to reinforce captain trents company and that the aforesaid garrison consisted only of thirtythree effective men it was thought impracticable to march towards the fort without sufficient strength and being strongly urged by the indians and particularly by the speeches of the halfking the president gave his opinion that it would be proper to advance as far as redstonecreek in french the creek de la roche rouge  on monongahela in french mahengueulé about thirtyseven miles on this side of the fort and to raise a fortification clearing a road broad enough to pass with our artillery and our baggage and there to await fresh orders this opinion was accepted for the following reasons  st that the mouth of redstone is the first convenient place on the river monongahela  d that magazines there for the stores of the company are ready to receive our ammunition  supplies and our heavy artillery may be sent by water whenever it was agreed to attack the fort  d further that will preserve our troops from the evil consequences of inaction and encourage our allies the indians to remain in our interests whereupon i determined to send mr ward to the governor with one of the young indians and an interpreter i thought proper also to acquaint the governors of maryland and pennsylvania with the news and i sent away the other indian to the halfking with the speeches inclosed in the following letter george washington    april      wills creek horatio sharpe to horatio sharpe governor of maryland wills creek    april      may it please your excellency it is with the greatest concern i acquaint you that mr ward ensign in captain trents company was  0 obliged to surrender his small fortress in the forks of monongahela at the summons of captain contrecœur commander of the french forces who fell down from venango with a fleet of   0 canoes and battoes conveying upwards of one thousand men eighteen pieces of artillery and large stores of provisions and other necessaries—mr ward having but an inconsiderable number of men not exceeding  0 and no cannon to make a proper defence was forced to give up the fort on the   th instant—they suffered him to draw out his men arms and working tools and gave leave that he might retreat to the inhabitants with them i have heard of your excellencys great zeal for his majestys service and for all our interests on the present occasion therefore i am persuaded you will take proper notice of the indians moving speech and think their unshaken fidelity worthy your consideration  i have arrived thus far with a detachment of     men col fry with the remainder of the regiments and artillery is daily expected in the mean time we shall advance slowly across the mountains making the roads as we march fit for the carriage of the great guns c and are designed to proceed as far as the mouth of red stone creek which enters the monongahela about    miles above the fort the french have taken from whence we have water carriage down the river there is a store house built by the ohio company at the place which for the present may serve as a receptacle for our ammunition and provisions     besides the french herein mentioned we have credible information that another party are coming up ohio we also have intelligence that  00 of the chippoways and ottoway indians are marching down scioto creek to join them i ought first to have begged pardon of your excellency for this liberty of writing as i am not happy enough to be ranked among those of your acquaintance it was the glowing zeal i owe my country that influenced me to impart these advices and my inclination prompted me to do it to you as i know you are solicitous for the public weal and warm in this interesting cause—that should rouse from the lethargy we have fallen into the heroick spirit of every freeborn english man to attest the rights and privileges of our king if we dont consult the benefit of ourselves and resque from the invasions of a usurping enemy our majestys property his dignity and land i hope sir you will excuse the freeness of my expressions they are the pure sentiments of the heart of him who is with all imaginable regard and due respect c n b—i herewith have enclosed for your excellencys perusal a copy of the summons from the    french officers and also the indians speech which was delivered to and brought by mr ward george washington    april      wills creek governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie wills creek    april      honble sir captain trents ensign mr ward has this day arrived from the fork of the monongahela and brings the disagreeable account that the fort on the   th instant was surrendered at the summons of monsieur contrecœur to a body of french consisting of upwards of one thousand men who came from venango with eighteen pieces of cannon sixty batteaux and three hundred canoes they gave him liberty to bring off all his men and workingtools which he accordingly did the same day     immediately upon this information i called a council of war to advise on proper measures to be taken in this exigency a copy of their resolves with the proceedings i herewith enclose by the bearer whom i have continued express to your honor for more minute intelligence mr ward has the summons with him and a speech from the halfking which i also enclose with the wampum he is accompanied by one of the indians mentioned therein who were sent to see where we were what was our strength and to know the time to expect us out the other young man i have prevailed upon to return to the halfking with the following speech sachems warriors of the six united nations shawanese and delawares our friends and brethren i received your speech by the bucks brother mr ward who came to us with the two young men five sleeps after leaving you we return you thanks from hearts glowing with affection for your steadfast adherence to us for your kind speech and for your wise counsels and directions to the bucks brother the young man will inform you where he met a small part of our army advancing towards you clearing the road for a great number of our warriors who are immediately to follow with our great guns our ammunition and our provisions i could not delay to let you know our hearts and have sent back one of the young men with this speech to acquaint you with them i have sent the other according to your desire to the    governor of virginia with the bucks brother to deliver your speech and wampum and to be an eyewitness of the preparations we are making to come in haste to support you whose interest is as dear to us as our lives we resent the usage of the treacherous french and our conduct will henceforth plainly show you how much we have it at heart i cannot be easy without seeing you before our forces meet at the fork of the roads and therefore i have the greatest desire that you and escruniat or one of you should meet me on the road as soon as possible to assist us in council to assure you of the good will we bear you and to confirm the truth of what has been said i herewith present to you a string of wampum that you may thereby remember how much i am your brother and friend  i hope my proceedings in these affairs will be satisfactory to your honor as i have to the utmost of my knowledge consulted the interest of the expedition and good of my country whose rights while they are asserted in so just a cause i will defend to the last remains of life hitherto the difficulties i have met with in marching    have been greater than i expect to encounter on the ohio when possibly i may be surrounded by the enemy and these difficulties have been occasioned by those who had they acted as becomes every good subject would have exerted their utmost abilities to forward our just designs out of seventyfour wagons impressed at winchester we got but ten after waiting a week and some of those so badly provided with teams that the soldiers were obliged to assist them up the hills although it was known they had better teams at home i doubt not that in some points i may have strained the law but i hope as my sole motive was to expedite the march i shall be supported in it should my authority be questioned which at present i do not apprehend unless some busybody intermeddles  your honor will see by the resolves in council that i am destined to the monongahela with all the diligent despatch in my power we will endeavour to make the road sufficiently good for the heaviest artillery to pass and when we arrive at redstone creek fortify ourselves as strongly as the short time will allow i doubt not that we can maintain a possession there till we are reinforced unless the rising of    the waters shall admit the enemys cannon to be conveyed up in canoes and then i flatter myself we shall not be so destitute of intelligence as not to get timely notice of it and make a good retreat i hope you will see the absolute necessity for our having as soon as our forces are collected a number of cannon some of heavy metal with mortars and grenadoes to attack the french and put us on an equal footing with them perhaps it may also be thought advisable to invite the cherokees catawbas and chickasaws to march to our assistance as we are informed that six hundred chippewas and ottawas are marching down scioto creek to join the french who are coming up the ohio in that case i would beg leave to recommend their being ordered to this place first that a peace may be concluded between them and the six nations for i am informed by several persons that as no good harmony subsists between them their coming first to the ohio may create great disorders and turn out much to our disadvantage as i had opportunities i wrote to the governors of maryland and pennsylvania acquainting them with these advices and enclosed the summons and indian speech which i hope you will not think me too forward in doing i considered that the assembly of maryland was to sit in five days that the pennsylvania assembly is now sitting and that by giving timely notice something might be done in favor of this expedition which now requires all the force we can muster    by the best information i can get i much doubt whether any of the indians will be in to treat in may are the indian women and children if they settle amongst us to be maintained at our expense they will expect it  this day arrived the men belonging to captain trent who by your orders had been inlisted as militiatroops the officers having imprudently promised them two shillings per day they now refuse to serve for less pay ward shall receive your orders on that head april    some pieces of cannon reached us which were taken to the mouth of pattersons river from the   th of april to the   th of may the journal deals only with marches and matters of little consequence george washington   may      little meadows governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie little meadows   may      honble sir i acquainted you by mr ward with the determination which we prosecuted in four days after his departure as soon as wagons arrived to carry our provisions the want of proper conveyances has much retarded this expedition and at this time unfortunately delayd the detachment i have the honour to command even when we came to wills creek my disappointments were not less than before for there i expected to have found a sufficient number    of packhorses provided by captain trent conformable to his promise in reply to major carlyles letters and my own that i might prosecute my first intention with light expeditious marches but instead of that there was none in readiness nor any in expectation that i could perceive which reduced me to the necessity of waiting till wagons could be procured from the branch forty miles distant however in the mean time i detached a party of sixty men to make and amend the road which party since ye   th of april and the main body since the  st instant have been laboriously employed and have got no further than these meadows about twenty miles from the new store where we have been two days making a bridge across and are not done yet the great difficulty and labor that it requires to amend and alter the road prevents our marching above     or   miles a day and i fear tho no diligence shall be neglected we shall be detained some considerable time before it can be made good for the carriage of the artillery with colonel fry we daily receive intelligence from ohio by one or other of the traders that are continually retreating to the inhabitants with their effects they all concur that ye french are reinforced with  00 men and this day by one kalender i received an account which he sets forth as certain that there is  00 men building at the falls of ohio from whence they intend to move up to the lower shawnee town at ye mouth of sciodo creek to erect other fortresses he likewise says that these forces at ye forks are erecting    their works with their whole force and as he was coming met at mr gists new settlement monsieur la force with   soldiers who under the specious pretence of hunting deserters were reconnoitering and discovering ye country he also brings ye agreeable news that the halfking has received and is much pleased with the speech i sent them and is now upon their march with  0 men to meet us the french down the river are sending presents and invitations to all the neighbouring indians and practising every means to influence them in their interest we have heard nothing from the catawbas or any of the southern indians tho this is the time we mostly need their assistance i have not above   0 effective men with me since captain trents have left us who i discharged from this detachment and ordered them to wait your honours command at captain trents for i found them rather injurious to ye other men than serviceable to ye expedition till they could be upon the same establishment with us and come under the regt of the martial law may the   th i detached a party of twentyfive men commanded by captain stephen and ensign peyronie with orders to go to mr gists to enquire exactly where la force and his party were and in case they were in the neighborhood to cease pursuit and protect themselves i also ordered them to examine closely all the woods round about and should they find any frenchman apart from the rest to try to capture him and bring him in that we might obtain intelligence to make careful inquiry if it was possible to descend by water as also to find out some convenient  0 place near the mouth of redstone creek where we could build a fort to salute the halfking and to send him back under a small guard as also to enquire what were the views and designs of the french what they had done and what they intended to do and to collect every thing which could give us the least intelligence the   th broke camp and went on a rising ground where we halted to dry ourselves for we had been obliged to ford a rapid where our shortest men had water up to their armpits an express came in with letters acquainting us that colonel fry with a detachment of more than one hundred men was at winchester and was to set out in a few days to join us as also that colonel innes was marching with three hundred and fifty men raised in carolina that it was expected maryland would raise two hundred men and that pennsylvania had raised ten thousand pounds equal to about fiftytwo thousand five hundred livres to pay the soldiers of other colonies as that province could furnish no recruits and that governor shirley had sent six hundred men to harrass the french in canada i hope that will give them some work to do and will moderate their zeal in sending so many men to the ohio the   th met two traders who told us they were retiring for fear of the french as parties of them were often seen around mr gists these traders are of opinion as well as many others that it is not possible to clear a road for any loaded wagon to go from hence to redstonecreek the   th this evening mr ward arrived with the young indian returning from williamsburg and delivered me a letter wherein the governor is so good as to approve of my proceedings but is much displeased with captain trent and has ordered him to be tried for leaving his men at the ohio with these orders the governor also informs me that captain mackay with an independent company of one hundred men besides the officers had arrived and    that we might expect them daily and that the men from new york would join us within ten days  this evening also came two indians from the ohio who had left the french fort five days ago they relate that the french forces are all employed in building their fort which is already breasthigh and the thickness of two fathoms and filled up with earth and stone c they have cut down and burnt all the trees which were about it and sown grain in their place they say themselves they are eight hundred the indians believe there were only six hundred in number they expect a greater number in a few days which will make them one thousand six hundred strong and then they say they can defy the english the   th the waters continuing very high hindered me from marching my men and baggage which determined me to place myself in a posture of defence against any immediate attack from the enemy and to go myself down to observe the river george washington    may      great crossing of the youghiogany governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie great crossing of the youghiogany    may      sir i received your honors favor by mr ward who arrived here last night just as two indians from the ohio did which indians contradict the report of the french having received reinforcements though they agree that eight hundred men are very shortly expected those that are there are busily employed in erecting the fort which they have removed to the point i recommended for the countrys use whose walls they have now made two fathoms thick and have raised it breast high they are daily sending scouts out some of which about five days ago was seen within six or seven    miles of our camp but as i did not receive timely notice of it they have escaped unless they have fallen in with a party sent out about   days ago to redstone creek to reconnoitre the country thereabouts and to get intelligence of the motions of the french it is imagined the halfking will be here in two or three days but to hurry him i have sent the indian that came up with mr ward with a short speech acquainting him with my desire of his coming as expeditiously as possible to receive the speech which your honour sent by mr ward and that colonel fry wrote me i was to deliver when he arrives i will endeavour to send him on to meet your honour at winchester these indians and all the traders that i have been able to get any information from of late agree that it is almost impracticable to open a road that a wagon can pass from this to redstone creek but most of them assure me that except one place water carriage may be had down this river which will be a most advantageous discovery if it proves so as it will save  0 miles land carriage over almost impassable roads and mountains the water is now so high that we cannot possibly cross over with our men which likewise secures us from any immediate attacks of the enemy therefore i have resolved to go down the river to this fall which is at the turkey foot to inform myself concerning the nature and difficulty attending this fall in order thereto i have provided a canoe and shall with an officer and   men set out upon this discovery tomorrow morning    captain trents men who by their refractory behaviour did oblige me to separate them from the other soldiers have now left the new store and dispersed contrary to my positive orders till they received your honours commands as i shall have frequent communications with the indians which is of no effect without wampum i hope your honour will order some to be sent indeed we ought to have spirit and many other things of this sort which is always expected by every indian that brings a message or good report also the chiefs who visit and converse in council look for it if it would not be thought too bold in me i would recommend some of the treaty goods being sent for that purpose with or after colonel fry this is the method the french pursue and a trifle judiciously bestowed and in season may turn to our advantage if i find this river is navigable i am convinced it can but be agreeable to your honour building canoes in order to convey our artillery down as the road to this place is made as good as it can be having spent much time and great labor upon it i believe wagons may travel now with   00 or   00 weight on them by doubling the teams at one or two pinches only george washington    may      great crossing of the youghiogany governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie great crossing of the youghiogany    may      honble sir i am heartily concerned that the officers have such real cause to complain of the committees resolves    and still more to find my inclinations prone to second their just grievances i have endeavoured as far as i was able to see in the best light i could the trifling advantages that may accrue yet nothing prevents their throwing down their commissions with gratitude and thanks to your honor whose good intentions of serving us we are all well assured of but the approaching danger which has too far engaged their honor to recede till other officers are sent in their room or an alteration made regarding their pay during which time they will assist with their best endeavours voluntarily—that is without receiving the gratuity allowed by the resolves of the committee giving up my commission is quite contrary to my intention nay i ask it as a greater favor than any amongst the many i have received from your honor to confirm it to me but let me serve voluntarily then i will with the greatest pleasure in life devote my services to the expedition without any other reward than the satisfaction of serving my country but to be slaving dangerously for the shadow of pay through woods rocks mountains—i would rather prefer the great toil of a daily laborer and dig for a maintenance provided i were reduced to the necessity than serve upon such ignoble terms for i really do not see why the lives of his majestys subjects in virginia should be of less value than of those in other parts of his american dominions especially when it is well known that we must undergo double their hardship i could enumerate a thousand difficulties that we    have met with and must expect to meet with more than other officers who have almost double our pay but as i know you reflect on these things and are sensible of the hardships we must necessarily encounter it would be needless to enlarge besides as i have expatiated fully and perhaps too warmly in a letter to colonel fairfax who i suppose will accompany you to winchester upon the motives that occasion these my resolves i shall not trouble you with them for the subject leads me too far when i engage in it  another thing resolved by the committee is that only one sergeant and one corporal be allowed to a company with whom it is as much impossible to do the necessary duty as it is to conquer kingdoms with my handful of men upon the whole i find so many clogs upon the expedition that i quite despair of success nevertheless i humbly beg it as a particular favor that your honor will continue me in the post i now enjoy the duty whereof i will most cheerfully execute as a volunteer but by no means upon the present pay    i hope what i have said will not be taken amiss for i really believe were it as much in your power as it is your inclination we should be treated as gentlemen and officers and not have annexed to the most trifling pay that ever was given to english officers the glorious allowance of soldiers diet—a pound of pork with bread in proportion per day be the consequence what it will i am determined not to leave the regiment but to be amongst the last men that quit the ohio even if i serve as a private volunteer which i greatly prefer to the establishment we are now upon i am c  the   th i dispatched the young indian who had returned with mr ward to the halfking with the following speech george washington john davison to the halfking c my brethren it gives me great pleasure to learn that you are marching to assist me with your counsels be of good courage my brethren and march vigorously towards your brethren the english for they come with new forces who will protect you against your treacherous enemy the french my friends whom i send to you will acquaint you of an agreeable speech which the governor of    virginia addresses to you he is very sorry for the bad usage you have received the great waters do not permit us to go as promptly to you as we would for that reason i have sent the young man to invite you to come and meet us he can tell you many things which he has seen in virginia and also how well he was received by the most influential they did not use them as the french do your people who go to their fort they refuse them provisions this man has had given him all that his heart could wish for the confirmation of all this i here give you a belt of wampum the  0th embarked in a canoe with lieutenant west three soldiers and one indian and having followed the river about half a mile we were obliged to come ashore where i met peter suver a trader who seemed to discourage me from seeking a passage by water that induced me to alter the intention of building canoes i ordered my people to wade as the waters were shallow enough and continued myself down the river and finding that our canoes were too small for six men we stopped to make some sort of a boat with which together with our canoes we gained turkeyfoot in french le pied de ginge by the beginning of night we encountered several little difficulties about eight or ten miles from thence of no great consequence finding the waters sometimes deep enough for canoes to pass and at other times more shallow the   st we passed some time in examining the place which we found very convenient for locating a fort being at the mouth of three branches and for the most part affording a good foundation of tufa tuf the plan which may be here seen is as exact as i could make it without mathematical instruments we went about two miles to observe the course of the river which is very strait has many currents is full of rocks and rapid we waded it though the water was pretty high which made me think it would not be difficult to pass it with canoes which could be done now only with difficulty    besides this rapid we found others the water being more shallow and the current smoother we easily passed them but afterwards we found little or scarce any bottom mountains lie on both sides of the river we descended the river about ten miles when a great rapid obliged us to stop and to come ashore from the   d to the   th the journal contains only a description of the country george washington    may      joshua fry to colonel joshua fry    may      sir this day i returned from my discoveries down the youghiogany which i am sorry to say can never be made navigable we traced the watercourse near thirty miles with the full expectation of succeeding in the much desired aim but at length we came to a fall which continued rough rocky and scarcely passable for two miles and then fell within the space of fifty yards nearly forty feet perpendicular as i apprehended there would be difficulty in these waters i sent the soldiers forward upon the road when i left the camp which was as soon as they could cross therefore no time has been lost but the roads are so exceedingly bad that we proceed very slow by concurring intelligence which we received from the indians the french are not above seven or eight hundred strong and by a late account we are informed that one half of them were detached in the night without even the indians knowledge on some secret expedition but the truth of this though it is affirmed by an indian lately from their fort i cannot yet vouch for nor tell where they are bound    i would recommend in the strongest terms possible your writing to the governor for some of the treaty goods or any others suitable for the indians nothing can be done without them all the indians that come expect presents the french take this method which proves very acceptable besides if you want one or more to conduct a party to discover the country to hunt or for any particular service they must be bought their friendship is not so warm as to prompt them to these services gratis and that i believe every person who is acquainted with the nature of indians knows the indian that accompanied me down the river would go no further than the forks about ten miles till i promised him a ruffled shirt which i must take from my own and a matchcoat he said the french always had indians to show them the woods because they paid well for so doing and this may be laid down as a standing maxim amongst them i think were the goods sent out and delivered occasionally as you see cause that four or five hundred pounds worth would do more good than as many thousands given at a treaty i hope i may be excused for offering my opinions so freely for i can aver we shall get no intelligence or other services from them unless we have goods to apply to these uses i am c the   th this morning an indian arrived in company with the young indian i had sent to the halfking and brought me the following letter from him george washington john davison to the forist his majesties commander offwerses—to hom this may concern  0 on acct of a french armey to meat mister georg wassionton therfor my brotheres i deisir you to beawar of them for deisind to strik ye forist englsh they see ten deays since they marchd i cannot tell what nomber the half king and the rest of the chiefs will be with you in five dayes to consel no more at present but give my serves to my brothers the english the halfking john davison i examined those two young indians as best i could concerning every circumstance but they did not give me much information they say there are parties of them often out but they do not know of any considerable number coming this way the french continue raising their fort that part next to the land is very well inclosed but that next to the water is much neglected at least is without any defence they have only nine pieces of cannon some of them very small and not one mounted there are two on the point and the others at some distance from the fort on the land side they say that there are many sick among them that they cannot find any indians to guide their small parties towards our camp these indians having refused the same day at two oclock we arrived at the meadows where we saw a trader who told us that he had come that morning from mr gists where he had seen two frenchmen the night before and that he knew there was a strong detachment on the march which confirmed the account we had received from the halfking consequently i placed troops behind two natural intrenchments where i also placed our waggons the   th detached one party  to go along the roads and other small parties into the woods to reconnoitre i gave the horsemen orders to examine the country well    and endeavour to get some news of the french of their forces and of their movements c— at night all these parties returned without having discovered any thing though they had been a great way towards the place from whence it was said the party was coming the   th arrived william jenkins he had come express from colonel fry with a letter from colonel fairfax which informed me that the governor himself as also colonels corbin and ludwell were arrived at winchester and were desirous to see the halfking there whereupon i sent him a message george washington    may      great meadows governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie great meadows    may      honble sir the   th ultimo by an express from colonel fry i received ye news of your honours arrival at winchester and advice of seeing the halfking and other chiefs of the   nations i have by sundry speeches and messages invited him monacatoocha c to meet me and have reason to expect he is on his road as he only purposed to settle his people to planting at a place up yaughyaughgany chosen for the purpose but fearing something might have retarded his march i immediately upon the arrival of the express despatched a messenger with a speech he is not returned yet about four days ago i received a message from ye halfking of which the following is a copy exactly taken —       this account was received in the evening by another man the french were at the crossing of    youghiogany about eighteen miles distant i hereupon hurried to this place as a convenient spot we have with natures assistance made a good entrenchment and by clearing ye bushes out of these meadows prepared a charming field for an encounter i detached immediately upon my arrival here small light partys of horse wagon horses to reconnoitre the enemy and discover their strength and motion who returned yesterday without seeing any thing of them nevertheless we were alarmed at night and remained under arms from two oclock till near sunrise we conceive it was our own men as six of them deserted but cant be certain whether it was they or other enemies be it as it will they were fired at by the sentries but i believe without damage this morning mr gist arrived from his place where a detachment of fifty men were seen yesterday at noon commanded by m la force he afterwards saw these march within five miles of our camp i immediately detached seventyfive men in pursuit of them who i hope will overtake them before they get to redstone creek where their canoes lie mr gist being an eyewitness of our proceedings hereupon and waiting for this without my knowing till just now that he intended to wait upon your honour obliges me to refer to him for particulars as i expect my messenger tonight from the halfking i shall write more fully tomorrow by the express that came from colonel fry but before i conclude i must take the liberty of mentioning to your honor the great necessity there is for having goods out here to give for services to    the indians they are expected and refuse to scout or do any thing without saying these services are paid well by the french i really think were   or  00 pounds worth of proper goods sent it would tend more to our interest than so many thousands given in a lump at a treaty i have been obliged to pay spirits for what they have already done which i cannot continue to do the numbers of the french have been greatly magnified as your honour may see by a copy of the enclosed journal who i sent out to gain intelligence i have received letters from the governors of pennsylvania and maryland copies of which i also send p s i hope your honor will excuse the haste with which i was obliged to use in writing this the   th mr gist arrived early in the morning who told us that mr la force with fifty men whose tracks he had seen five miles off had been at his plantation the day before towards noon and would have killed a cow and broken every thing in the house if two indians whom he had left in the house had not perswaded them from their design i immmediately detached sixtyfive men under command of captain hog lieutenant mercer ensign peyronie three sergeants and three corporals with instructions the french enquired at mr gists what was become of the halfking i did not fail to let the young indians who were in our camp know that the french wanted to kill the halfking and that had its desired effect  upon the spot they offered to accompany our people against the french and had they found it true that he had been killed or even insulted by them one of them would have promptly    carried the news to the mingo town and incited their warriors to fall upon them one of these young men was sent towards mr gists and should he not find the halfking there he was to send a message by a delaware about eight at night received an express from the halfking which informed me that as he was coming to join us he had seen along the road the tracks of two men which he had followed till he was brought to a low obscure place where he thought the whole party of french was hidden that very moment i sent out forty men and ordered my ammunition to be concealed fearing a stratagem of the french to attack our camp i left a guard to defend it and with the rest of my men set out in a heavy rain and in a night as dark as pitch  along a path scarce broad enough for one man we were sometime fifteen or twenty minutes out of the path before we could come to it again and so dark that we would often strike one against another all night long we continued our march and the   th about sunrise we arrived at the indian camp where after holding a council with the halfking it was concluded to attack them together so we sent out two men to discover where they were and in what position and what sort of ground was thereabout after which we formed ourselves for surrounding them and took up our march one after the other in the indian manner we were advanced pretty near to them as we thought when they discovered us whereupon i ordered my company to fire mine was supported by that of mr waggener and my company and his received the whole fire of the french during the greatest part of the action which only lasted a quarter of an hour before the enemy was routed     we killed mr de jumonville the commander of that party with nine others we wounded one and made twentyone prisoners among whom were m la force m drouillon and two cadets the indians scalped the dead and took most of their arms after which we marched with the prisoners and the guard to the indian camp where again i held a council with the halfking and there informed him that the governor was desirous to see him and was waiting for him at winchester he answered that he could not go just then as his people were in too imminent a danger from the french whom they had just attacked that he must send messengers to all the allied nations inviting them to take up the hatchet he sent a young delaware indian to the delaware nation and gave him also a french scalp to carry to them this man wished to have a part of the presents which were allotted for them and that the remaining part might be kept for another opportunity he proposed to go to his own family and to several others and conduct them to mr gists where he desired men and horses should be sent to aid them to reach our camp after this i marched on with the prisoners they had informed me that they had been sent with a summons to order me to depart—a plausible pretence to discover our camp and to obtain a knowledge of our forces and our situation it was so clear that they were come to reconnoitre that i admired at their assurance in telling me that they were come as an embassy for their instructions mentioned that they should get what knowledge they could of the roads rivers and of all the country as far as potowmack and instead of coming as an embassador publicly and in an open manner they came most secretly and sought after the most hidden retreats more fit for deserters than an embassador in such retreats they encamped and remained hid for whole days together being no more than five miles from us from thence they sent spies to reconnoitre our camp the whole force retraced their steps two miles they sent the two messengers    spoken of in the instruction to acquaint m de contrecœur of the place we were in and of our disposition that he might send his detachments to inforce the summons as soon as it should be given besides it was a suite worthy of a prince that this ambassador had whereas he was merely a petty french officer an embassador has no need of spies his character being always sacred and since their intention was so good why did they tarry two days five miles from us without acquainting me with the summons or at least with something that related to the embassy that alone would be sufficient to raise the strongest suspicions and we ought to do them the justice to say that wishing to hide themselves they could not pick out better places than they had done the summons is so insolent and savors so much of gasconnade that had it been brought openly by two men it was too great an indulgence to have suffered them to return it was the opinion of the halfking in this case that their intentions were evil and that it was a pure pretence that they never intended to come to us but as enemies and if we had been so foolish as to let them go they would never help us more to take other frenchmen they pretend they called to us as soon as they had discovered us it is absolutely false for i was then marching at the head of the company and can positively affirm that as soon as they saw us they ran to their arms without calling as i must have heard them had they so done george washington    may      great meadows governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie from our camp at the great meadows    may      honble sir in answering your honors letter of ye   th by mr burney  i shall begin with assuring you that nothing    was farther from my intention than to recede tho i then pressed and still desire that my services may be voluntary rather than on the present pay i am much concerned that your honour should seem to charge me with ingratitude for your generous and my undeserved favours for i assure you honble sir nothing is a greater stranger to my breast or a sin that my soul more abhors than that black and detestable one ingratitude i retain a true sense of your kindnesses and want nothing but opportunity to give testimony of my willingness to oblige as far as my life or fortune will extend i could not object to the pay before i knew it i dare say your honour remembers the first estimation allowed a lieutenantcolonel    shillings and a major   s  d which i then complained very much of till your honour assured me that we were to be furnished with proper necessary and offered that as a reason why the pay was less than british  after this when you were so kind as to prefer me to the command i now have and at the same time acquainted me that i was to have but   s  d this with some other reasons induced me to acquaint colonel fairfax with my intention of resigning which he must well remember as it happened at bellhaven  and it was there that he dissuaded me from it and promised    to represent the trifling pay to your honour who would endeavour as i at the same time told him that the speaker thought the officers pay too small to have it enlarged as to the numbers that applied for commissions and to whom we were preferred i believe had those gentlemen been as knowing of this country and as sensible of the difficulties that would attend a campaign here as i then was i conceive your honour would not have been so troublesomely solicited as you were yet i do not offer this as a reason for quitting the service for my own part i can answer i have a constitution hardy enough to encounter and undergo the most severe trials and i flatter myself resolution to face what any man durst as shall be proved when it comes to the test which i believe we are on the borders of there is nothing sir i believe more certain than that the officers on the canada expedition had british pay allowed whilst they were in the service  lieutenant waggener captain trent and several others whom i have conversed with on the head and who were engaged in it affirm it for truth therefore honble sir as this cant be allowed suffer me to    serve as a volunteer which i assure you will be the next reward to british pay for as my services so far as i have knowledge will equal those of the best officer i make it a point of honor not to serve for less and accept a medium nevertheless i have communicated your honors sentiments to them and as far as i could put on the hypocrite set forth the advantages that may accrue and advised them to accept the terms as a refusal might reflect dishonor on their character leaving it to the world to assign what reasons they please for their quitting the service i am very sensible of the pernicious consequences that will attend their resigning as they have by this gained some experience of the military art have a tolerable knowledge of the country being sent most of them out at different times with parties and are now accustomed to the hardships and fatigues of living as we do which i believe were it truly stated would prevent your honour from many troublesome solicitations from others for commissions this last motive has and will induce me to do what i can to reconcile matters tho i really believe there are some that will not remain long without an alteration they have promised to consider of it and give your honour an answer i was not ignorant of the allowance which colonel fry  has for his table but being a dependent there myself deprived me of the pleasure  0 of inviting an officer or friend which to me would be more agreeable than the nicknacks i shall meet with there and here i cannot forbear answering one thing more in your honours letter on this head which too is more fully expressed in a paragraph of colonel fairfaxs to me as follows—if on the british establishment officers are allowed more pay the regimentals they are obliged annually to furnish their necessary table and other incidents being considered little or no savings will be their portion i believe it is well known we have been at the expense of regimentals and it is still better known that regimentals and every other necessary that we were under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this expedition were not to be bought for less virginia currency than british officers could get for sterling money which they ought to have been to put upon a parity in this respect then colonel fairfax observes that their table and other incident charges prevent them from saving much if they dont save much they have the enjoyment of their pay which we neither have in one sense nor the other we are debarred the pleasure of good living which sir i dare say with me you will concur to one who has always been used to it must go somewhat hard to be confined to a little salt provision and water and do duty hard laborious duty that is almost inconsistent with that of a soldier and yet the same reductions as if we were allowed luxuriously my pay according to the british establishment and    common exchange is near   s per day in the room of that ye committee for i cant in ye least imagine your honour had any hand in it has provided   s  d so long as ye service requires me whereas one half of ye other is ascertained to british officers forever now if we should be fortunate enough to drive the french from ohio as far as your honour would please to have them sent to in any short time our pay will not be sufficient to discharge our first expenses i would not have your honour imagine from this that i have said all these things to have the pay increased but to justify myself and shew your honour that our complaints are not frivolous but are founded upon strict reason for my own part it is a matter almost indifferent whether i serve for full pay or as a generous volunteer indeed did my circumstances correspond with my inclination i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter for the motives that lead me here were pure and noble i had no view of acquisition but that of honour by serving faithfully my king and country as your honour has recommended mr willis you may depend i shall with pleasure do all that i can for him but above all sir you may depend i shall take all possible means of procuring intelligence and guarding against surprises and be assured nothing but very unequal numbers shall engage me to submit or retreat now sir as i have answered your honours letter i shall beg leave to acquaint you with what has happened since i wrote by mr gist    i then acquainted you that i had detached a party of seventyfive men to meet fifty of the french who we had intelligence were upon their march towards us to reconnoitre and that about nine oclock the same night i received an express from the halfking who was encamped with several of his people about six miles off that he had seen the tracks of two frenchmen crossing the road and believed the whole body were lying not far off as he had an account of that number passing mr gists i set out with forty men before ten and it was from that time till near sunrise before we reached the indians camp having marched in a small path through a heavy rain and night as dark as it is possible to conceive we were frequently tumbling one over another and often so lost that fifteen or twenty minutes search would not find the path again when we came to the halfking i counselled with him and got his assent to go handinhand and strike the french accordingly himself monacatoocha and a few other indians set out with us and when we came to the place where the tracks were the halfking sent two indians to follow their tracks and discover their lodgement which they did about half a mile from the road in a very obscure place surrounded with rocks i thereupon in conjunction with the halfking and monacatoocha formed a disposition to attack them on all sides which we accordingly did and after an engagement of about fifteen minutes we killed ten wounded one and took twentyone prisoners amongst those that were    killed was monsieur jumonville the commander principal officers taken is monsieur drouillon and monsr la force who your honour has often heard me speak of as a bold enterprising man and a person of great subtlety and cunning with these are two cadets  these officers pretend they were coming on an embassy but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring as your honour will see by the instructions and summons enclosed these instructions were to reconnoitre the country roads creeks c to potomack which they were about to do these enterprising men were purposely choose out to get intelligence which they were to send back by some brisk despatches with mention of the day that they were to serve the summons which could be through no other view than to get a sufficient reinforcement to fall upon us immediately after this with several other reasons induced all the officers to believe firmly that they were sent as spies rather than any thing else and has occasioned my sending them as prisoners tho they expected or at least had some faint hope of being continued as ambassadors they finding where we were encamped instead of coming up in a publick manner sought out one of the most secret retirements fitter for a deserter than an ambassador to encamp in stayed there two or   days sent spies to reconnoitre our camp as we are told tho they deny it their whole body moved    back near   miles sent off two runners to acquaint contrecœur with our strength and where we were encamped c now    men would almost have been a retinue for a princely ambassador instead of a petit why did they if their designs were open stay so long within   miles of us without delivering his ambassy or acquainting me with it his waiting could be with no other design than to get a detachment to enforce the summons as soon as it was given they had no occasion to send out spies for the name of ambassador is sacred among all nations but it was by the track of these spies that they were discovered and we got intelligence of them they would not have retired two miles back without delivering the summons and sought a skulkingplace which to do them justice was done with great judgment but for some special reason besides the summons is so insolent and savors so much of gascoigny that if two men only had come openly to deliver it it was too great indulgence to have sent them back the sense of the halfking on this subject is that they have bad hearts and that this is a mere pretence they never designed to have come to us but in a hostile manner and if we were so foolish as let them go again he never would assist us in taking another of them besides loosing la force i really think would lead more to our disservice than  0 other men as he is a person whose active spirit leads him into all parleys and brought him acquainted with all parts add to this a perfect use of the indian tongue and ye    influence with the indians he ingeniously enough confessed that as soon as he saw the commission and instructions that he believed  and then said he expected some such tendency tho he pretends to say he does not believe the commander had any other but a good design in this engagement we had only one man killed and two or three wounded among which was lieutenant waggener slightly—a most miraculous escape as our right wing was much exposed to their fire and received it all  the halfking received your honours speech very kind but desired me to inform you that he could not leave his people at this time thinking them in great danger he is now gone to the crossing for their families to bring to our camp and desired i would send some men and horses to assist them up which i have accordingly done sent  0 men and upwards of twenty horses he says if your honour has any thing to say you may communicate by me c and that if you have a present for them it may be kept to another occasion after sending up some things for their immediate use he has declared to me he would send these frenchmens scalps with a hatchet to all the nations of indians in union with them and did that very day give a hatchet and a large belt of wampum to a delaware    man to carry to shingiss he promised me to send down the river for all the mingoes and shawanese to our camp where i expect him tomorrow with thirty or forty men with their wives and children to confirm what he has said here he has sent your honor a string of wampum as these runners went off to the fort on sunday last  i shall expect every hour to be attacked and by unequal numbers which i must withstand if there are five to one or else i fear the consequence will be that we shall lose the indians if we suffer ourselves to be drove back i despatched an express immediately to colonel fry with this intelligence desiring him to send reinforcements with all imaginable despatch  your honor may depend i will not be surprised let them come at what hour they will and this is as much as i can promise but my best endeavours shall not be wanting to deserve more i doubt not but if you hear i am beaten but you will at the same time hear that we have done our duty in fighting as long as there was a possibility of hope i have sent lieutenant west accompanied with mr splitdorph and a guard of  0 men to conduct the prisoners in and i believe the officers have acquainted him what answer to return your honour monsieur la force and monsieur drouillon beg to be recommended    to your honours notice and i have promised they will meet with all the favour due to imprisoned officers i have showd all the respect i could to them here and have given some necessary cloathing by which i have disfurnished myself for having brought no more than two or three shirts from wills creek that we might be light i was ill provided to furnish them i am c p s i have neither seen nor heard any particular account of the twigtwees since i came on these waters we have already begun a palisadoed fort and hope to have it up tomorrow i must beg leave to acquaint your honour that captain vanbraam and ensign peyrouny has behaved extremely well since they came out and i hope will meet with your honours favor george washington governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie without date  sir since writing my last i have still stronger presumption indeed almost confirmation that they were sent as spies and were ordered to wait near us till they were truly informed of our intentions situation and strength and were to have acquainted their commander therewith and to have lain lurking here for reinforcements before they served the summons if served at all i doubt not but they will endeavour to amuse you with many smooth stories as they did me but they    were confuted in them all and by circumstances too plain to be denied almost made ashamed of their assertions i dare say you will treat them with respect which is due to all unfortunate persons in their condition but i hope you will give no ear to what they will have an opportunity for displaying to the best advantage having none present to contradict their reports i have heard since they went away that they should say they called to us not to fire but that i know to be false for i was the first man that approached them and the first whom they saw and immediately upon it they ran to their arms and fired briskly till they were defeated  we have heard of another being killed by the indians that made his escape from us so that we are certain of thirtythree killed and taken  i thought it expedient to acquaint your honor with the above as i fancy they will have the assurance of asking the privileges due to an embassy when in strict justice they ought to be hanged as spies of the worst sort    being authorized by their commander at the expense of a character which should be sacred to all nations and never trifled with or used in an equivocal way i am c the   th dispatched ensign latour to the halfking with about twentyfive men and almost as many horses and as i expected some french parties would continually follow that which we had defeated i sent an express to colonel fry for a reinforcement after this the french prisoners desired to speak with me and asked me in what manner i looked upon them whether as the attendants of an embassador or as prisoners of war i answered them that it was in the quality of the latter and gave them my reasons for it as above the  0th detached lieutenant west  and mr splitdorph to take the prisoners to winchester with a guard of twenty men began to raise a fort with small pallisadoes fearing that when the french should hear the news of that defeat we might be attacked by considerable forces george washington    may      great meadow lawrence washington to his brother camp at great meadow    may      since my last we arrived at this place where three days ago we had an engagement with the french that is a party of our men with one of theirs most of our men were out upon other detachments so that i had scarcely  0 men remaining under my command and about  0 or    indians nevertheless we obtained a most signal victory the battle lasted about  0 or    minutes with sharp firing on both sides till the french gave ground and ran but to no great purpose  0 there were    of the french killed among whom was mons de jumonville their commander and    taken prisoners among whom are mess la force and drouillon together with two cadets i have sent them to his honour the governor at winchester under a guard of  0 men conducted by lieutenant west we had but one man killed and two or three wounded among the wounded on our side was lieutenant waggener but no danger it is hoped will ensue we expect every hour to be attacked by superior force but if they forbear one day longer we shall be prepared for them we have already got entrenchments and are about a pallisado which i hope will be finished today the mingoes have struck the french and i hope will give a good blow before they have done i expect  0 odd of them here tonight which with our fort and some reinforcements from col fry will enable us to exert our noble courage with spirit p s i fortunately escaped without any wound for the right wing where i stood was exposed to and received all the enemys fire and it was the part where the man was killed and the rest wounded i heard the bullets whistle and believe me there is something charming in the sound     june the  st arrived here an indian trader with the halfking they said that when mr de jumonville was sent here another party had been detached towards the lower part of the river in order to take and kill all the english they should meet we are finishing our fort towards night arrived ensign towers with the halfking queen aliquippa and about twentyfive or thirty families making in all about eighty or one hundred persons including women and children the old king being invited to come in to our tents told me that he had sent monacatoocha to logstown with wampum and four french scalps which were to be sent to the six nations to the wyandotts c to inform them that they had attacked the french and to demand their assistance to maintain the first advantage he also told me he had something to say at the council but would stay till the arrival of the shawanese whom we expected next morning the  d arrived two or three families of the shawanese and loups we had prayers in the fort the  d the halfking assembled the council and in formed me that he had received a speech from the big kettle grandchaudiere  in answer to the one he had sent him george washington june        governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie from our camp june        honorable sir the halfking with about    familys contg near  0 persons including women and children arrivd here last night he has given me some acct of the twigtwees wyandotts and several other nations of indians which i have transmitted to your honour by an express as you enquird circumstantially    in your last and i was then unable to give any account at all of them the french early in the spring sent a speech to the wyandotts twigtwees and their allies and desired them to take up the hatchet and start to ohio and there cut off the inhabitants with all the english thereon this the big kettle acquainted the halfking with and at the same time assurd him with their good intentions of assisting the   nations and their brothers the english agt the french and that they only waited to see us begin  i have enclosed the speech of the chiefs to which was added another from the warriors informing that they were busy in councilling with the chippeways ottoways c and striving to bring all into the same mind with themselves they desire the   nations virginians and pennsylvanians not to doubt but that they shall accomplish their designs in this and when they do i will send word thereof monacatoocha was sent by the halfking abt   nights ago to the logs town with   french scalps two of which was to be sent to the wyandotts c and the other two to the   nations telling them that the french had tricked them out of their lands for which with their brothers the english who joynd hand in hand they had let them feel the wait of their hatchet which was but trifling yet as it only layd on  0 for that they intd with their brothers to drive the french beyond the lakes monacatoocha has    orders to draw all the indians from ohio and then repair to our camp i proposed to the halfking sending their women and children into the inhabitants for as they must be supported by us it may be done at less expense there than here besides this there may another good attend it their children may imbibe the principles of love and friendship in a stronger degree which if taken when young is generally more firm and lasting he told me he would consider of it and give answer when monacatoocha arrived i hope this will be agreeable to your honour who i wrote to before on this head without receivg an answer we find it very difficult procuring provisions for them as they share equally with our own men which is unavoidable withot turning them adrift entirely montour would be of singular use to me here at this moment in conversing with the indians for i have no persons that i can put any dependence in i make use of all the influence i can to engage them warmly on our side and flatter myself that i am not unsuccessful but for want of a better acquaintance with their customs i am often at a loss how to behave and should be relieved from many anxious fears of offendg them if montour was here to assist me and as he is in the governmnts employt i hope your honr will think with me his services cannot be applyd to so gt advantage as here upon this occasion     there was   french deserters met a few days ago one an englishman at loyal henning  going to virga by one crawford a man of veracity who was assurd by them that there was two major traders confined in irons at the fort when sieur de jumonville was detached and at the same time that he departed for this another party of  0 was sent down ohio to kill or take prisoners of all the english theyd meet with they also assure us that jumonville has all chosen men fixed upon for this enterprise they likewise confirm the report the prisoners gave that   00 men were now in the fort and reinforcets expected if the whole detacht of the french behave with no more resolution than this chosen party did i flatter myself we shall have no gt trouble in driving them to the d— montreal tho i took  0 men under my comd when i marched out yet the darkness of the night was so great that by wandering a little from the main body   were lost and but    ingagd there was also but   indians with arms two of which were boys—one dinwiddie your honors god son who behavd well in action there were   or   other indians who served to knock the poor unhappy wounded in the head and bereivd them of their scalps so that we had but  0 men with which we tried and took    or   men besides others who may have escaped one we have certain acct did    we have just finishd a small pallisadod fort in which with my small numbers i shall not fear the attack of  00 men there is three separate strings of wampum which the halfking has desired me to send one is from the wyandott chiefs to confirm what they said another from the warriors to confirm theirs and the other white is from monacatoocha and since writing the above there has arrived two indians from moskingam who inform me that the wyandotts c are ready to strike so soon as they hear the   nations and english have the  th arrived an indian from the ohio who had lately been at the french fort this indian confirms the news of two traders being taken by the french and sent to canada he said they have set up their pallisadoes and enclosed their fort with exceeding large trees there are eight indian families on this side the river coming to join us he met one of the french who had made his escape from the action of m de jumonvilles he was without either shoes or stockings and scarce able to walk however he let him pass not knowing we had attacked them the  th mr gist is returned and acquaints me of the death of poor colonel fry of the safe arrival of the french prisoners at winchester and which gave the governor great satisfaction i am also informed that mr montour  is coming with a commission to command two hundred indians mr gist had met a french deserter who assured him that there were only five hundred men when they took mr wards fort that they were now less having sent fifteen    men to canada to acquaint the governor of their success that there were yet about two hundred soldiers who only waited for a favourable opportunity to come and join us the  th arrived the last body of the virginia regiment under the command of colonel muse and we learnt that the independent company of carolina was arrived at willscreek the  0th i received the regiment and at night had notice that some french were advancing towards us whereupon i sent a party of indians upon the scout towards gists in order to discover them and to know their number just before night we had an alarm but it proved false george washington  0 june      great meadows governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie  great meadows  0 june      honble sir yours of the  st  nd and  th ulto i received by the post and return your honour my hearty thanks for your kind congratulation on our late success which i hope to improve without risquing the imputation of rashness or hazarding what a prudent conduct would forbid i rejoice that i am likely to be happy under the command of an experienced officer and man of sense  it is what i have ardently wished for  i shall here beg leave to return my grateful    thanks for your favour in promoting me to the command of the regiment believe me honble sir when i assure you my breast is warmed with every generous sentiment that your goodness can inspire i want nothing but opportunity to testifie my sincere regard for your person to whom i stand indebted for so many unmerited favours your honour may depend i shall myself and will endeavour to make my officers shew captain mackay all the respect due to his rank and merit but should have been particularly obliged if your honour had declared whether he was under my command or independent of it  however i shall be studious to avoid all disputes that may tend to publick prejudice but as far as i am able will inculcate harmony and unanimity i hope captain mackay will have more sense than to insist upon any unreasonable distinction tho he and his have commissions from his majesty  let him consider tho we are greatly inferior in respect to profitable advantages yet we    have the same spirit to serve our gracious king as they have and are as ready and willing to sacrifice our lives for our country as they and here once more and for the last time i must say this will be a cancer that will grate some officers of this regiment beyond all measure to serve upon such different terms when their lives their fortunes and their characters are equally and i dare say as effectually exposed as those who are happy enough to have kings commissions i have been solicitous on this head have earnestly endeavoured to reconcile the officers to their appointments and flatter myself i have succeeded having heard no mention thereof latterly i considered the pernicious consequences that would have attended a disunion and therefore was too much attached to my countrys interest to suffer it to ripen after i received your advising letters i am very thankful to you for ordering an assortment of indian goods which we daily find still more necessary i shall take care while they are under my direction that they are judiciously applied and shall be particularly careful in consulting mr croghan and mr montour by whom i shall be advised in all indian affairs agreeably to your directions  i shall with great pleasure wear the medal which you were pleased to compliment me with and shall present the others to indian chiefs as i have already done one to the halfking major muse with captain montour joined us    yesterday and brought the wampum you sent to the halfking which i presented with the medal and speech he is very thankful for the notice you have taken of him major muse brought nine of the swivels with some powder and balls and this day i have engaged fifty or sixty horses to bring up more of the balls and other stores from wills creek if there should be no provisions to load them with the balls are to be brought in leather bags made for the purpose i hear that captain mackay who was to have brought the artillery has marched without it as wagons could not be procured i shall write to mr gist to procure wagons if he is obliged to go to pennsylvania for them to bring out the artillery if not when colonel innes comes up we shall have nothing in readiness and shall let slip this best season for action george washington june         governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie june          we have been extremely ill used by major carlyles deputies which i am heartily sorry for since he is a gentleman so capable of the business himself and has taken so much pains to give satisfaction he i believe has been deceived and we have suffered by those under him and by those who have contracted for provisions we have been six days without flour and there is none upon the road for our relief that we know of though i have by repeated expresses given him timely notice we have not  00 provisions of any sort enough in camp to serve us two days once before we should have been four days without provisions if providence had not sent a trader from the ohio to our relief for whose flour i was obliged to give twentyone shillings and eight pence per hundred in a late letter to major carlyle i have complained of the tardiness of his deputies i likewise desired that suitable stores of ammunition might be sent up speedily for till that is done we have it not in our power to attempt any advantageous enterprise but must wait its arrival at redstone for which i shall set off the moment provisions arrive to sustain us on the march major carlyle mentioned a contract he had made with mr croghan for flour likewise mr croghans offer of furnishing more if required i have therefore desired to have all that mr croghan can furnish the indians are drawing off from the river daily one of whom last night brought news of monacatoocha he went from logstown about five nights ago with the french scalps and four hatchets with which he intended to visit the four tribes of indians between this and lake erie and present to each tribe a scalp and hatchet and at the same time acquaint them that it was expected as the english and six nations had handinhand struck the french they would join our forces this messenger likewise says that monacatoocha was determined not only to counsel with the chiefs of those tribes but with their great warriors also which is customary in these  0  cases and was to return as soon as possible which he imagined would be in fifteen days but in case he should not return in that time he left orders for the indians at logstown to set off for redstone creek so that they would all meet at redstone to join their brothers the english he also desired there might be no attack made against the french fort till he should return by which time he hoped all the forces would be gathered and then they would make a general attack together and gain a complete victory at once the halfking has sent messengers to other places for warriors who are to meet us also at redstone creek besides these he has sent two messengers by the advice of mr croghan mr montour and myself one to invite the shawanese to come and receive one of their men who was imprisoned in carolina and to counsel with us and the other to the delawares for the same purpose as we hear both these nations have accepted the hatchet against us this report was first brought by an indian sent from logstown to the halfking and since confirmed by nine french deserters who arrived at our camp today these men farther say that the fort at the fork is completed and proof against any attempts but with bombs on the land side there were not above five hundred men in it when they left it but they suppose by this time two hundred more are arrived nine hundred were ordered to follow them who might be expected in fourteen or fifteen days i was as much disappointed when i met these persons  0  today as ever i was in my life by misunderstanding the scouts that brought me intelligence that is mistaking ninety for nine i marched out at the head of one hundred and thirty men the major part of the effective men in the regiment full with the hope of procuring another present of french prisoners for your honor judge then my disappointment at meeting nine only and those coming for protection i guarded against all casualties that might happen to the camp and ordered major muse to repair into the fort and erect the small swivels for the defence of the place which he could do in an hours time agreeably to your desire i shall here mention the names of the gentlemen who are to be promoted lieutenant george mercer  will worthily succeed to a captaincy captain vanbraam has acted as captain ever since we left alexandria he is an experienced good officer and very worthy of the command he has enjoyed mr james towers is the oldest ensign  0  for whom you will please to send a lieutenancy to captain stephen i have already given a majors commission finding one blank among colonel frys papers if merit sir will entitle a gentlemen to your notice mr peyrouny may justly claim a share of your favor his conduct has been governed by the most consummate prudence and all his actions have sufficiently testified his readiness to serve his country which i really believe he looks upon virginia to be he was sensibly chagrined when i acquainted him with your pleasure of giving him an ensigncy this he had twelve years ago and long since commanded a company he was prevailed on by colonel fry when he left alexandria to accept the former commission and assist my detachment as i had very few officers till we all met on the ohio which commission he would now have resigned and returned to virginia but for my great dissuasion to the contrary i have promised to solicit your honor to appoint him adjutant and continue him ensign which will induce a very good officer to remain in the regiment the office of adjutant sir is most necessary to a regiment in distributing the daily orders receiving all reports and seeing orders executed in short an adjutant is an indispensable officer should you be pleased to indulge me in this request i shall look upon it in a very particular light as i think the personal merit of the gentleman his knowledge of military duty and his activity will render him highly worthy of the favor an ensign is still wanting whom i hope you will send if you know of any  0  one suitable for the office a young man in the camp who came with captain lewis has solicited but i am yet ignorant of his character and qualities he is a volunteer and recommended by captain lewis in a letter by mr ward you acquainted me that you had given orders to colonel fry to examine into the proceedings of captain trent and his lieutenant frazier by a courtmartial i shall be glad if you will repeat your orders and instructions to me or rather to colonel innes for an officer cannot be tried by those of his own regiment only but has a right to be heard in a general courtmartial captain trents behaviour has been very tardy and has convinced the world of what they before suspected his great timidity lieutenant frazier though not altogether blameless is much more excusable for he would not accept of the commission till he had a promise from his captain that he should not reside at the fort nor visit it above once a week or as he saw necessary  queen aliquippa desired that her son who is really a great warrior might be taken into council as he was declining and unfit for business and that he should have an english name given him i therefore called the indians together by the advice of the halfking presented one of the medals and  0  desired him to wear it in remembrance of his great father the king of england and called him by the name of colonel fairfax which he was told signified the first of the council this gave him great pleasure i was also informed that an english name would please the halfking which made me presume to give him that of your honor and call him dinwiddie interpreted in their language the head of all i am c ps these deserters corroborate what the others said and we suspected la forces party were sent out as spies and were to show that summons if discovered or overpowered by a superior party of ours they say the commander was blamed for sending so small a party since writing the foregoing captain mackay with the independent company has arrived whom i take to be a very good sort of a gentleman for want of proper instructions from your honor i am much at a loss to know how to act or proceed in regard to his company i made it my particular study to receive him as it was your desire with all the respect and politeness that were due to his rank or that i was capable of showing and i do not doubt from his appearance and behaviour that a strict intimacy will ensue when matters shall be put in a clear light but at present i assure you they will rather impede the service than forward it for as they have commissions from the king they look upon themselves as a distinct body and will not incorporate and do duty with our men but keep separate guards and encamp separately i have not offered to control captain mackay in any thing nor showed that i  0  claimed a superior command except in giving the parole and countersign which must be the same in an army consisting of different nations to distinguish friends from foes he knows the necessity of this yet does not think he is to receive it from me then who is to give it am i to issue these orders to a company or is an independent captain to prescribe rules to the virginia regiment this is the question but its absurdity is obvious it now behooves you sir to lay your absolute commands on one or the other to obey this is indispensably necessary for nothing clashes more with reason than to conceive our small bodies can act distinctly without having connexion with one another and yet be serviceable to the public i do not doubt that captain mackay is an officer of sense and i dare say will do the best for the service but sir two commanders are so incompatible that we cannot be as useful to one another or the public as we ought and i am sincerely sorry that he has arrived before your instructions by colonel innes who i doubt not will be fully authorized how to act but as we have no news of colonel innes i have in the mean time desired major carlyle to send this by an immediate express to you who i hope will satisfy these doubts  captain mackay and i have lived in the most perfect harmony since his arrival and have reasoned on this  0  calmly and i believe if we should have occasion to exert our whole force we shall do as well as divided authority can do we have not had the least warmth of dispute he thinks you have not a power to give commissions that will command him if so i can very confidently say that his absence would tend to the public advantage i have been particularly careful of discovering no foolish desire of commanding him neither have i intermeddled with his company in the least or given any directions concerning it except on these general—the word countersign and place to repair to in case of an alarm none of which he thinks he should receive i have testified to him in the most serious manner the pleasure i should take in consulting and advising with him upon all occasions and i am very sensible with him we shall never differ when your honour decides this which i am convinced your own just discernment and consideration will make appear the impossibility of a medium the nature of the thing will not allow of it  it must be known who is to command before orders will be observed and i am very confident your honour will see the absurdity and consider the effects of capt mackays having the direction of the  0  regiment for it would certainly be the hardest thing in life if we are to do double and trible duty and neither be entitled to the pay or rank of soldiers that the first column of the virginia regiment has done more for the interest of the expedition than any other company or corps that will hereafter arrive will be obvious to them all this honble sir capt mackay did not hesitate one moment to allow since he has seen ye work we have done upon the roads c we shall part tomorrow i shall continue my march to red stone while the company remains here but this sir i found absolutely necessary for the publick interest capt mackay says that it is not in his power to oblige his men to work upon the road unless he will engage them a shilling sterling a day which i would not choose to do and to suffer them to march at their ease whilst our faithful soldiers are laboriously employed carrys an air of such distinction that it is not to be wondered at if the poor fellows were to declare the hardship of it he also declares to me that this is not particular to his company only but that no soldiers subject to martial law can be obliged to do it for less i therefore shall continue to endeavour to compleat the work we have begun with my poor fellows we shall have the whole credit as none others have assisted i hope from what has been said your honour will see the necessity of giving your speedy orders on this head and i am sensible you will consider the evil tendency that will accompany captn mackays coming for i am sorry to observe this is what we always  0  hoped to enjoy—the rank of officers which to me sir is much dearer than the pay captn mackay brought none of the cannon very little ammunition about   days allowance of flower and  0 beeves since i have spun a letter to this enormous size i must go a little further and beg your honours patience to peruse it i am much grieved to find our stores so slow advancing god knows when we shall be able to do any thing for to deserve better of our country the contents of this letter is a profound secret the   th two of the men whom we had sent out yesterday upon the scout returned they discovered a small party of french the others went on as far as stuarts upon this advice i thought it necessary to march with the greater part of the regiment to find those ninety men of whom we had intelligence accordingly i gave orders to colonel muse to put away all our baggage and ammunition and to place them in the fort and set a good guard there till my return after which i marched at the head of one hundred and thirty men and about thirty indians but at the distance of half a mile i met the other indians who told me there were only nine deserters whereupon i sent mr montour with some few indians in order to bring them safe to me i caused them to be drest and they confirmed us in our opinion of the intention of m de jumonvilles party that more than one hundred soldiers were only waiting for a favorable opportunity to come and join us that m de contrecœur expected a reinforcement of four hundred men that these reinforcements should have arrived some time before la force had been defeated that the fort was compleated that its front and gates were covered by the artillery that   0 there was a double pallisadoe next to the water that they have only eight small pieces of cannon and know what number of men we are they also informed us that the delaware and shawanese had taken up the hatchet against us whereupon i resolved to invite those two nations to come to a council at mr gists sent for that purpose messengers and wampum the   th i persuaded the deserters to write the following letter to those of their companions who had an inclination to desert  the   th set about clearing the roads the   th set out for redstonecreek and were extremely embarrassed our waggons breaking very often   th dispatched an express to the halfking to perswade him to send a message to the loups which he did as i intended   th eight mingoes arrived from loiston who at their arrival told me of a commission they had and that a council must be held when we assembled they told us in brief that they had often desired to see their brethren out in the field with forces and begged us not to take it amiss that they were amongst the french and that they complied with some of their customs notwithstanding which they were naturally inclined to fall upon them and other words to the same purport after which they said they had brought a speech with them and desired to deliver it with speed these and other discourses to the same purpose made us suspect that their intentions towards us were not good wherefore i delayed giving them audience until the arrival of the halfking and desired the delawares to have patience till then as i only waited their arrival to hold a council which i expected would be that very day after the eight mingoes had conferred a while together they sent me some strings of wampum     desiring me to excuse their insisting on the delivery of their speech so speedily that they now perceived it necessary to wait the arrival of the halfking when the halfking arrived i consented to give them audience a council was held in the camp for that purpose the halfking and several of the six nations loups shawanese to the number of forty were present the speaker of the six nations addressed the following speech to the governor of virginia brethren we your brothers of the sixnations are now come to acquaint you that we have heard you threaten to destroy entirely all your brethren the indians who should not join you on the road wherefore we who keep in our own towns expect every day to be cut in pieces by you we wish to know from your mouth if there be any truth in that report and that you would not look upon it as remarkable that we are come to enquire into it since you very well know that bad news commonly makes a deeper impression upon us than good that we may be fully satisfied by your answers of the truth thereof we give you this belt of wampum we know the french will ask us at our return of what number our brethren are whom we went to see therefore we desire you by this belt to let us know it as also the number of those whom you expect and at what time you expect them and when you reckon to attack the french that we may give notice thereof to our town and know also what we are to tell the french answer brethren we are very glad to see you and sorry that you are disquieted by such reports that the english intend to injure you or any of your allies this report we know must have been forged by the french always treacherous and asserting the greatest falsehoods whenever they think they will turn out to their advantage they speak well promise fine things but all from the     lips only whilst their heart is corrupted and full of venomous poison you have been their children and they would have done every thing for you but they no sooner thought themselves strong enough than they returned to their natural pride and run you off from your lands declaring you had no right on the ohio the english your real friends are too generous to think of ever using the six nations their faithful allies in like manner when you made your address to the governors of virginia and pennsylvania they at your repeated request sent an army to maintain your rights to put you again in the possession of your lands and to protect your wives and children to dispossess the french to maintain your rights and to assure that country to you for those very ends are the english arms actually employed it is for the safety of your wives and your children that we fight and as this is the only motive of our conduct we cannot reasonably doubt of being joined by the remaining part of your forces to oppose the common enemy those who will not join us for this purpose shall be answerable for the consequence we only desire your brethren to chuse that side which seems most acceptable to them the indians of the six nations are those who are most interested in this war for them it is that we fight and i should be in despair were the least hurt to come to them we have engaged in this war to assist and protect you our arms are open to receive you and our hands ready to nourish your families during the war the governor of virgina has often desired they might be sent to him that he might see them in person nourish and cloath them according to their own desire but as you could not determine to send them to him we are ready to share in a friendly manner all our provisions with you and to take such measures and give such orders that enough shall be brought to maintain your wives and children such conduct will evidently prove how much more the english love and esteem their allies the six nations than the french do as we have drawn the sword in your cause and in your defence hesitate no longer delay not one moment but put your wives and children under our protection and they shall find plenty of provisions in the meanwhile set your young men and your warriors to     sharpen their hatchets to join and unite with us vigorously in our battles the present my brethren which i offer you is not so considerable as i could wish but i expect in a short time a quantity of goods which are to be at my disposal to reward those who shall have shewn themselves brave and active on this occasion in short i shall recompense them most generously be of good courage my brethren deliver your country and assure it to your children let me know the thoughts of your hearts on this affair that i may give an account of your sentiments to your great friend and brother the governor of virginia to assure you of my sincerity and esteem i present you this belt the  0th the council still continued when the delawares knew that they were suspected of being in the french interest they demanded the reason why they had been sent for and what they should tell the french at their return i answered them it was to let them understand that we were to come at their reiterated requests to assist them with sword in hand that we intended to put them in the possession of those lands which the french had taken from them and as they had often demanded our assistance as our ancient and faithful allies i invited them to come and place themselves under our protection together with their women and children whereupon the indian speaker stretched out his blanket on the floor and laid several belts and strings of wampum thereon in the same order he had received them from the french this done he repeated the speeches of m de contrecœur after which the delaware speaker directed to me the following speech brethren the governor of virginia and pennsylvania we your brethren the delawares remember perfectly well the treaty of loiston  where you and your uncles the six nations considering     the bad situation we were in for want of a man to be our leader you then gave us a king and told us he should transact all our public affairs between you and us you gave us a charge not to listen to every vain report that might be spread but to consult ourselves and to do what would seem to us to be right we assure you that we have given no credit to any of those reports nor ever shall but will be guided by you our brethren and by our uncles the six nations and will do on all occasions what is just and right taking advice from you alone to assure you of the desire we have to fulfil our engagements with you we present you this belt after which they made the following discourse to the six nations uncles thirteen days are now past since we have received this belt from the onondago council i do not doubt your knowledge of it they exhorted us to remember old times when they cloathed us with a robe reaching down to our heels afterwards told us to raise it up to our knees and there to make it very fast and come to them at the head of susquehannah where they had provided a place for us to live that they had also sent a speech to those of our nation who live near the minnesinks inviting them to go to the place by them appointed that they might live with us they also sent us a speech to give us notice that the english and french were upon the point of coming to an engagement on the river ohio and exhorted us to do nothing in that juncture but what was reasonable and what they would tell us themselves lastly they recommended to us to keep fast hold of the chain of friendship which has so long subsisted between us and them and our brethren the english a belt then the delawares spoke to the shawanese as follows— grandsons by this belt we take you between our arms and fetch you away from the ohio where you now are to carry you amongst us that you may live where we live and there live in peace and quiet the council after this was adjourned to the next morning     the   st we assembled very early and i spoke first to the delawares in the following manner brethren by your open and generous conduct on this occasion you have made yourselves dearer to us than ever we return you our thanks that you did not go to venango when the french first invited you there their treating you in such a childish manner as we perceive they do raises in us a just and strong resentment they call you their children and speak to you as if you in reality were children and had no more understanding than such weigh well my brethren and compare all their discourse and you will find that all it tends to is to tell you i am going to open your eyes to unstop your ears and such words to no purpose and only proper to amuse children you also observe brethren that if they deliver a speech or make a promise and confirm it by a belt they imagine it binds them no longer than they think it consistent with their interest to stand to it they have given one example of it and i will make you observe it in the jump which they say they have made over the boundaries which you had set them which ought to stir you up my brethren to just anger and lead you to embrace the favourable opportunity that we offer you as we are come at your request to assist you and by means of which you may make them jump back again with more speed than they advanced a string of wampum the french are continually telling you not to give heed to the ill reports that are told you concerning them who are your fathers if they did not know in their very souls how richly they deserve it on your account why should they suspect of being accused why should they forewarn you of it to hinder you from believing what is told you concerning them as to what they say of us our conduct alone will answer in our behalf examine the truth yourselves you know the roads leading to our habitations you have lived amongst us you can speak our language but in order to justify ourselves from whatever might be said against us and assure you of our brotherly love we once more invite your old men your wives and your children to take sanctuary under our protection and between our arms     to be plentifully fed whilst your warriors and young men join with ours and espouse together the common cause a string of wampum brethren we thank you with all our hearts for having declared unto us your resolution of accomplishing the engagements which you had entered into at the treaty of loiston and we can do no otherwise than praise your generous conduct with regard to your grand sons the shawanese it gives us infinite pleasure we are greatly obliged to the council given you by onondago charging you to hold fast the chain of friendship by which we are bound i dare say that had he known how nearly you are interested in this war or that it is for the love of you and at your request we have taken up arms he would have ordered you to declare and to act immediately against the common enemy of the six nations in order to assure you of my affection and to confirm the truth of what i have said i present you these two great strings after this the council broke up and those treacherous devils who had been sent by the french as spies returned though not without some tale ready prepared to amuse the french which may be of service to make our own designs succeed as they had told me there were sixteen hundred french and seven hundred indians on their march to reinforce those at the garrison i persuaded the halfking to send three of his men to inquire into the truth of it though i imagined this news to be only soldiers discourse these indians were accordingly sent in a secret manner before the council broke up and had orders to go to the fort and inform themselves carefully from all the indians they should meet and if there was any news worthy of the trouble one of them should return and the other two continue their rout as far as venango and about the lake in order to obtain a perfect knowledge of every thing i also perswaded king shingiss to send out rangers     towards the river to bring us news in case any french should come i gave him also a letter which he was to send me back again by an express to prevent my being imposed upon by a false alarm though king shingiss and others of the delawares could not be persuaded to retire to our camp with their families through the fear they were in of onondagos council they nevertheless gave us strong assurances of their assistance and directed us in what manner to act in order to obtain our desire the method was this we were to prepare a great warbelt to invite all those warriors who would receive it to act independently of their king and council and king shingiss promised to take privately the most subtile methods to make the affair success though he did not dare to do it openly the very day the council broke up i perswaded kaquehuston a trusty delaware to carry that letter to the fort which the french deserters had written to their comrades and gave him instructions how he should behave in his observations upon several articles of which i had spoken to him for i am certain the fort may be surprized as the french are encamped outside and cannot keep a strict guard by reason of the works they are about i also perswaded george another trusty delaware to go and take a view of the fort a little after kaquehuston and gave him proper instructions recommending him particularly to return with speed that we might have fresh news immediately after the council was over nothwithstanding all that mr montour could do to disswade them the delawares as also the halfking and all the other indians returned to the great meadows but though we had lost them i still had spies of our own people to prevent being surprised as i was told that a belt of wampum and a speech might bring us back both the halfking and his young men i sent the following speech by mr croghan—     tis but lately since we were assembled together we were sent here by your brother the governor of virginia at your own request in order to succour you and fight for your cause wherefore my brethren i must require that you and your young men come to join and encamp with us that we may be ready to receive our brother monacatoocha whom i daily expect that this request may have its desired effect and make a suitable impression upon your minds i present you with this string of wampum as those indians who were spies sent by the french were very inquisitive and asked us many questions to know by what way we proposed to go to the fort and what time we expected to arrive there i left off working any further at the road and told them as we intended to keep on across the woods as far as the fort falling the trees c that we were waiting here for the reinforcement which was coming to us our artillery and our waggons to accompany us there but as soon as they were gone i set about marking out and clearing a road towards red stone the   th towards night came three men from the great meadows amongst whom was the son of queen aliquippa he brought me a letter from mr croghan informing me what pains he was at to perswade any indians to come to us that in truth the halfking was inclined and was preparing to join us but had received a blow which was a hindrance to it i thought it proper to send captain montour to fort necessity in order to try if he could possibly gain the indians to come to us the   th arrived an indian bringing news that monacatoocha had burnt his village loiston and was gone by water with his people to redstone and might be expected there in two days this indian passed close by the fort and assures us that the french had received no reinforcement except a small number of indians who had killed as he said two or three of the delawares i did not fail to     relate that piece of news to the indians in its proper colours and particularly to two of the delawares who are here the   th detached captain lewis lieutenant waggener and ensign mercer two serjeants two corporals one drummer and sixty men to endeavour to clear a road to the mouth of redstonecreek on monaungahela the journal as printed in the précis des faits ends abruptly with the entry made on the   th on the   th mackay with the company from south carolina joined washington but hearing that the garrison at duquesne had been reinforced a council of war determined upon a retreat—a measure of no little difficulty through the want of horses to carry the guns provisions and camp stores the entire labor involved fell upon the virginia troops those of south carolina holding aloof and refusing to assist on july  st the great meadows were reached and here a halt was called to allow the weary troops to rest and to allow reinforcements to come up for the new york companies after unaccountable delay were reported to be at alexandria and about to march for the ohio meantime the garrison at duquesne had received additions and coulon de villiers a brother of jumonville had arrived from montreal with a large force of indians it was at once determined to avenge the murder of jumonville and attack the english whether found on soil claimed by the french or on territory that was english beyond any doubt the party under the command of villiers reached red stone creek on june  0th and on july  d the camp at gists so recently abandoned by washington from the indian scouts the position of the english was soon determined and on the next day the two forces met washington had made a small trench for protection but it proved of little service as his men were exposed to a crossfire from the french and indians what followed is best told in the language of govr dinwiddie immediately they the french appeared in sight of our camp and fired at our people at a great distance which did no harm our small forces were drawn up in good order to receive them before their entrenchments but did not return their first fire reserving it till they came nigher the enemy advanced irregularly within  0 yards of our forces and then made a second discharge and observing they did not intend to attack them in open field they retired within their trenches and reserved their fire thinking from their numbers they would force their trenches but finding they made no attempt of this kind the colonel gave orders to our people to fire on the enemy which they did with great briskness and the officers declare this engagement continued from    oclock till   oclock at night they being without shelter rainy weather and their trenches to the knee in water whereas the french were sheltered all round our camp by trees from thence they galled our people all the time as above about   oclock at night the french called out to parley our people mistrusting   0 their sincerity from their numbers and other advantages refused it at last they desired us to send an officer that could speak french and they gave their parole for his safe return to them on which the commander sent two officers to whom they gave their proposals    from our few numbers and our bad situation they were glad to accept of them otherways were determined to lose their lives rather than be taken prisoners the next morning a party from the french came and took possession of our encampment and our people marched off with colors flying and beat of drum but there appeared a fresh party of  00 indians to join the french who galled our people much and with difficulty were restrained from attacking them however they pilfered our peoples baggage and at the beginning of the engagement the french killed all the horses cattle and live creatures they saw so that our forces were obliged to carry off the wounded men on their backs to some distance from the place of the engagement where they left them with a guard the scarcity of provisions made them make quick marches to get among the inhabitants which was about  0 miles of bad road—to the lords of trade july         when the french proposed the parley there were but two men in the english camp acquainted with the language—peyroney who was badly wounded and vanbraam who was sent to complete the capitulation it is certain that vanbraam blundered seriously in his interpretation of the articles and probably through ignorance the following are the articles as signed comme notre intention na jamais été de troubler la paix et la bonne harmonie qui régnoit entre les deux princes amis mais seulement de venger lassassin qui a été fait sur un de nos officiers porteur dune sommation et sur son escorte comme aussi dempêcher aucun établissement sur les terres du roi mon maître a ces considérations nous voulons bien accorder grace à tous les anglois qui sont dans ledit fort aux conditions ceaprés article i nous accordons au commandant anglois de se retirer avec toute sa garnison pour sen retourner paisiblement dans son pays et lui promettons dempêcher quil lui soit fait aucune insulte par nos françois et de maintenir autant quil sera en notre pouvoir tous les sauvages qui sont avec nous art ii il lui sera permis de sortir et demporter tout ce qui leur appartiendra à lexception de lartillerie que nous nous réservons art iii que nous leur accordons les honneurs de la guerre quils sortiront tambour battant avec une petite pièce de canon voulant bien parlà leur prouver que nous les traitons en amis art iv que sitôt les articles signés de part et dautre ils amèneront le pavillon anglais art v que demain à la pointe du jour un détachment françois ira faire défiler la garnison et prendre possession dudit fort art vi que comme les anglois nont presque plus de chevaux ni bœufs ils seront libres de mettre leurs effets en cache pour venir chercher lorsquils auront rejoint des chevaux ils pourront à cette fin laisser des gardiens en tel     nombre quils voudront aux conditions quils donneront parole dhonneur de ne plus travailler à aucun établissement dans ce lieuci ni en deça de la hauteur des terres  art vii que comme les anglois ont en leur pouvoir un officier deux cadets et généralement les prisonniers quils nous ont faits dans lassassinat du sieur de jumonville et quils promettent de les envoyer avec sauvegarde jusquau fort duquesne situé sur la bellerivière et que pour sûreté de cet article ainsi que de ce traité messrs jacob vanbraam et robert stobo tous deux capitaines nous seront remis en otage jusquà larrivée de nos françois et canadiens cidessus mentionnés nous nous obligeons de votre côté à donner escorte pour ramener en sûreté les deux officiers qui nous promettent nos françois dans deux mois et demi pour le plus tard the admissions and contract contained in certain of these articles could hardly fail to displease the english when they were published and the entire blame was laid upon vanbraam dinwiddie went so far as to denounce him as a poltroon and though an officer with us they say he has joined the french one of his fellow officers adam stephen also intimates evil intentions on the part of the dutch interpreter but his description of the conditions under which the articles were read—it rained so hard that he could not give us a written translation of them we could scarcely keep the candle lighted to read them by—certainly affords some excuse for a misapprehension on the part of the hearers villiers boasted that he had made the english admit quils nous avoient fait un assassin dans le camp de mon frère but both mackay and stephen insisted that the word assassination had not been read to them by vanbraam after the french government had published the précis des faits the attention of washington was called to the articles of capitulation and his journal as printed in that volume he then wrote as follows i am really sorry that i have it not in my power to answer your request in a more satisfactory manner if you had favored me with the journal a few days sooner i would have examined it carefully and endeavoured to point out such errors as might conduce to your use my advantage and the public satisfaction but now it is out of my power i had no time to make any remarks upon that piece which is called my journal the enclosed are observations on the french notes they are of no use to me separated nor will they i believe be of any to you yet i send them unconnected and incoherent as they were taken for i have no opportunity to correct them     in regard to the journal i can only observe in general that i kept no regular one during that expedition rough minutes of occurrences i certainly took and find them as certainly and strangely metamorphosed some parts left out which i remember were entered and many things added that never were thought of the names of men and things egregiously miscalled and the whole of what i saw englished is very incorrect and nonsensical yet i will not pretend to say that the little body who brought it to me has not made a literal translation and a good one short as my time is i cannot help remarking on villiers account of the battle of and transactions at the meadows as it is very extraordinary and not less erroneous than inconsistent he says the french received the first fire it is well known that we received it at six hundred paces distance he also says our fears obliged us to retreat in a most disorderly manner after the capitulation how is this consistent with his other account he acknowledges that we sustained the attack warmly from ten in the morning until dark and that he called first to parley which strongly indicates that we were not totally absorbed in fear if the gentleman in his account had adhered to the truth he must have confessed that we looked upon his offer to parley as an artifice to get into and examine our trenches and refused on this account until they desired an officer might be sent to them and gave their parole for his safe return he might also if he had been as great a lover of the truth as he was of vainglory have said that we absolutely refused their first and second proposals and would consent to capitulate on no other terms than such as we obtained that we were wilfully or ignorantly deceived by our interpreter in regard to the word assassination i do aver and will to my dying moment so will every officer that was present the interpreter was a dutchman little acquainted with the english tongue therefore might not advert to the tone and meaning of the word in english but whatever his motives were for so doing certain it is he called it the death or the loss of sieur jumonville so we received and so we understood it until to our great surprise and mortification we found it otherwise in a literal translation that we left our baggage and horses at the meadows is certain that there was not even a possibility to bring them away is equally certain as we had every horse belonging to the camp killed or taken away during the action so that it was impracticable to bring any thing off that our shoulders were not able to bear and to wait there was impossible for we had scarce three days provisions and were seventy miles from a supply yet to say we came off precipitately is absolutely false notwithstanding they did contrary to articles suffer their indians to pillage our baggage and commit all kinds of irregularity we were with them until ten oclock the next day we destroyed our powder and other stores nay even our private baggage to prevent its falling into their hands as we could not bring it off when we had got about a mile from the place of action we missed two or three of the wounded and sent a party back to bring them up this is the party he speaks of we brought them all safe off and encamped within three miles of the meadows these are circumstances     i think that make it evidently clear that we were not very apprehensive of danger the colors he speaks of as left were a large flag of immense size and weight our regimental colors were brought off and are now in my possession their gasconades and boasted clemency must appear in the most ludicrous light to every considerate person who reads villiers journal such preparations for an attack such vigor and intrepidity as he pretends to have conducted his march with such revenge as by his own account appeared in his attack considered it will hardly be thought that compassion was his motive for calling a parley but to sum up the whole mr villiers pays himself no great compliment in saying we were struck with a panic when matters were adjusted we surely could not be afraid without cause and if we had cause after capitulation it was a reflection upon himself in august a full account of this engagement was laid before the house of burgesses and a vote of thanks was given to washington and his officers—the major of the regiment and captain vanbraam excepted the former for cowardice the latter for his blunder in leading washington to sign the capitulation containing such awkward admissions further a pistole was granted to every private in the engagement the thanks of the officers were conveyed by washington but it was a subject of mortification to them that the governor declined to carry out the stipulations of the article entered into with the french dinwiddie gave the following reason for his action in a letter to the board of trade the french after the capitulation entered into with colonel washington took eight of our people and exposed them to sale and missing thereof sent them prisoners to canada on hearing of this i detained the seventeen prisoners the officers and two cadets as i am of opinion after they were in my custody washington could not engage for their being returned i have ordered a flag of truce to be sent to the french offering the return of their officer and the two cadets for the two hostages they have of ours this course of proceeding was not suitable to the principles of honor and sense of equity entertained by colonel washington but he had no further control of the affair mr sparks says vanbraam never returned to virginia but the editor of the dinwiddie papers writes that he was retained in captivity until the surrender of montreal in sept    0 when he returned to virginia his services were recognized in the allotment by george washington as commissioner of virginia of  000 acres of land in      and in july         he was made major of the  0th battalion of the  0th foot or royal americans then stationed in the west indies—dinwiddie papers i p    note the virginia gazette on november  th    0 announced the arrival in town of capt vanbraam the indian account of these engagements differs somewhat from that first given but was told by scarroyada in december      in brief it was as follows that the governor of virginia sent to the halfking by capt trent a belt of wampum with a hatchet in it thus inviting the indians to join in the war against the french when we got it we put it into a private pocket on the inside of our garment it lay next to our breasts as we were on the road going to council with our brethren a company of french in number thirtyone overtook us and desired us to go and     council with them and when we refused they pulled us by the arm and almost stripped the chain of covenant from off it but still i would suffer none to go with them we thought to have got before them but they passed us and when we saw they endeavored to break the chain of friendship i pulled this belt out of my pocket and looked at it and saw there this hatchet and then went and told col washington of these thirtyone frenchmen and we and a few of our brothers fought with them ten were killed and twentyone were taken alive whom we delivered to col washington telling him that we had blooded the edge of his hatchet a little davison  said he was in the action and that there were but eight indians who did most of the execution that was done col washington and the halfking differed much in judgment and on the colonels refusing to take his advice the english and indians separated after which the indians discovered the french in an hollow and hid themselves lying on their bellies behind a hill afterwards they discovered col washington on the opposite side of the hollow in the gray of the morning and when the english fired which they did in great confusion the indians came out of their cover and closed with the french and killed them with their tomahawks on which the french surrendered the halfking complained very much of the behaviour of col washington to him tho in a very moderate way saying the col was a goodnatured man but had no experience saying that he took upon him to command the indians as his slaves and would have them every day upon the out scout and attack the enemy by themselves and that he would by no means take advice from the indians that he lay at one place from one full moon to the other and made no fortifications at all but that little thing upon the meadow where he thought the french would come up to him in open field that had he taken the halfkings advice and made such fortifications as the halfking advised him to make he would certainly have beat the french off that the french had acted as great cowards and the english as fools in that engagement that he the halfking had carried off his wife and children so did other indians before the battle begun because col washington would never listen to them but was always driving them on to fight by his directions—weisers journal      george washington    august      alexandria william fairfax to william fairfax  alexandria    august      honble sir since my last to you i have received by mr splitdorph the letter therein alluded to of the  st inst     the contents of which are nearly the same with the other received from the governour four days before dated the  d inst the following is an exact copy of it     the council met yesterday and considering the present state of our forces and having reason to think that the french will be reinforced next spring it was resolved that the forces should immediately march over the allegany mountains either to dispossess the french of their fort or build one in a proper place that may be fixed upon by a council of war colonel innes has my orders for executing the above affair i am therefore now to order you to get your regiment completed to three hundred men and i have no doubt that you will be able to enlist what you are deficient of your number very soon and march directly to wills creek to join the other forces and that there may be no delay i order you to march what companies you have complete and leave orders with the officers remaining to follow you as soon as they shall have enlisted men sufficient to make up their companies you know the season of the year calls for despatch i depend upon your former usual diligence and spirit to encourage your people to be active on this occasion consult with major carlyle what ammunition which may be wanted that i may send it up immediately i trust much to your diligence and despatch in getting your regiment to wills creek as soon as possible colonel innes will consult you in the appointment of officers for your regiment pray consider if practicable that to send a party of indians c to destroy the corn at the fort and logstown would be of great service to us and a considerable disappointment to the enemy i can say no more but to press the despatch of your regiment to wills creek and that success may attend our arms and just expedition is the sincere desire of sir yours c  thus sir you will see i am ordered with the utmost despatch to repair to wills creek with the     regiment to do which under the present circumstances is as impracticable as it is as far as i can see into the thing to dispossess the french of their fort both of which with our means are morally impossible the governor observes that considering the state of our forces at present it is thought advisable to move out immediately to dispossess the french now that very reason the state of our forces is alone sufficiently opposed to the measure without a large addition to them consider i pray you sir under what unhappy circumstances the men at present are and their numbers compared with those of the enemy are so inconsiderable that we should be harassed and drove from place to place at their pleasure and to what end would the building of a fort be unless we could proceed as far as redstone where we should have to take water and where the enemy can come with their artillery c i cannot see unless it be to secure a retreat which we should have no occasion for were we to go out in proper force and properly provided which i aver cannot be done this fall for before our force can be collected with proper stores of provisions ammunition workingtools c it would bring on a season in which horses cannot travel over the mountains on account of snows want of forage slipperiness of the roads high waters c neither can men unused to that life live there without some other defence from the weather than tents this i know of my own knowledge as i was out last winter from the  st of november till some time in january     and notwithstanding i had a good tent was as properly prepared and as well guarded in every respect as i could be against the weather yet the cold was so intense that it was scarcely supportable i believe out of the five or six men that went with me three of them though they were as well clad as they could be were rendered useless by the frost and were obliged to be left upon the road but the impossibility of supporting us with provisions is alone sufficient to discourage the attempt for were commissaries with sufficient funds to set about procuring provisions and getting them out it is not probable that enough can be conveyed out this fall to support us through the winter for you are to consider sir as i before observed that the snows and hard frosts set in very early upon those mountains and as they are in many places almost inaccessible at all times it is then more than horses can do to clamber up them but allow that they could for want of provender they will become weak and die upon the road as ours did though we carried corn with us for that purpose and purchased from place to place this reason holds good also against driving out live stock which if it could be done would save some thousands of horse loads that might be employed in carrying flour which alone not to mention ammunition tools c we shall find will require more horses than at this present moment can be procured with our means his honor also asks whether it is practicable to destroy the corn at the fort and at logstown at     this question i am a little surprised when it is known we must pass the french fort and the ohio to get to logstown and how this can be done with inferior numbers under the disadvantages we labor i see not and of the ground to hope we may engage a sufficient party of indians for this undertaking i have no information nor have i any conception for it is well known that notwithstanding the expresses that the indians sent to one another and all the pains that montour and croghan who by vainly boasting of their interest with the indians involved the country in great calamity by causing dependence to be placed where there was none could take never could induce above thirty fighting men to join us and not more than one half of those serviceable upon any occasion  i could make many other remarks equally true and pertinent but to you sir who i am sensible have acquired a pretty good knowledge of the country and who see the difficulties that we labor under in getting proper necessaries even at winchester it is needless therefore i shall only add some of the difficulties which we are particularly subjected to in the virginia regiment and to begin sir you are sensible of the sufferings our soldiers underwent in the last attempt in a good season to take possession of the fork of the allegany and monongahela you also saw the disorders those sufferings produced among   0 them at winchester after they returned they are yet fresh in their memories and have an irritable effect through the indiscretion of mr splitdorph they got some intimation that they were again ordered out and it immediately occasioned a general clamour and caused six men to desert last night this we expect will be the consequence every night except prevented by close confinement in the next place i have orders to complete my regiment and not a  d is sent for that purpose can it be imagined that subjects fit for this purpose who have been so much impressed with and alarmed at our want of provisions which was a main objection to enlisting before will more readily engage now without money than they did before with it we were then from the  st of february till the  st of may and could not complete our three hundred men by forty and the officers suffered so much by having their recruiting expenses withheld that they unanimously refuse to engage in that duty again without they are refunded for the past and a sufficient allowance made them in future i have in the next place to show the state of the regiment sent you a report by which you will perceive what great deficiencies there are of men arms tents kettles screws which was a fatal want before bayonets cartouchboxes c c again were our men ever so willing to go for want of the proper necessaries of life they are unable to do it the chief part are almost naked and scarcely a man has either shoes stockings or hat these things the merchants will not credit them for     the country has made no provision they have not money themselves and it cannot be expected that the officers will engage for them again personally having suffered greatly already on this head especially now when we have all the reason in the world to believe they will desert whenever they have an opportunity there is not a man that has a blanket to secure him from cold or wet ammunition is a material article and that is to come from williamsburg or wherever the governor can procure it an account must be first sent of the quantity which is wanted this added to the carriage up with the necessary tools c that must be had as well as the time of bringing them round will i believe advance us into that season when it is usual in more moderate climates to retreat into winterquarters but here with us to begin a campaign  the promises of those traders who offer to contract     for large quantities of flour are not to be depended upon a most flagrant instance of which we experienced in croghan who was under obligation to major carlyle for the delivery of this article in a certain time and who was an eyewitness to our wants yet had the assurance during our sufferings to tantalize us and boast of the quantity he could furnish as he did of the number of horses he could command notwithstanding we were equally disappointed of these also for out of two hundred head he had contracted for we never had above twentyfive employed in bringing the flour that was engaged for the camp and even this small as the quantity was did not arrive within a month of the time it was to have been delivered another thing worthy of consideration is that if we depend on indian assistance we must have a large quantity of proper indian goods to reward their services and make them presents it is by this means     alone that the french command such an interest among them and that we had so few this with the scarcity of provisions was proverbial would induce them to ask when they were to join us if we meant to starve them as well as ourselves but i will have done and only add assurances of the regard and affection with which i am c george washington  0 august      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria  0 august      honble sir mr peyroney soliciting for leave to attend the assembly hoping to have some allowance made for his loss of cloathes c which he sustained in common with us all and being not thoroughly cured of his wounds  which has hitherto rendered him unfit for duty i thought it proper to indulge him in this request and he now comes for these purposes aforesaid by him i again take the liberty of recommending to your honor the great necessity there is of a regulation in the soldiers pay and that a deduction be made for the country to furnish them with cloathes otherwise they never will be fit for service they are now naked and cant get credit even for a hat and are teazing the officers every day to furnish them with these and other necessaries another thing which should be fixed indisputably is the law we are to be guided by whether martial or military if the former i must beg the favour of your honour to give me some written orders and indemnification     otherwise i cannot give my assent as i am liable for all the proceedings to any judgment of the martial court that touches the life of a soldier tho at this time there is absolute necessity for it as the soldiers are deserting constantly and yesterday while we were at church    of them collected and were going off in the face of their officers but were stopped and imprisoned before the plot came to its full height colonel innes did not fill up any commissions for the virginia regiment which has given those that were entitled to promotion some uneasiness his reasons were it would be unnecessary expense to the country till there were orders to recruit but this i think should not have been considered whilst it is remembered how small encouragement is shown them upon every occasion another motive which i believe served to prevent it was his dislike to the tenour of the commission which savoured so much of the militia he told me he would send down another for your approbation and colonel fairfax has also taken another both of which is greatly preferable to those by which we act and here i must beg leave to acquaint your honour that the one you sent me is not signed the officers are uneasy about their pay and think it hard to be kept out of it so long they hope your honour will order that the dates of their commissions be from the vacancys that happened of which i have enclosed a list for your information hoping with them your honour will be kind enough to fill them up yourself and send such commissions as were sent for precedents mr west lieutenant of vanbraams company has resigned his commission     which i herewith send i also enclose a list of medicines which the doctor desires may be procured for the use of the regiment he solicits much for a mate and i believe it necessary as he often has more business than he can well manage if there were a large detachment sent upon duty it would be imprudent to go without the surgeon if your honour should think proper to promote mr peyroney we shall be at a loss for a good disciplinarian to do adjutants duty which requires a perfect knowledge of all the kinds of duty i should therefore take it extremely kind if you would be pleased to confer the office upon mr frazier whom i think i can fully answer for let his former conduct have been what it will we have catchd two deserters which i keep imprisoned till i receive your honors answer how far the martial law may be extended and it is necessary that an example be made of some for warning to others for there is scarce a night or an opportunity but what some or other are deserting often two or three or four at a time we always advertise and pursue them as quickly as possible but seldom to any purpose the expenses attending this will fall heavy upon the country while this spirit prevails i am c george washington   st augt      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria   st augt      honble sir the bearer hereof mr wright  discovering an inclination to the art military and having in some measure made it his study i have taken the liberty     to recommend him to your honour for one of the vacancys in the virginia regiment this i do with more assurance of succeeding as mr wrights character for good sense and sobriety will render him worthy the favor you may please to confer and i dare venture to say he will endeavor to deserve yesterday mr peyroney set off from this who i hope will also meet with your honours approbation and indulgence as his behaviour has merited a reward from his country such he looks upon this to be mr campbell arrivd yesterday after appointing the musters for the northern neck i was not a little surprised to hear him say he was to have the half of my salary especially when he at the same time gave me to understand he expected it was the half of the £ 0 exclusive of the £ 0 which he has for his two countys which is near a third of what i get for the whole    countys—a great disproportion this i hope your honour gave mr campbell no room to expect this for i think it exceeding hard that i shoud give so much more for a deputy than others especially when the duty is much easier for the middle district which has  0 countys muse gives but £ 0 colo thornton gives yet less for his while i by mr campbells account is to give £   or at any rate £ 0 i hope if your honour is kind enough to continue me in that office you will not oblige me to give such an exorbitant allowance to a person who by all acct knows nothing of the duty he has undertaken i can get a person whom i have taken great pains myself to teach and who is     perfectly acquainted with every part of the service to do the duty of the whole for the same that others give and i shoud be very glad for the sake of having the countys kept in tolerable discipline and for the favour of obliging me your honour woud indulge me in this as i will engage it shall turn more to the public advantage whose interest i am certain from well founded reasons you espouse preferable to that of private i must again mention mr frazier as a person we shall much need if mr peyroney is promoted as i hope he will be george washington    november      colonel william fitzhugh to colonel william fitzhugh    november       dear sir i was favored with your letter from rousley hall of the  th instant it demands my best acknowledgments     for the particular marks of esteem you have expressed therein and for the kind assurances of his excellency governor sharpes good wishes towards me i also thank you and sincerely sir for your friendly intention of making my situation easy if i return to the service and do not doubt could i submit to the terms that i should be as happy under your command in the absence of the general as under any gentlemans whatever but i think the disparity between the present offer of a company and my former rank too great to expect any real satisfaction or enjoyment in a corps where i once did or thought i had a right to command even if his excellency had power to suspend the orders received in the secretary of wars letter which by the by i am very far from thinking he either has or will attempt to do without fuller instructions than i believe he has especially too as there has been a representation of this matter by governour dinwiddie and i believe the assembly of this state we have advices that it was received before demmarree obtained his letter all that i presume the general can do is to prevent the different corps from interfering which will occasion the duty to be done by corps instead     of detachments a very inconvenient way as is found by experience  you make mention in your letter of my continuing in the service and retaining my colonels commission this idea has filled me with surprise for if you think me capable of holding a commission that has neither rank or emolument annexed to it you must entertain a very contemptible opinion of my weakness and believe me to be more empty than the commission itself besides sir if i had time i could enumerate many good reasons that forbid all thoughts of my returning and which to you or any other would upon the strictest scrutiny appear to be well founded i must be reduced to a very low command and subjected to that of many who have acted as my inferior officers in short every captain bearing the kings commission every halfpay officer or others appearing with such commission would rank before me for these reasons i choose to submit to the loss of health which i have however already sustained not to mention the effects and the fatigue i have undergone in our first efforts than subject myself to the same inconveniences and run the risk of a second disappointment   0 i shall have the consolation of knowing that i have opened the way when the smallness of our numbers exposed us to the attacks of a superior enemy that i have hitherto stood the heat and brunt of the day and escaped untouched in time of extreme danger and that i have the thanks of my country for the services i have rendered it it shall not sleep in silence my having received information that those peremptory orders from home which you say could not be dispensed with for reducing the regiments into independent companies were generated hatched and brought from wills creek ingenuous treatment and plain dealing i at least expected  it is to be hoped the project will answer it shall meet with my acquiescence in every thing except personal services i herewith enclose governour sharpes letter which i beg you will return to him with my acknowledgments for the favour he intended me assure him sir as you truly may of my reluctance to quit the service and of the pleasure i should have received in attending his fortunes also inform him that it was to obey the call of honour and the advice of my friends i declined it and not to gratify any desire i had to     leave the military line my inclinations are strongly bent to arms the length of this and the small room i have left tell me how necessary it is to conclude which i will do as you always shall find truly and sincerely your most humble servant      george washington    march      mount vernon robert orme to robert orme mount vernon    march      sir i was not favored with your polite letter of the  d inst until yesterday acquainting me with the notice his excellency general braddock  is pleased to honor me with by kindly inviting me to become     one of his family the ensuing campaign it is true sir that i have ever since i declined my late command expressed an inclination to serve the ensuing campaign as a volunteer and this inclination is not a little increased since it is likely to be conducted by a gentleman of the generals experience but besides this and the laudable desire i may have to serve with my best abilities my king and country i must be ingenuous enough to confess that i am not a little biassed by selfish considerations to explain sir i wish earnestly to attain some knowledge in the military profession and believing a more favorable opportunity cannot offer than to serve under a gentleman of general braddocks abilities and experience it does as you may reasonably suppose not a little contribute to influence my choice but sir as i have taken the liberty to express my sentiments so freely i shall beg your indulgence while i add that the only bar which can check me in the pursuit of this object is the inconveniences     that must necessarily result from some proceedings which happened a little before the generals arrival and which in some measure had abated the ardor of my desires and determined me to lead a life of retirement into which i was just entering at no small expense when your favour was presented to me but as i shall do myself the honor of waiting upon his excellency as soon as i hear of his arrival at alexandria and would sooner were i certain where to find him i shall decline saying any thing further on this head till then begging you will be pleased to assure him that i shall always retain a grateful sense of the favour with which he is pleased to honor me and that i should have embraced this opportunity of writing to him had i not recently addressed a congratulatory letter to him on his safe arrival in this country i flatter myself you will favour me in making a communication of these sentiments you do me a singular favour in proposing an acquaintance it cannot but be attended with the most flattering prospects of intimacy on my part as you may already perceive by the familiarity and freedom with which i now enter upon this correspondence a freedom which even if it is disagreeable you must excuse as i may lay the blame of it at your door for encouraging me to throw off that restraint which otherwise might have been more obvious in my deportment on such an occasion     the hope of shortly seeing you will be an excuse for my not adding more than that i shall endeavour to approve myself worthy of your friendship and that i beg to be esteemed your most obedient servant george washington   april      mount vernon robert orme to robert orme mount vernon   april      dear sir the arrival of a good deal of company among whom is my mother alarmed at the report of my intentions to attend your fortunes prevents me the pleasure of waiting upon you today as i had intended  i therefore beg that you will be kind enough to make my compliments and excuse to the general who i hope to hear is greatly recovered from his indisposition and recruited sufficiently to prosecute his journey to annapolis i find myself much embarrassed with my affairs having no person in whom i can confide to entrust the management of them with notwithstanding i am determined to do myself the honour of accompanying you upon this proviso that the general will be kind enough to permit my return as soon as the active part of the campaign is at an end if it is desired or if there should be a space of inaction long enough to admit a visit to my home that i may be indulged in coming to it     i need not add how much i should be obliged by joining you at wills creek instead of doing it at an earlier period and place  these things sir in whatever light they may appear to you at first sight will not i hope be thought unreasonable when it is considered how unprepared i am at present to quit a family and an estate i was just about to settle and which is in the utmost confusion i have enclosed you a letter from colonel fairfax to governor shirley which with his compliments he desired might be given to that gentleman he also sends his blessing to you and desires that by being a good boy you may merit more of them at present he entertains sanguine hopes of you this for your comfort i herewith send you a small map of the back country which though imperfect and roughly drawn for want of proper instruments may give you a better knowledge of the parts designated than you have hitherto had an opportunity of acquiring i shall do myself the honour of waiting upon the general as soon as i hear of his return from annapolis my compliments attend him mr shirley c and i am c     george washington  0 april      mount vernon john robinson to john robinson  mount vernon  0 april      dear sir i little expected when i wrote you last that i should so soon engage in another campaign but in doing it i may be allowed to claim some merit if it is considered that the sole motive which invites me to the field is the laudable desire of serving my country and not the gratification of any ambitious or lucrative plans this i flatter myself will manifestly appear by my going a volunteer without expectation of reward or prospect of attaining a command as i am confidently assured it is not in general braddocks power to give a commission that i would accept perhaps with many others the above declaration might be construed into selfapplause which unwilling to lose i proclaim myself but by you sir i expect it will be viewed in a different light because you have sympathized in my disappointments and lent your friendly aid to reinstate me in a suitable command the recollection of which can never be lost upon a mind that is not insensible of but always ready to acknowledge obligations this is the reason why i am so much more unreserved in the expression of my sentiments to you than i should be to the world whose censures and criticisms often place good designs in a bad light but to be ingenuous i must confess i had other intentions in writing you this letter for if there is any merit in my case i am unwilling to lose it among     my friends who without this exposition of facts might conceive that some advantageous offers had engaged my services when in reality the case is otherwise for i expect to be a considerable loser in my private affairs by going it is true i have been importuned to make this campaign by general braddock as a member of his family conceiving i suppose that the small knowledge i have had an opportunity of acquiring of the country indians c was worthy of his notice and might be useful to him in the progress of this expedition colo carter burwell  last assembly upon hearing that i had lost  0 odd pounds during my acting as paymaster desired i would petition the committee of war to have it refunded assuring me at the same time that he would use his endeavors that the matter should be attended to i declined it then thinking it might not be well received as i had been allowed a commission but if he should propose it at a future meeting and it does not appear to carry with it the face of unreasonableness i hope you will do me the favour to second him  i must own after meeting with the indulgencies i did i should not have asked this had it not been proposed by a member and had i not been so considerable a loser in the service in valuable papers clothing horses and several other things some of     which and of no inconsiderable value i carried out entirely for the publick use and forbore mentioning of it before as i knew you were greatly pestered with complaints of this sort from officers that were less able to bear them tho more inconsiderable than mine for i had unfortunately got my baggage from wills creek but a few days before the engagement in which i also had a valuable servant wounded who died soon after i thought it expedient just to mention these facts that you might turn them to any advantage you see proper or to drop it altogether if you think the application is at all improper i heartily wish a happy issue to all your resolves c george washington  0 april      mount vernon william byrd to william byrd mount vernon  0 april      dear sir i am sorry it was not in my power to wait upon you at westover last christmas i enjoyed much satisfaction in the thought of doing it when an unexpected accident put it entirely out of my power to comply either with my promise or inclination both of which prompted me to make the visit i am now preparing for and shall in a few days set off to serve in the ensuing campaign with different views however from those i had before for here if i can gain any credit or if i am entitled to the least countenance and esteem it must be from serving my country without fee or reward for i can truly say i have no expectation of either to merit     its esteem and the good will of my friends is the sum of my ambition having no prospect of attaining a commission being well assured it is not in genl braddocks power to give such an one as i would accept of the command of a company is the highest commission vested in his gift he was so obliging as to desire my company this campaign has honoured me with particular marks of his esteem and kindly invited me into his family—a circumstance which will ease me of expences that otherwise must have accrued in furnishing stores camp equipage c whereas the cost will now be easy comparatively speaking as baggage horses tents and some other necessaries will constitute the whole of the charge yet to have a family just settling and in the confusion and disorder mine is in at present is not a pleasing thing and may be hurtful but be this as it may it shall be no hindrance to my making this campaign george washington    april      mount vernon william fairfax to william fairfax mount vernon    april      dear sir i cannot think of quitting fairfax  without embracing this last opportunity of bidding you farewell i shall this day set off for wills creek where i expect to meet the general and to stay i fear too long as our march must be regulated by the slow movements of the train which i am sorry to say will be tedious very tedious indeed as i have long   0 predicted though few believed alexandria has been honored with five governors in consultation a favorable presage i hope not only of the success of this expedition but of the future greatness of this town for surely such a meeting must have been occasioned by the commodious and pleasant situation of this place which prognosticates population and the increase of a now flourishing trade  i have had the honor to be introduced to the several governors and of being well received by them all especially mr shirley whose character and appearance have perfectly charmed me as i think his every word and action discover in him the gentleman and politician i heartily wish the same unanimity may prevail amongst us as appeared to exist between him and his assembly when they to expedite the business and to forward his journey hither sat till eleven and twelve oclock every night it will be needless as i know your punctuality requires no stimulus to remind you of an affair about which i wrote some time ago therefore i shall only beg my compliments to mr nicholas and his lady and to all friends who think me worthy of their inquiries i am c      george washington   may      winchester william fairfax to william fairfax winchester   may      dear sir i overtook the general at frederick town in maryland from thence we proceeded to this place where we shall remain till the arrival of the second division of the train which we hear left alexandria on tuesday last after that we shall continue our march to wills creek from whence it is imagined we shall not stir till the latter end of this month for want of wagons and other conveniences to transport our baggage c over the mountains you will naturally conclude that to pass through maryland when no object required it was an uncommon and extraordinary route for the general and colonel dunbars regiment to this place the reason however was obvious those who promoted it had rather that the communication should be opened that way than through virginia but i believe the eyes of the general are now open and the imposition detected consequently the like will not happen again  please to make my compliments     to colo g to whom i shall write by the next opportunity and excuse haste i am c george washington   may      winchester john a washington to john a washington  winchester   may      dear brother a very fatiguing ride and long round about brought me to the general the day i parted with you at fredericktown this is a small village    miles below the blue ridge on the maryland side of the potowmack from thence we proceeded to this place where we have halted since saturday last and shall depart for willscreek tomorrow i find there is no probability of marching the army from wills creek till the latter end of this month or the first of next you may easily guess then how heavily time will hang upon my hands i have met with much complaisance in this family especially from the general whom i hope to please without ceremonious attentions or difficulty for i may add it cannot be done with them as he uses and requires less ceremony than you can easily conceive      i have ordered the horse gist to bullskin and my own here if serviceable otherwise you must have both carried down when countess is sent up i have conceived a good opinion of the horse gist therefore i hope you will not let him want for proper care and good usage if he should be sent instead of the greys which will be the case if they are able to perform the journey i hope you will have frequent opportunities to particularize the state of my affairs which will administer much satisfaction to a person in my situation at present i have nothing to add but my compliments to all friends particularly to the worthy family at belvoir who i hope are in good health george washington    may      fort cumberland major john carlyle to major john carlyle fort cumberland    may      sir— i overtook the general at fredericktown in maryland and proceeded with him by way of winchester to this place  which gave him a good opportunity to see the absurdity of the route and of damning it very heartily colo dunbars regiment was also obliged to recross at connogogee and come down within six miles of winchester to take the new road to wills creek which from the absurdity of it was laughable enough we are to halt here till forage can be brought from philadelphia which i suppose will introduce the month of june and then we are to proceed upon our     tremendous undertaking of transporting the heavy artillery over the mountains which i believe will compose the greatest difficulty of the campaign for as to any apprehensions of the enemy i think they are more to be provided against than regarded as i fancy the french will be obliged to draw their force from the ohio to repel the attacks in the north under the command of governour shirley c who will make three different attempts immediately     george washington    may      fort cumberland fairfax to mrs fairfax fort cumberland    may      dear madam i have at last with great pains and difficulty discovered the reason why mrs wardrope is a greater favorite of genl braddock than mrs f—x and met with more respect at the review in alexandria the cause i shall communicate after having rallied you upon neglecting the means which produced the effect and what do you think they were why nothing less i assure you than a present of delicious cake and potted woodcocks which so affected the palate as to leave a deep impression upon the hearts of all who tasted of them how then could the general do otherwise than admire not only the charms but the politeness of this lady we have a favourable prospect of halting here three weeks or a month longer for waggons horses and forage it is easy to conceive therefore that my situation will not be very pleasant and agreeable     when i dreaded this before i came out more than all the other incidents which might happen during the campaign    george washington    may      fort cumberland john a washington to john a washington fort cumberland    may      dear brother as wearing boots is quite the mode and mine are in a declining state i must beg the favor of you to procure me a pair that is good and neat and send them to major carlyle who i hope will contrive to forward them as quickly as my necessity requires i see no prospect of moving from this place soon as we have neither horses nor wagons enough and no forage for them to subsist upon except what is expected from philadelphia therefore i am well convinced that the trouble and difficulty we must encounter in passing the mountain for want of proper conveniences will equal all the other difficulties of the campaign for i conceive the march of such a train of artillery in these roads to be a tremendous undertaking as to any danger from the enemy i look upon it as trifling for i believe the french will be obliged to exert their utmost force to repel the attacks to the northward where governour shirley and others with a body of  000 men will annoy their settlements and attempt their forts the general has appointed me one of his aidsdecamp  in which character i shall serve this campaign     agreeably enough as i am thereby freed from all commands but his and give his orders to all which must be implicitly obeyed i have now a good opportunity and shall not neglect it of forming an acquaintance which may be serviceable hereafter if i find it worth while to push my fortune in the military line i have wrote to my two female correspondents  by this opportunity one of which letters i have enclosed to you and beg your deliverance of it i shall expect a particular account of all that has happened since my departure i am dear jack your most affectionate brother  may the   th i was sent to colo hunter  for a supply of money £ 000 sterlg and arrived as far as winchester on my way thither on the day following from whence i dispatched an express to him fearing he might be out to provide that sum and to meet me with it at williamsburgh proceeded myself thro fairfax where i was detained a day in getting horses at claybourns ferry the   d i met the express i had sent as he was returning who brought a verbal message from governour dinwiddie informing me that colo hunter was gone to the northward and that i would certainly be disappointed in my expectations of money with this i acquainted capt orme by letter and proceeded on to williamsburgh where i arrived the same day and met a mr belfour the partner of colo hunter with nearly the sum     desired which was completed the next day time enough for me to reach chissels ordinary on my return the   th i arrived at winchester and expected to have met the troop of lighthorse to escort me to the camp but being disappointed in that i engaged a guard of the militia with which i set out on the   th following and arrived at the camp the  0th george washington    may      winchester john a washington to john a washington winchester    may      dear brother i came to this place last night and was greatly disappointed in not finding the cavalry according to promise i am obliged to wait till it does arrive or till i can procure a guard from the militia either of which i suppose will detain me two days as you may with almost equal success attempt to raise the dead as the force of this country and that from wills creek cannot be expected in less than the forementioned time without they are now upon their march the drought in this country if possible exceeds what we see below so that it is very reasonably conjectured they wont make corn to supply the inhabitants and as for tobacco they have given up the expectation of making any the inhabitants of this place abound in news but as i apprehend it is founded upon as bare a foundation as some i heard on my way down i think it advisable to forego the recital till a little better authority confirms the report then you may expect to have a narrative of it     i should be glad to hear that you live in perfect harmony and good fellowship with the family at belvoir as it is in their power to be very serviceable upon many occasions to us as young beginners i would advise your visiting there often as one step towards it the rest if any more is necessary your own good sense will sufficiently dictate—for to that family i am under many obligations particularly to the old gentleman mrs fairfax and mrs spearing having expressed a wish to be informed of the time and manner of my reaching this place with my charge you may acquaint them that i met with no other interruption than what proceeded from the difficulty of getting horses after mrs f—xs grew lame i was obliged to get a fresh one every    or  0 miles which rendered the journey tedious i should have been more refreshed from the fatigues of my journey and my time would have been spent much more agreeably had i halted below instead of being delayed in this place but i little imagined i should have had occasion to wait for a guard which ought to have waited for me—if either must have waited at all    p s as i understand the county of fairfax is to be divided and that mr alexander intends to decline serving it i should be glad if you could come at colo fairfaxs intentions and let me know whether he purposes to offer himself as a candidate if he does not i should be glad to take a poll if i thought my chance tolerably good majr carlyle mentioned it to me in williamsburgh     in a bantering way and asked how i would like it saying at the same time he did not know but they might send me when i might know nothing of the matter for one or tother of the counties i must confess i should like to go for either in that manner but more particularly for fairfax as i am a resident there i should be glad if you could discover maj carlyles real sentiments on this head also those of mr dalton ramsay mason c which i hope and think you may do without disclosing much of mine as i know your own good sense can furnish you with contrivances if you should attempt any thing in this matter pray let me know by the first opportunity how you have succeeded in it and how those gentlemen stand affected if they seem inclinable to promote my interest and things should be drawing to a crisis you then may declare my intentions and beg their assistance if on the contrary you find them more inclined to favour some other i would have the affair entirely dropped the revd mr greens and capt mccartys interests in this matter would be of consequence and i should be glad if you could sound their pulse upon that occasion conduct the whole till you are satisfied of the sentiments of those i have mentioned with an air of indifference and unconcern after that you may regulate your conduct accordingly to circumstances capt west the present burgess and our friend   0 jack west could also be serviceable if they had a mind to assist the interest of dear jack your loving brother  0 may      upon my return from williamsburgh i found that sr john st clair with maj chapman and a detachment of  00 men had marched to the little meadows in order to prepare the roads establish a small post and to lay a deposit of provisions there the  d of june mr spendelow discovered a communication from fort cumberland to the old road leading to the crossing of the youghiogany avoiding the enormous mountain which had proved so destructive to our waggonhorses this communication was opened along a branch of wills creek and finished by the  th when sr peter halket with the first brigade of the line began its march and encamped within a mile of the old road which is about   miles from the fort the same day this encampment was first called grove camp but was afterwards altered to that of spendelows camp this day also captn gatess independent company the remaining companies of the provincial troops and the whole park of artillery were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to march at an hours warning under the command of lieutenantcolonel burton and they accordingly did so on the  th following but with great difficulty got up to sir peter halkets brigade at grove or spendelows camp the same day this march from the number of waggons occasioned a council of war to be held upon the arrival of the general with colo dunbars regiment at this camp in this council it was determined to retrench the number of waggons and to increase the transportation by packhorses in order thereto the officers were called together and the genl represented to them the necessity there was to procure all the horses possible for his majestys service advised     them to send back such of their baggage as they could do without and apply the horses which by that means could be spared to carry provisions for the army this they accordingly did with great cheerfulness and zeal george washington   june      wills creek william fairfax to william fairfax camp at wills creek   june      honble sir i arrived with my charge safe in camp the  0th of last month after waiting a day and piece in winchester expecting the cavalry to escort me up in which being disappointed i was obliged to make use of a small guard of the militia of frederick county  the general by frequent breaches of contract has lost all patience and for want of that temper and moderation which should be used by a man of sense upon these occasions will i fear represent us in a light we little deserve for instead of blaming the individuals as he ought he charges all his disappointments to publick supineness and looks upon the country i believe as void of honour and honesty we have frequent disputes on this head which are maintained with warmth on both sides especially on his who is incapable of arguing without or giving up any point he asserts let it be ever so incompatible with reason or common sense      there is a line of communication to be opened from pennsylvania to the french fort duquesne along which we are to receive after a little time all our convoys of provisions c c and to give all manner of encouragement to a people who ought rather to be chastised for their insensibility to danger and disregard of their sovereigns expectation they it seems are to be the favoured people because they have furnished what their absolute interest alone induced them to do i e   0 wagons and an equivalent number of horses  major chapman with a detachment of  00 men     and the quartermastergeneral marched two or three days before i arrived here to open the roads and lay a deposite of provisions in a small fort which they are to erect at the little meadows tomorrow sir peter halket with the first brigade is to begin their march and on monday the general with the second will follow one hospital is filled with sick and the numbers increase daily with the bloody flux which has not yet proved mortal to many general innes has accepted of a commission to be governour of fort cumberland where he is to reside and will shortly receive another to be hangman or something of that kind and for which he is equally qualified by a letter received from governor morris of pennsylvania we have advice that a party of three hundred men passed oswego on their way to fort duquesne and that another and larger detachment was expected to pass that place every moment by the public accounts from pennsylvania we are assured that nine hundred men have certainly passed oswego to reinforce the french on ohio so that from these accounts we have reason to believe that we shall have more to do than to go up the hills and come down we are impatient to hear what the powers at home are doing whether peace or war is like to be the issue of all these preparations      george washington    june      youghiogany john a washington to john a washington youghiogany    june       dear brother immediately upon our leaving the camp at georges creek on the   th instant from whence i wrote to you i was seized with violent fevers and pains in my head which continued without intermission till the   d following when i was relieved by the generals absolutely ordering the physicians to give me dr jamess powders one of the most excellent medicines in the world for it gave me immediate ease and removed my fevers and other complaints in four days time  my illness was too violent to suffer me to ride therefore i was indebted to a covered wagon for some part of my transportation but even in this i could not continue far for the jolting was so great that i was left upon the road with a guard and necessaries to wait the arrival of colonel dunbars detachment which was two days march     behind us the general giving me his word of honor that i should be brought up before he reached the french fort this promise and the doctors threats that if i persevered in my attempts to get on in the condition i was my life would be endangered determined me to halt for the above detachment as the communication between this and wills creek must soon be too dangerous for single persons to pass it will render the intercourse of letters slow and precarious therefore i shall attempt and will go through if i have strength to give you an account of our proceedings of our situation and of our prospects at present which i desire you will communicate to colonel fairfax and others my correspondents for i am too weak to write more than this letter in the letter which i wrote to you from georges creek i acquainted you that unless the number of wagons was retrenched and the carryinghorses increased we never should be able to see duquesne  this in two days afterwards which was about the time they got to the little meadows with some of their foremost wagons and strongest teams they themselves were convinced of for they found that besides the almost impossibility of getting the wagons along at all they had often a rear of three or four miles in length and that the soldiers     guarding them were so dispersed that if we had been attacked either in front center or rear the part so attacked must have been cut off or totally routed before they could be sustained by any other corps at the little meadows there was a second council  called for there had been one before wherein it was again represented to the officers of the different corps the urgency for horses and how laudable a farther retrenchment of their baggage would be that the spare ones might be turned over for public service in order to encourage this i gave up my best horse which i have never heard of since and took no more baggage than half my portmanteau would easily contain it is said however that the numbers reduced by this second attempt were only from two hundred and ten or twelve to two hundred which had no perceivable effect the general before they met in council asked my private opinion concerning the expedition i urged it in the warmest terms i was able to push forward if we even did it with a small but chosen band with such artillery and light stores as were absolutely necessary leaving the heavy artillery baggage c with the rear division of the army to follow by slow and easy marches which they might do safely while we were advanced in front as one reason to support     this opinion i urged that if we could credit our intelligence the french were weak at the forks at present but hourly expected reinforcements which to my certain knowledge could not arrive with provisions or any supplies during the continuance of the drought which we were then experiencing as the buffalo river rivière aux bœufs down which was their only communication to venango must be as dry as we now found the great crossing of the youghiogany which may be passed dryshod this advice prevailed and it was determined that the general with one thousand two hundred chosen men and officers from all the different corps under the following field officers viz sir peter halket who acts as brigadier lieutenantcolonel gage lieutenantcolonel burton and major sparke with such a certain number of wagons as the train would absolutely require should march as soon as things could be got in readiness for them which was completed and we on our march by the   th leaving colonel dunbar and major chapman with the residue of the two regiments some independent companies most of the women and in short every thing not absolutely necessary behind carrying our provisions and other necessaries upon horses we set out with less than thirty carriages including those that transported the ammunition for the howitzers twelvepounders and sixpounders etc and all of them strongly horsed which was a prospect that conveyed infinite delight to my mind though i was excessively ill at the time but this prospect     was soon clouded and my hopes brought very low indeed when i found that instead of pushing on with vigor without regarding a little rough road they were halting to level every molehill and to erect bridges over every brook by which means we were four days getting twelve miles at this camp i was left by the doctors advice and the generals absolute orders as i have already mentioned without which i should not have been prevailed upon to remain behind as i then imagined and now believe i shall find it no easy matter to join my own corps again which is twentyfive miles advanced before us notwithstanding i had the generals word of honor pledged in the most solemn manner that i should be brought up before he arrived at fort duquesne they have had frequent alarms and several men have been scalped but this is done with no other design than to retard the march and to harass the men who if they are to be turned out every time a small party attacks the guards at night for i am certain they have not sufficient force to make a serious assault their ends will be accomplished by the gaining of time i have been now six days with colonel dunbars corps who are in a miserable condition for want of horses not having enough for their wagons so that the only method he has of proceeding is to march with as many wagons as those will draw and then halt till the remainder are brought up with the same horses which requires two days more and shortly i believe he will not be able to stir at all but there     has been vile management in regard to horses and while i am mentioning this i must not forget to desire that you will acquaint colonel george fairfax that i have made the most diligent enquiry after his man and horses but can hear nothing of either at least nothing that can be credited i was told that the fellow was taken ill upon the road while he was with sir john st clairs detachment the certainty of this i cannot answer for but believe there is nothing more certain than that he is not with any part of the army and unless the horses stray and make home themselves i believe there is a thousand to one against his ever seeing them again for i gave up a horse only one day and never could see or hear of him afterwards my strength wont admit me to say more though i have not said half what i intended concerning our affairs here business i shall not think of but depend solely upon your management of all my affairs not doubting but that they will be well conducted you may thank my friends for the letters i have received from them which tell them has not been one from any mortal since i left fairfax except yourself and mr dalton it is a specimen of their regard and kindness which i should endeavor to acknowledge and thank them for was i able and suffered to write all your letters to me i would have sent to mr cocks of winchester or to governor innes at fort cumberland that i may have the better chance of their coming safe to hand make my compliments to all who think me worthy of their enquiries   0 july  d—a serious inconvenience attended me in my sickness and that was the losing the use of my servant for poor john alton was taken about the same time that i was and with nearly the same disorder and was confined as long so that we did not see each other for several days he is also tolerably well recovered we are advanced almost as far as the great meadows and i shall set out tomorrow morning for my own corps with an escort of one hundred men which is to guard some provisions up so that my fears and doubts on that head are now removed i had a letter yesterday from orme who writes me word that they have passed the youghiogany for the last time that they have sent out parties to scour the country thereabouts and have reason to believe the french are greatly alarmed at their approach george washington  0 june      great crossing robert orme to robert orme great crossing  0 june      dear orme i came to this camp on thursday last with the rear of colonel dunbars detachment and should have continued on with his front today but was prevented by rain my fevers are very moderate and i hope near terminating when i shall have nothing to encounter but weakness which is excessive and the difficulty of getting to you arising therefrom but this i would not miss doing before you reach duquesne for five     hundred pounds however i have no doubt now of doing this as i am moving on slowly and the general has given me his word of honor in the most solemn manner that it shall be effected as the doctor thinks it imprudent for me to use much exercise for two or three days it will retard the rapidity of my movements therefore i should be glad to be advised of your marches from gists and how you are likely to get on for you may rest assured that colonel dunbar cannot move from his present encampment in less than two or three days and i believe really it will be as much as he possibly can do to reach the meadows at all so that you will be greatly advanced before him i am too weak to add more than my compliments to the general the family c and again to desire that you will oblige me in the above request and devise the most effectual means for me to join you i am dear orme your most obedient servant  the  th of july i rejoined in a covered waggon the advanced division of the army under the immediate command of the general on the  th i attended him on horseback tho very weak and low on this day he was attacked and defeated by a party of french and indians adjudged not to exceed  00 when all hope of rallying the dismayed troops and recovering the ground was expired our provisions and stores being given up i was ordered to dunbars camp     george washington    july      little meadows governor innes to governor innes at fort cumberland  little meadows    july      sir captain orme being confined to his litter and not well able to write has desired me to acknowledge the receipt of yours he begs the favor of you to have the room that the general lodged in prepared for colonel burton himself and captain morris who are all wounded also that some small place may be had convenient for cooking and if any fresh provision and other suitable necessaries for persons in their condition may be had that you will be kind enough to engage them he also begs that you will order the present which was sent by governor morris to the general and his family in the care of mr a le roy the steward who is sent on for that and other purposes  the horses that carry the wounded gentlemen in litters are so much fatigued that we dread their performance therefore it is desired that you will be kind enough to send out eight or ten fresh horses for their relief which will enable us to reach the fort this evening i doubt not but you have had an account of the poor generals death by some of the affrighted wagoners who ran off without taking leave i am sir your most obedient servant     george washington    july      fort cumberland governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort cumberland    july      honbl sir as i am favored with an opportunity i should think myself inexcusable was i to omit giving you some account of our late engagement with the french on the monongahela the  th instant we continued our march from fort cumberland to fraziers which is within   miles of duquesne without meeting any extraordinary event having only a straggler or two picked up by the french indians when we came to this place we were attacked very unexpectedly by about three hundred french and indians our numbers consisted of about thirteen hundred well armed men chiefly regulars who were immediately struck with such an inconceivable panick that nothing but confusion and disobedience of orders prevailed among them the officers in general behaved with incomparable bravery for which they greatly suffered there being near  0 killed and wounded—a large proportion out of the number we had the virginia companies behaved like men and died like soldiers for i believe out of three companies that were on the ground that day scarce thirty were left alive capt peyroney and all his officers down to a corporal were killed captn polson had almost as hard a fate for only one of his escaped in short the dastardly behaviour of the regular troops socalled  exposed those who were inclined to do     their duty to almost certain death and at length in despite of every effort to the contrary broke and ran as sheep before hounds leaving the artillery ammunition provisions baggage and in short everything a prey to the enemy and when we endeavoured to rally them in hopes of regaining the ground and what we had left upon it it was with as little success as if we had attempted to have stopped the wild bears of the mountains or rivulets with our feet for they would break by in despite of every effort that could be made to prevent it the general was wounded in the shoulder and breast of which he died three days after his two aidsdecamp were both wounded but are in a fair way of recovery colo burton and sr john st clair are also wounded and i hope will get over it sir peter halket with many other brave officers were killed in the field it is supposed that we had three hundred or more killed about that number we brought off wounded and it is conjectured i believe with much truth that two thirds of both received     their shot from our own cowardly regulars who gathered themselves into a body contrary to orders ten or twelve deep would then level fire and shoot down the men before them i tremble at the consequences that this defeat may have upon our back settlers who i suppose will all leave their habitations unless there are proper measures taken for their security colo dunbar who commands at present intends as soon as his men are recruited at this place to continue his march to philadelphia for winter quarters  consequently there will be no men left here unless it is the shattered remains of the virginia troops who are totally inadequate to the protection of the frontiers    george washington    july      fort cumberland john a washington to john a washington fort cumberland    july      dear brother as i have heard since my arrival at this place a circumstantial account of my death and dying speech i take this early opportunity of contradicting the first and of assuring you that i have not as yet composed the latter  but by the allpowerful dispensations     of providence i have been protected beyond all human probability and expectation for i had four bullets through my coat and two horses shot under me yet escaped unhurt altho death was levelling my companions on every side of me we have been most scandalously beaten by a trifling body of men but fatigue and want of time will prevent me from giving you any of the details until i have the happiness of seeing you at mount vernon which i now most ardently wish for since we are drove in thus far a weak and feeble state of health obliges me to halt here for two or three days to recover a little strength that i may thereby be enabled to proceed homewards with more ease you may expect to see me there on saturday or sunday senight which is as soon as i can well be down as i shall take my bullskin plantations  in my way pray give my compliments to all my friends i am dear jack your most affectionate brother      george washington   august      mount vernon robert jackson to robert jackson mount vernon   august      dear sir i must acknowledge you had great reason to be terrified with the first accounts that were given of our unhappy defeat and i must own i was not a little surprised to find that governor innes was the means of alarming the country with a report so extraordinary without having better confirmation of the truth than the story of an affrighted wagoner it is true we have been beaten shamefully beaten by a handful of men who only intended to molest and disturb our march victory was their smallest expectation but see the wondrous works of providence the uncertainty of human things we but a few moments before believed our numbers almost equal to the canadian force they only expected to annoy us yet contrary to all expectation and human probability and even to the common course of things we were totally defeated sustained the loss of every thing which they have got are enriched by it and accommodated by them this as you observe must be an affecting story to the colony and will no doubt license the tongues of people to censure those whom they think most blamable which by the by often falls very wrongfully i join very heartily with you in believing that when this story comes to be related in future annals it will meet with unbelief and indignation for had i not been witness to the fact on that fatal day i should scarce have given credit to it even now     whenever it suits you to come into fairfax i hope you will make your home at mount vernon please to give my compliments to all inquiring friends i assure you nothing could have added more to the satisfaction of my safe return than hearing of the friendly concern that has been expressed on my supposed death i am c george washington   august      mount vernon augustine washington to augustine washington  mount vernon   august      dear brother the pleasure of your company at mount vernon always did and always will afford me infinite satisfaction but at this time i am too sensible how needful the country is of the assistance of all its members to have a wish to hear that any are absent from the assembly i most sincerely wish that unanimity may prevail in all your councils and that a happy issue may attend your deliberations at this important crisis i am not able were i ever so willing to meet you in town for i assure you it is with some difficulty and with much fatigue that i visit my plantations in the neck so much has a sickness of five weeks continuance reduced me but tho it is not in my power to meet you there i can nevertheless assure you and others whom it may concern to borrow a phrase from governor innes that i am so little dispirited at what has happened that i am always ready     and always willing to render my country any services that i am capable of but never upon the terms i have done having suffered much in my private fortune besides impairing one of the best constitutions i was employed to go a journey in the winter when i believe few or none would have undertaken it and what did i get by it my expenses borne i then was appointed with trifling pay to conduct a handful of men to the ohio what did i get by this why after putting myself to a considerable expense in equipping and providing necessaries for the campaign i went out was soundly beaten lost them all—came in and had my commission taken from me or in other words my command reduced under pretence of an order from home i then went out a volunteer with general braddock and lost all my horses and many other things but this being a voluntary act i ought not to have mentioned this nor should i have done it was it not to show that i have been upon the losing order ever since i entered the service which is now near two years so that i think i cannot be blamed should i if i leave my family again endeavour to do it upon such terms as to prevent my suffering to gain by it being the least of my expectation i doubt not but you have heard the particulars of our shameful defeat which really was so scandalous that i hate to mention it you desire to know what artillery was taken in the late engagement it is easily told we lost all that we carried out excepting two sixpounders and a few cohorns that were left with colonel dunbar and the cohorns have   0 since been destroyed to expedite his flight you also ask whether i think the forces can march out again this fall i answer i think it impossible at least for them to do the french any damage unless it be by starving them for want of a proper train of artillery yet they may be very serviceable in erecting small fortresses at convenient places to deposit provisions in by which means the country will be eased of an immense expense in the carriage and it will also be a means of securing a retreat if we should be put to the rout again the success of this tho will depend greatly upon what governor shirley does at niagara for if he succeeds their communication with canada will be entirely cut off it is impossible for me to guess at the number of recruits that may be wanting as that must depend altogether upon the strength of the french on the ohio which to my great astonishment we were always strangers to i thank you very heartily for your kind offer of a chair and for your goodness in sending my things and after begging you to excuse the imperfections of the above which in part are owing to my having much company that hurries me i shall conclude dear sir your most affectionate brother george washington    august      mount vernon mary washington to mrs mary washington mount vernon    august      honored madam if it is in my power to avoid going to the ohio again i shall but if the command is pressed upon     me by the general voice of the country and offered upon such terms as cannot be objected against it would reflect dishonor upon me to refuse and that i am sure must or ought to give you greater uneasiness than my going in an honorable command for upon no other terms i will accept of it at present i have no proposals made to me nor have i any advice of such an intention except from private hands george washington    august      mount vernon warner lewis to warner lewis mount vernon    august      dear sir after returning you my most sincere and grateful thanks for your kind condolence on my late indisposition and for the generous and give me leave farther to say partial opinion you have entertained of my military abilities i must express my concern for not having it in my power to meet you and other friends who have signified their desire of seeing me in williamsburg      your letter only came to hand at nine last night and you inform me that the assembly will break up the latter end of the week which allows a time too short in which to perform a journey of a hundred and sixty miles especially by a person in my weak and feeble condition for altho i am happily recovered from the disorder which brought me to so low an ebb by a sickness of nearly five weeks continuance yet my strength is not returned to me had i got timely notice i would have attempted the ride by slow and easy journeys if it had been only for the satisfaction of seeing my friends who i flatter myself from what you say are kind enough to sympathize in my good and evil fortunes the chief reason next to indisposition that prevented me from coming down to this assembly was a determination not to offer my services and that determination proceeded from the following reasons first a belief that i could not get a command upon such terms as i should incline to accept for i must confess to you that i never will quit my family injure my fortune and above all impair my health to run the risk of such changes and vicissitudes as i have met with but shall expect if i am employed again to have something certain again was i to accept the command i should insist upon some things which ignorance and inexperience made me overlook before particularly that of having the officers appointed in some measure with my advice and with my concurrence for i must add i think a commanding officer not having this liberty appears to me     to be a strange thing when it is considered how much the conduct and bravery of an officer influence the men how much a commanding officer is answerable for the behaviour of the inferior officers and how much his good or ill success in time of action depends upon the conduct of each particular one especially too in this kind of fighting where being dispersed each and every of them at that time has a greater liberty to misbehave than if he were regularly and compactly drawn up under the eyes of his superior officer on the other hand how little credit is given to a commander who after a defeat in relating the cause of it justly lays the blame on some individual whose cowardly behaviour betrayed the whole to ruin how little does the world consider the circumstances and how apt are mankind to level their vindictive censures against the unfortunate chief who perhaps merited least of the blame does it not appear then that the appointing of officers is a thing of the utmost consequence a thing that requires the greatest circumspection ought it to be left to blind chance or what is still worse to partiality should it not be left to a man whose life and what is still dearer whose honor depends upon their good behaviour there are necessary officers yet wanting for whom no provision has been made a small military chest is so absolutely necessary that it is impossible to do without nor can any man conduct an affair of this kind who has it not     these things i should expect if the appointment fell upon me but besides all these i had other reasons which withheld me from offering my services i believe our circumstances are brought to that unhappy dilemma that no man can gain any honor by conducting our forces at this time but will rather lose in his reputation if he attempts it for i am confident the progress of military movements must be slow for want of conveniences to transport our provisions ammunition and stores over the mountain occasioned in a great measure by the late ill treatment of the wagoners and horsedrivers who have received little compensation for their labor and nothing for their lost horses and wagons which will be an infallible cause of preventing all from assisting that are not compelled so that i am fully sensible whoever undertakes this command will meet with such insurmountable obstacles that he will soon be viewed in the light of an idle indolent body have his conduct criticised and meet perhaps with opprobrious abuse when it may be as much out of his power to avoid delays as it would be to command the raging seas in a storm viewing these things in the light i do has no small influence upon me as i am very apprehensive i should lose what at present constitutes the chief part of my happiness i e the esteem and notice which the country has been pleased to honor me with it is possible you may infer from what i have said     that my intentions are to decline at all events but my meaning is not so i am determined not to offer because to solicit the command and at the same time to make my proposals would be a little incongruous and carry with it the face of selfsufficiency but if the command should be offered the case is then altered as i should be at liberty to make such objections as reason and my small experience had pointed out  i hope you will make my compliments to all enquiring friends i am dear warner your most affectionate friend and obedient servant     george washington    september      alexandria john robinson to john robinson alexandria    september      sir after a small halt at fredricksburg to issue out orders to the recruiting officers appointed to that rendezvous i proceeded to this place in order to collect a return of the provisions clothing c that were lodged here an exact copy of which i herewith send you i find after the soldiers have their short allowances there will arise great inconveniences if stores of clothing are not laid in to supply their wants particularly shoes stockings and shirts for these are the least durable and mostly needed the method i would recommend is for the country to provide these things and lodge them or a convenient part thereof in the hands of the quartermaster who may be appointed to receive and deliver them to the soldiers by particular orders from their captains taking care to produce these orders and proper vouchers for the delivery each payday when it must be deducted out of that soldiers pay who receives it and then this i think will be a means of keeping them always provided and fit for duty preventing the officers from supplying the men which is     generally attended with misunderstandings and will also be a means of discouraging followers of the army from demanding such exorbitant prices as is usually practised on these occasions however i only offer this as the most efficacious method i can at present think of if any other more eligible can be found i should be glad to see it executed as something of the kind must be done otherwise the soldiers will be barefoot c which always pleads for exemption from duty and indeed in the approaching season will be a very just one you will be a judge when you see the returns what had best be done with the provisions the quantity is too great for the present consumption and to wagon it up can never answer the expense major carlyle thinks the west india market best as the returns will be in rum which he can soon turn into flour at the camp i am afraid i shall not be able to push things with vigor this fall for want of a commissary who will act with spirit mr dick seems determined not to enter into any further contracts unless he is better supported or till he meets the committee in october by which time the best season for engaging beef will be almost over and the governor by the advice of sir john st clair expressed just as i was coming away his desire of having him continued so that i am entirely ignorant how to act the making of contracts myself is foreign to my duty neither have i time and to see the service suffer will give me infinite uneasiness as i would gladly conduct every thing as far as     i am capable with life and spirit which never can be done without a fund of money is lodged in camp for defraying the contingent charges  as i believed it difficult to get all the clothing in any one part of the country i engaged it where i could and have got shoes stockings shirts and hats enough upon tolerable good terms as you may see by the enclosed major carlyle is also willing to engage one hundred complete suits as good as those imported for three pounds or less which i have acquainted the governor of and believe it to be as cheap as can be got below as it is the making chiefly that occasions the difference between the imported and those provided here i am c      george washington   october      fredericksburg governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fredericksburg   october      sir i arrived at this place in less than three hours after i wrote you from colonel baylors and some small time after arrived also colonel stephen who gives a worse account than he related in his letter but as he is the bearer of this i shall be less prolix referring to him for particulars i shall set out this evening for winchester where i expect to be joined by the recruits from alexandria and this place as soon as they can possibly march that distance also by one hundred men from prince william and frederick and i have wrote to fairfax county desiring that a troop of horse may hold themselves in readiness to march at an hours warning so that i doubt not but with the assistance of these i shall be able to repulse the enemy if they are still committing their outrages upon the inhabitants we are at a loss for want of almost every necessary tents kettles arms ammunition cartridgepaper c c we are distressed for therefore i hope as your honor did not send to philadelphia for them you will if possible endeavour to get them below and send them by the first opportunity to this place or alexandria with orders that they may be forwarded immediately to winchester   0 i must again take the liberty of mentioning to your honor the necessity there is of putting the militia when they are drawn out into actual service under better regulation than they are at present as well as there is of putting us under a military law  otherwise we shall only be a burthensome charge to the country and the others will prove its ruin that this may not appear an unmeaning expression i shall refer your honor to lieutenantcolonel stephen who can give you some late proofs of their disobedience and inconsistent behaviour i find i cannot possibly be in williamsburg as these affairs will engage some time till the sixth seventh or eighth of november when i should be glad to meet a committee in order to settle with them and your honor some points that are very necessary for the good of the expedition colonel stephen has orders to receive some money below if he can that we may be enabled to pay the troops and to keep them in spirits and to answer such immediate charges as cannot be dispensed with until i come down and i should be glad if your honor would order him to repair therewith as soon as he has done his business with the committee to winchester and from thence with a proper guard to fort cumberland i hope the treasury will have a sufficient sum of money prepared against i come down that i meet with no great delay     i should be glad your honor would give colonel stephen all the assistance you can in getting the money there are about seventy recruits at this place and i left twentyfive at alexandria which i suppose are augmented before this by officers who i am sorry to say have paid slight regard to orders in not being in at the time appointed  st of october the most flagrant proof of this is captain harrison who i have heard nothing of tho he had positive orders to be here at the aforesaid time i am c george washington  0 october      winchester andrew montour to andrew montour winchester  0 october      dear montour i wrote some time ago a letter of invitation from fort cumberland desiring yourself your family and friendly indians to come and reside among us but that letter not coming to hand i am induced to send a second express with the same invitation being pleased that i have it in my power to do something for you on a better footing than ever it has been done i was greatly enrapturd when i heard you were at the head of  00 indians on a march toward venango being satisfied that your hearty attachment to our glorious cause your courage of which i have had very great proofs and your presence among the indians would animate their just indignation to do something noble something worthy themselves and honourable to you i hope you will use your interest as i know you have much in bringing our brothers once more to our service     assure them as you truly may that nothing which i can do shall be wanting to make them happy assure them also that as i have the chief command i am invested with power to treat them as brethren and allies which i am sorry to say they have not been of late recommend me kindly to our good friend monocatoocha and others tell them how happy it would make conotocaurius to have an opportunity of taking them by the hand at fort cumberland and how glad he would be to treat them as brothers of our great king beyond the waters flattering myself that you will come i doubt not but youl bring as many of them with you as possible as that will afford me what alone i want that is an opportunity of doing something equal to your wishes i am dear montour your real friend and assured hble servt n b i doubt not but you have heard of the ravages committed on our frontiers by the french indians and i suppose by the french themselves i am now on my march against them and hope to give them cause of repenting their rashness  george washington    october      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    october      honble sir as i think it my indispensable duty to inform you particularly of my proceedings and to give the most     plain and authentic account from time to time of our situation i must acquaint your honor that immediately after giving the necessary orders at fredericksburg and despatching expresses to hurry the recruits from alexandria i rid post to this place passing by lord fairfaxs who was not at home but here where i arrived yesterday about noon and found every thing in the greatest hurry and confusion by the back inhabitants flocking in and those of the town removing out which i have prevented as far as it was in my power i was desirous of proceeding immediately at the head of some militia to put a stop to the ravages of the enemy believing their numbers to be few but was told by colonel martin who had attempted to raise the militia for the same purpose that it was impossible to get above twenty or twentyfive men they having absolutely refused to stir choosing as they say to die with their wives and families finding this expedient likely to prove abortive i sent off expresses to hurry the recruits from below and the militia from fairfax prince william c which lord fairfax had ordered out and i also hired spies to go out and see to discover the numbers of the enemy and to encourage the rangers who we were told are blocked up by the indians in small fortresses but if i may offer my opinion i believe they are more encompassed by fear than by the enemy i have also impressed wagons and sent them to conococheague for flour musketshots and flints powder and trifling quantity of paper bought at extravgant prices for cartridges i expect from below six or eight smiths who are now at work repairing the firearms     that are here which are all that we have to depend on a man was hired the   th of last month to do the whole but neglected and was just moving off in wagons to pennsylvania i impressed his wagons and compelled him by force to assist in this work in all things i meet with the greatest opposition no orders are obeyed but what a party of soldiers or my own drawn sword enforces without this a single horse for the most urgent occasion cannot be had to such a pitch has the insolence of these people arrived by having every point hitherto submitted to them however i have given up none where his majestys service requires the contrary and where my proceedings are justified by my instructions nor will i do it unless they execute what they threaten i e to blow out my brains i have invited the poor distressed people who were drove from their habitations to lodge their familys in some place of security and to join our partys in scouring the woods where the enemy lie and believe some will cheerfully assist i also have taken and shall continue to take every previous step to forward the march of the recruits c so soon as they arrive here and your honor may depend that nothing that is in my power to do shall be wanting for the good of the service i would again hint the necessity of putting the militia under a better regulation had i not mentioned it twice before and a third time may seem impertinent but i must once more beg leave to declare for here i am more immediately concerned that unless the assembly will enact     a law to enforce the military law in all its parts  that i must with great regret decline the honour that has been so generously intended me and for this only reason i do it—the foreknowledge i have of failing in every point that might justly be expected from a person invested with full power to exert this authority i see the growing insolence of the soldiers the indolence and inactivity of the officers who are all sensible how confined their punishments are in regard to what they ought to be in fine i can plainly see that under our present establishment we shall become a nuisance an insupportable charge to our country and never answer any one expectation of the assembly and here i must assume the freedom to express some surprise that we alone should be so tenacious of our liberty as not to invest a power where interest and politicks so unanswerably demand it and from whence so much good must consequently ensue do we not see that every nation under the sun find their account therein and without it no order no regularity can be observed why then should it be expected from us who are all young and inexperienced to govern and keep up a proper spirit of discipline without laws when the best and most experienced can scarcely do it with them then if we consult our interest i am sure it is loudly called for for i can confidently assert that money expended in recruiting cloathing arming maintaining and subsisting soldiers who have deserted has cost the country an immense sum which might have been prevented     were we under restraints that would terrify the soldiers from such practices one thing more on this head i will recommend and then quit the subject i e to have the inhabitants liable to certain heavy fines or corporal punishments for entertaining of deserters and a reward for taking them up if this was done it would be next to an impossibility for a soldier to escape but on the contrary as things now stand they are not only seduced to run away but are also harboured and assisted with every necessary means to do it sunday noon—last night arrived an express just spent with fatigue and fear reporting that a party of indians were seen about twelve miles off at the plantation of one isaac julian and that the inhabitants were flying in the most promiscuous manner from their dwellings i immediately ordered the town guards to be strengthened perkinss lieutenant to be in readiness with his companies some recruits who had only arrived about half an hour before to be armed and sent two men well acquainted with the roads to go up that road and lay in wait to see if they could discover the number and motion of the indians that we might have timely notice of their approach this morning before we could parade the men to march upon the last alarm arrived a second express ten times more terrified than the former with information that the indians had got within four miles of the town and were killing and destroying all before them for that he himself had heard constant firing and shrieks of the unhappy murdered     upon this i immediately collected what force i could which consisted of twentytwo men recruited for the rangers and nineteen of the militia and marched directly to the place where these horrid murders were said to be committed when we came there whom should we find occasioning all this disturbance but three drunken soldiers of the lighthorse carousing firing their pistols and uttering the most unheardof imprecations these we took and marched prisoners to town where we met the men i sent out last night and learned that the party of indians discovered by isaac julian proved to be a mulatto and negro seen hunting of cattle by his child who alarmed the father and the father the neighborhood these circumstances are related only to show what a panic prevails among the people how much they are alarmed at the most usual and customary cries and yet how impossible it is to get them to act in any respect for their common safety as an instance of this—colonel fairfax who arrived in town when we were upon a scout immediately sent to a noble captain not far off to repair with his company forthwith to winchester with coolness and moderation this great captain answered that his wife family and corn were all at stake so were his soldiers therefore it was impossible for him to come such is the example of the officers such the behaviour of the men and upon such circumstances depends the safety of our country monday morning   th—the men i hired to bring intelligence from the branch returned last night with     letters from captain ashby and the other parties there by which i learn that the indians are gone off scouts having been dispersed upon those waters for several days without discovering tracks or other signs of the enemy i am also informed that it is believed their numbers amounted to about one hundred and fifty that seventy of our men are killed and missing and that several houses and plantations are destroyed but not so great havoc made as was represented at first the rangers and a small company of militia ordered there by lord fairfax i am given to understand intend to march down on monday next who will be immediately followed by all the inhabitants of those parts that had gathered together under their protection i have therefore sent peremptory orders to the contrary but what obedience will be paid to them a little time will reveal i have ordered those men that were recruited for the rangers to join their respective companies and there is also a party of militia marched with them under the command of captain harden captain waggener is this instant arrived with thirty recruits which he marched from bellhaven in less than three days—a great march indeed major lewis and his recruits from fredericksburg i expect in tomorrow when with these and twentytwo of captain bells now here i shall proceed by quick marches to fort cumberland in order to strengthen that garrison besides these i think it absolutely necessary that there should be two or three companies exclusively     of rangers to guard the potomac waters until such time as our regiment is completed and indeed these rangers and volunteer companies in augusta with some of their militia should be properly disposed of on these frontiers for fear of an attack from that quarter this though is submitted to your honors judgment and waits your orders for execution if thought expedient captain waggener informs me that it was with difficulty he passed the ridge for crowds of people who were flying as if every moment was death he endeavoured but in vain to stop them they firmly believing that winchester was in flames i shall send expresses down the several roads in hopes of bringing back the inhabitants who are really frightened out of their senses i despatched an express immediately upon my arrival at this place with a copy of the enclosed to andrew montour who i heard was at a place called long island  with three hundred indians to see if he could engage him and them to join us the letter savours a little of flattery c c but this i hope is justifiable on such occasions i also wrote to gist acquainting him with the favor you intended him and desired he would repair home in order to raise his companies of scouts  i shall defer writing to the speaker and committee upon any other head than that of commissary still hoping to be down by the time mentioned in my last  00 provided no new disturbances happen having some points to settle that i am uneasy and urgent about i have been obliged to do duty very foreign to my own but that i shall never hesitate about when the good of the service requires it in a journey from fort cumberland to fort dinwiddie which i made purposely to see the situation of our frontiers how the rangers were posted and how troops might be disposed of for the defence of the country i purchased six hundred and fifty beeves to be delivered at fort cumberland by the  st of november at ten shillings per hundred weight except a few that i was obliged to give eleven shillings for and have my own bonds now out for the performance of covenants this being the commissarys business who i am sorry to say has hitherto been of no use but of disservice to me in neglecting my orders and leaving this place without flour and fredericksburg without any provisions for the recruits although he had timely notice given i must beg that if mr dick will not act some other person may be appointed that will for if things remain in this uncertain situation the season will pass without having provision made for the winter or summers campaign whoever acts as commissary should be sent up immediately about salting the provisions c it will be difficult i believe to provide a quantity of pork i enquired as i rode thro hampshire augusta c and could not hear of much for sale most of the new appointed officers have been extremely deficient in their duties by not repairing to  0  their rendezvouses according to appointment captn mckenzie lieut king and ensigns miller and dean who were ordered to send their recruits to alexandria by the first of october were not arrived when captn waggener left that place nor have we heard any thing of captn harrison whose recruits should have been at fredericksburg by the same time and captn bell only sent his here on saturday last if these practices are allowed of we may as well quit altogether for no duty can ever be carried on if there is not ye greatest punctuality observed one thing always depending so immediately upon another i have appointed captain george mercer whose seniority entitled him to it my aiddecamp and mr kirkpatrick of alexandria my secretary a young man bred to business of good character well recommended and a person of whose abilities i had not the least doubt i hope your honor will be kind enough to despatch colonel stephen with orders to repair hither immediately and excuse the prolixity of this i was willing to give a circumstantial account of our situation that you may be the better enabled to judge what orders are necessary to give i am c winchester october         major lewis is just arrived and on thursday i shall begin my march to fort cumberland allowing the recruits one day to refresh themselves  0  advertisement     or    october      whereas divers timorous persons run through the country and alarm its inhabitants by false reports of the indians having attacked and destroyed the country—even winchester itself and that they are still proceeding this is to give notice to all people that i have great reason to believe that the indians who committed the late cruelties though no lower than the south branch are returned home as i have certain accounts that they have not been seen nor heard of these ten days past and i do advise all my countrymen not to be alarmed on every false report they may hear as they must now be satisfied from the many false ones that have been made but to keep to their homes and take care of their crops as i can venture to assure them that in a short time the frontiers will be so well guarded that no mischief can be done either to them or their plantations which must of course be destroyed if they desert them in so shameful a manner george washington    october      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    october      sir last night by the return of the express who went to captain montour i received the enclosed from mr harris at susquehanna  i think no means  0  should be neglected to preserve what few indians still remain in our interest for which reason i shall send mr gist as soon as he arrives which i expect will be today to harriss ferry  in hopes of engaging and bringing with him the belt of wampum and other indians that are at that place i shall further desire him to send an indian express to andrew montour to try if he cannot be brought with them  in however trifling light the french attempting to alienate the affections of our southern indians may at first appear i must look upon it as a thing of the utmost consequence that requires our greatest and most immediate attention i have often wondered at not hearing this was attempted before and had it noted among other memorandums to acquaint your honor with when i should come down the french policy in treating with the indians is so prevalent that i should not be in the least surprised were they to engage the cherokees catawbas c unless timely and vigorous measures are taken to prevent it a pusillanimous behaviour now will  0  ill suit the times and trusting to traders and common interpreters who will sell their integrity to the highest bidder may prove the destruction of these affairs i therefore think that if a person of distinction acquainted with their language is to be found his price should be come to at any rate if no such person can be had a man of sense and character to conduct the indians to any council that may be held or superintend any other matters will be found extremely necessary it is impertinent i own in me to offer my opinion in these affairs when better judges may direct but my steady and hearty zeal for the cause and the great impositions i have known practised by the traders c upon these occasions would not suffer me to be quite silent i have heard from undoubted authority that some of the cherokees who have been introduced to us as sachems and princes by this interpreter who shares the profits have been no other than common hunters and bloodthirsty villains we have no accounts yet of the militia from fairfax c this day i march with about one hundred men to fort cumberland yesterday an express informed me of eighty odd recruits at fredericksburg which i have ordered to proceed to this place but for want of that regularity being observed by which i should know where every officer c is my orders are only conditional and always confused  the  0  commissary is much wanted therefore i hope your honor will send him up immediately if not things will greatly suffer here whatever necessaries your honor gets below i should be glad to have sent to alexandria from whence they are much more handy than from fredericksburg besides as provision is lodged there and none at any other place it will be better for the men to be all sent there that can any ways conveniently for we have met with insufferable difficulties at fredericksburg and in our march from thence through neglect of the commissary who is greatly wanted up here therefore i hope your honor will order him george washington    november      fredericksburg adam stephen to lieutenantcolonel adam stephen fredericksburg    november      sir i came to this place on sunday last and intended to proceed immediately up  but receiving yours and other letters contradicting the reports lately transmitted determined me to go to alexandria where i shall wait a few days hoping to meet the express from general shirley to whom the governor sent for commissions for the fieldofficers   0  i beg that you will be particularly careful in seeing strict order observed among the soldiers as that is the life of military discipline we now have it in  0  our power to enforce obedience and obedience will be expected from us the men being subject to death as in military law the assembly have also offered a reward to all who will apprehend deserters and a severe punishment upon those who shall entertain or suffer them to pass also upon any constable who refuses to convey them to the company or troop to which they belong or shall suffer them to escape after such deserters are committed to his custody  these things with the articles of war and a proper exhortation i would have you read immediately to the men and see that it is frequently done hereafter i must desire that you will use all possible means to facilitate the salting our provisions and give the commissary such assistance of men c as he shall reasonably require the governor approves of the committees resolve in not allowing either the maryland or carolina companies to be supported out of our provisions this you are to make them acquainted with and in case any of the companies  0  should be discharged to use your utmost endeavours to enlist as many of the men as you can lieutenant mcmanners has leave to go to carolina if he desires it the assembly would make no alteration in our militia law nor would the governor order them to be drafted to complete our regiment so that the slow method of recruiting is likely to be our only means to raise the men i think could a brisk officer and two or three sergeants be sent among the militia stationed on the south branch they would have a probable chance of engaging many as some were inclinable in winchester to list doctor craik is expected round to alexandria in a vessel with medicines and other stores for the regiment so soon as he arrives i shall take care to despatch him to you the colonels byrd and randolph are appointed commissioners  and will set out very shortly with a present c to the country of the cherokees in order to engage them to our interest i am c george washington    november      alexandria adam stephen to lieutenantcolonel adam stephen alexandria    november      sir i received your two letters by jenkins last night and was greatly surprised to hear that commissary walker was not arrived at camp when he came away he set out from williamsburg about the   th instant  0  with orders to proceed immediately up but such disobedience of commands as i have generally met with is insufferable and shall not go unpunished the account you enclosed of the method of receiving the beef i suppose is customary but for want of judgment in those affairs i can neither applaud nor condemn it i am as much astonished as you were surprised at the quantity of salt said to be wanted for the provision but certain it is that if it or a greater quantity is absolutely necessary it must be had i have left a discretionary power in commissary walker to kill or winter the carolina beeves as the interest of service requires pray assist him with your advice and urge him on to make the necessary purchases of flour and pork in time the governor did not seem inclinable to promote the removal of the fort however the committee have lodged a discretionary power in my hands and have resolved to pay for all extraordinary labor i would therefore have as little labor lost at fort cumberland as possible at least until i come up which will be very shortly my stay here being only for a few days in order to receive recruits and hurry up the stores to winchester i believe those who say governor sharpe is to command can only wish it i do not know that general shirley has a power to appoint a chief to our forces—to regulars he may as to that affair of turning the storehouse into a dwellingroom i do not know what better answer to give than saying that this is one among the many instances that   0 might be offered of the inconvenience of having the fort in maryland as soon as i hear from governor shirley which is hourly expected i can then send a more determined answer there has been such total negligence among the recruiting officers in general such disregard of the service they were employed in and such idle proceedings that i am determined to send out none until we all meet when each officer shall have his own men and have only this alternative either to complete his number or lose his commission there are several officers who have been out six weeks or two months without getting a man spending their time in all the gayety of pleasurable mirth with their relations and friends not attempting nor having a possible chance of recruiting any but those who out of their inclination to the service will proffer themselves i should be glad to have ten or twelve wagons sent to this place for salt enough may be had here to load that number and it comes upon easier terms than at fredericksburg by sixpence or eight pence per bushel those stores at watkinss ferry should be hurried up as fast as the water affords opportunities if it were only to prevent disputes if the paymaster is at winchester and not on his way to fort dinwiddie order him down here immediately if he should be going with pay to captain hogg  he is to proceed with despatch but if he is at fort cumberland order him down to winchester to wait there until i arrive i am c     george washington   december      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria   december      honble sir i have sent the bearer captain john mercer who has accounts to settle with the committee to the treasurer for the balance of that ten thousand pounds and to acquaint your honor that meeting with letters at fredericksburg as i returned from williamsburg informing me that all was peaceable above and that nothing was so immediately wanting as salt i got what i could at that place and hastened on here to engage more to receive the recruits expected in and to wait the arrival of the vessel with arms c from james river in order to forward them up with the greater despatch the vessel is not yet arrived i have impatiently expected to hear the result of your honors letter to general shirley and wish that the delays may not prove ominous in that case i shall not know how to act for i can never submit to the command of captain dagworthy since you have honored me with the command of the virginia regiment c the country has sustained inconceivable losses by delaying the commissaries at williamsburg many of the carolina beeves are dead through absolute poverty and the chief part of them too poor to slaughter we are at a loss how to act for want of the mutiny bill and should be obliged to your honor if you will have fifty or a hundred printed and sent by the bearer  there is a clause in that bill which if you     are not kind enough to obviate it will prevent entirely the good intention of it that is delaying the execution of sentences until your honor shall be made acquainted with the proceedings of the court this at times when there is the greatest occasion for examples will be morally impossible i mean while we are on our march perhaps near the ohio when none but strong parties can pass with safety at all times it must be attended with great expense trouble and inconveniency this i represented to colonel corbin and some other gentlemen of the council when i was down who said that the objection would be removed by your honors giving blank warrants to be filled up as occasion should require this would effectually remedy all those evils and put things in their proper channel we suffer greatly for want of kettles those sent from below being tin are of short duration we shall also in a little time suffer as much for the want of clothing none can be got in these parts those which major carlyle and dalton contracted to furnish we are disappointed of shoes and stockings we have and can get more if wanted but nothing else i should be glad your honor would direct what is to be done in these cases and that you would be kind enough to desire the treasurer to send some part of the money in gold and silver were this done we might often get necessaries for the regiment in maryland or pennsylvania when they cannot be had here but with our money it is impossible our paper not passing there     the recruiting service goes on extremely slow  yesterday being a day appointed for rendezvousing at this place there came in ten officers with twenty men only if i had any other than paper money and you approved of it i would send to pennsylvania and the borders of carolina i am confident men might be had there your honor never having given any particular directions about the provisions i should be glad to know whether you would have more laid in than what will serve for twelve hundred men that i may give orders accordingly as i cannot now conceive that any great danger can be apprehended at fort cumberland this winter i am sensible that my constant attendance there cannot be so serviceable as riding from place to place making the proper dispositions and seeing that all our necessaries are forwarded up with despatch i therefore think it advisable to inform your honor of it hoping it will correspond with your own opinion i forgot to mention when i was down that mr livingston the fort major was appointed adjutant to our regiment i knew of none else whose long servitude in a military way had qualified better for the office he was appointed the   th of september captain mercers pay as aiddecamp seems yet doubtful i should be glad if your honor would fix it as so is captain stewarts if captain stewarts is increased i suppose all the officers belonging to     the lighthorse will expect to have theirs augmented also colonel stephen in a late letter discovered an inclination to go to the creek and cherokee indians this winter i told him where to apply if he had any such thoughts i believe on so useful a business he might be spared until the spring if your honor think proper to order the act of assembly for apprehending deserters and against harbouring them to be published every sunday in each parish church until the people are made acquainted with the law it would have a very good effect the commonalty in general err more through ignorance than design few of them are acquainted that such a law exists and there is no other certain way of bringing it to their knowledge there are a great many of the men that did once belong to our companies deserted from the regiments into which they were drafted that would now gladly return if they could be sure of indemnity if your honor would be kind enough to intimate this to general shirley or the colonels of those regiments it would be of service to us without leave we dare not receive them  i am c george washington    december      winchester adam stephen to lieutenantcolonel adam stephen winchester    december      sir captain john mercer only returned last night from williamsburg and brings no satisfactory answers to any thing i questioned the governor upon     the express that was sent to general shirley is returned without seeing him however the governor writes that he expects answers to his letters by colonel hunter who is now at new york and waits the arrival of the general at that place the governor is very strongly of the opinion that captain dagworthy has no right to contend for the command and in his letter he says after mentioning the return of the express and his expectancy of satisfactory letters but i am of opinion you might have obviated the inconsistent dispute with captain dagworthy by asking him if he did not command a provincial company by virtue of governor sharpes commission as that he had formerly from his majesty now ceases as he is not on the halfpay list if so the method you are to take is very obvious as your commission from me is greater than what he has and in williamsburg when i was down there both he and colonel fitzhugh told me that dagworthy could have no more pretensions to command me or either of the fieldofficers of the virginia regiment than we have to command general shirley and farther gave it as their opinion that as dagworthys was only a botchedup commission at best and as he commanded a provincial company and by virtue of a governors commission that he ought to be arrested for his presumption they say allowing his commission from the king to be valid     yet as he is not there by order of his majesty he can have no better pretensions than a visiting halfpay officer who transiently passes through the camp to assume the command i wish you would sound him on this head and hear how he will answer these things and let me know when you come down which i desire may be immediately as i want much to consult you upon several accounts the paymaster and commissary if he is not very much engaged must accompany you desire both to have their accounts settled and brought with them as that is necessary before i can give more money i have sent you one of the mutiny bills which i received from below but i think indeed i believe it is absolutely necessary as we still want the power to postpone trials until after your return also desire all the officers who have received money for recruiting to make up their accounts immediately and charge for no more men than have actually been received at the several rendezvouss allowance will be made for no others the arrears of pay for these officers and soldiers who have not received for the months of january and february are immediately to be made out and sent down by you with the recruiting accounts desire them to charge for no men but what are present as i can pay for no others now enclosed is a commission for captain waggener which i have neglected giving before so long as i have had it desire him as the command upon     your leaving the place will devolve upon him to be very circumspect in his duty and to see that the troops are duly drawn out and trained to their exercise and practised to bushfighting as i expect in a very few days to have the pleasure of seeing you i shall only add i am c      george washington   january      winchester robert hunter morris to robert hunter morris governor of pennsylvania winchester   january      honble sir i am sorry it has not been in my power to acknowledge the receipt of yours till now at the time that your letter came to winchester i was at williamsburg before i got back it was conveyed thither and so from place to place has it been tossing almost till this time there is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate a designing enemy and nothing that requires greater pains to obtain i shall therefore cheerfully come into any measures you can propose to settle a correspondence for this salutary end and you may depend upon receiving when the provinces are threatened the earliest and best intelligence that i can procure i sympathized in a general concern to see the inactivity of your province in a time of eminent danger but am pleased to find that a feeling sense of wrongs has roused the spirit of your martial assembly     to vote a sum which with your judicious application will turn to a general good  we took some pretty vigorous measures to collect a force upon our frontiers upon the first alarm which has kept us peaceable ever since how long this may last is uncertain since that force which were militia are disbanded and the recruiting service almost stagnated if you propose to levy troops and their destination     is not a secret i should be favored were i let into the scheme that we may act conjunctly so far as the nature of things will admit pray direct to me at alexandria to which place i design to go in about ten days from this i heartily wish you the compliments of the season i am c george washington   january      address to the officers of the virginia regiment    january             this timely warning of the effects of misbehaviour will i hope be instrumental in animating the younger officers to a laudable emulation in the service of their country not that i apprehend any of them can be guilty of offences of this nature but there are many other misdemeanors that will without due circumspection gain upon inactive minds and produce consequences equally disgraceful i would therefore earnestly recommend in every point of duty willingness to undertake and intrepid resolution to execute remember that it is the actions and not the commission that make the officer and that there is more expected from him than the title do not forget that there ought to be a time appropriated to attain this knowledge as well as to indulge pleasure and as we now have no opportunities to improve from example let us read for this   0 desirable end there is blands and other treatises which will give the wishedfor information i think it my duty gentlemen as i have the honour to preside over you to give this friendly admonition especially as i am determined as far as my small experience in service my abilities and interest of the service may dictate to observe the strictest discipline through the whole economy of my behaviour on the other hand you may as certainly depend upon having the strictest justice administered to all and that i shall make it the most agreeable part of my duty to study merit and reward the brave and deserving i assure you gentlemen that partiality shall never bias my conduct nor shall prejudice injure any but throughout the whole tenor of my proceedings i shall endeavour as far as i am able to reward and punish without the least diminution george washington    january      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria    january      honble sir major lewis being at winchester when your letter came to hand was immediately despatched to augusta to take upon him the command of the troops destined against the shawnese town  with     orders to follow such directions as he should receive from you this scheme though i am apprehensive will prove abortive as we are told that those indians are removed up the river into the neighbourhood of fort duquesne i have given all necessary orders for training the men to a proper use of their arms and the method of indian fighting and hope in a little time to make them expert and i should be glad to have your honors express commands either to prepare for taking the field or for guarding our frontiers in the spring because the steps for these two are very different i have already built two forts on pattersons creek which have engaged the chief of the inhabitants to return to the plantations and have now ordered captain waggener with sixty men to build and garrison two others on places i have pointed out high up on the south branch which will be a means of securing near an hundred miles of our frontiers exclusive of the command at fort dinwiddie on jacksons river and indeed without a much greater number of men than we have a visible prospect of getting i do not see how it is possible to think of passing the mountains or acting more than defensively this seems to be the full determination of the pennsylvanians so that there can be no hope of assistance from that quarter if we only act defensively i would most earnestly recommend the building of a strong fort at some convenient place in virginia as that in maryland not to say any thing of its situation which is extremely bad will ever be an eyesore to this colony     and attended with more inconveniences than it is possible to enumerate one instance of this i have taken notice of in a letter that accompanies this and many more i could recite were it necessary if we take the field there is no time to carry on a work of this kind but we should immediately set about engaging wagons horses forage packsaddles etc and here i cannot help remarking that i believe it will be impossible to get wagons or horses sufficient without the old score is paid off as the people are really ruined for want of their money and complain justly of their grievances i represented in my last the inconveniences of the late act of assembly which obliges us first to send to your honor for a commission to hold general courtsmartial and then to delay execution until a warrant can be had from williamsburg and i hope you will take the thing into consideration we have several deserters now on hand whom i have taken by rigorous measures and who should be made examples to others as this practice is continued with greater spirit than ever unless clothing is soon provided the men will be unfit for any kind of service and i know of no expedient to procure them but by sending to the northward as cloth cannot be had here i left among other returns an exact account of the clothing at every place when i was in williamsburg i shant care to lay in provisions for more than a thousand men unless i have your honors orders we have put out such of the beeves as were unfit for     slaughtering if they survive the winter they may be useful in the summer ensign polson having received a commission in colonel gages regiment makes a vacancy here which with your approbation will be filled by mr dennis mccarthy whom you once appointed a captain he has continued a volunteer ever since and has recruited several men into the service and i hope your honor will allow me the liberty as you once promised me of filling up the vacancies as they happen with the volunteers who serve with that expectation we have several with us that seem to be very deserving young gentlemen i shall observe the strictest justice in promoting them according to their merit and their time of entering the service i have ordered captn hog to render immediately a fair account to the company of the money sent him he was ordered to lay in provisions for only    months captn stewart has recruited his complement of men i should be glad to know whether he is to complete his horse against the spring and provide accoutrements i have been obliged to suspend ensign dekeyser for misbehaviour till your pleasure is known see the proceedings of the enquiring courts his character in many other respects has been infamous i have also been obliged to threaten in your name the new appointed officers with the same fate if they are not more diligent in recruiting the companies as each received his commission upon those terms captn mercer comes down for more money and to satisfy how the £ 0000 has been applied     the skipper of the vessels has embezzled some of the stores but for want of a particular invoice of them we cannot ascertain the loss he is kept in confinement until your honors pleasure is known i am c george washington    january      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria    january      sir when i was down the committee among other things resolved that the maryland and carolina companies should not be supported with our provisions this resolve i think met with your approbation upon which i wrote to colonel stephen desiring him to acquaint captain dagworthy thereof who paid slight regard to it saying it was in the kings garrison and all the troops had an equal right to draw provisions with us by his order as commanding officer and that we after it was put there had no power to remove it without his leave i should therefore be glad of your honors peremptory orders what to do in this case as i do not care to act without instructions lest it should appear to proceed from pique and resentment at having the command disputed this is one among the numberless inconveniences of having the fort in maryland captain dagworthy i dare venture to affirm is encouraged to say this by governor sharpe who we know has wrote to him to keep the command this captain dagworthy acquainted colonel stephen of himself as i have not yet heard how general shirley has answered your honors request i fear     the success especially as it is next to an impossibility as governor sharpe has been there to plead captain dagworthys cause by writing to make the general acquainted with the nature of the dispute the officers have drawn up a memorial to be presented to the general and that it may be properly strengthened they humbly beg your solicitation to have us as we have certain advices that it is in his power put upon the establishment this would at once put an end to contention which is the root of evil and destructive to the best of operations and turn all our movements into a free easy channel they have urged it in the warmest manner to me to appear personally before the general for that end which i would at this disagreeable season gladly do things being thus circumstanced if i had your permission which i more freely ask since i am determined to resign a commission which you were generously pleased to offer me and for which i shall always retain a grateful sense of the favor rather than submit to the command of a person who i think has not such superlative merit to balance the inequality of rank however he adheres to what he calls his right and in which i know he is supported by governor sharpe he says that he has no commission from the province of maryland but acts by virtue of that from the king that this was the condition of his engaging in the maryland service and when he was sent up there the  st of last october was ordered by governor sharpe and sir john st clair not to give up his right to my certain knowledge his rank was disputed before general     braddock who gave it in his favor and he accordingly took place of every captain upon the expedition except captain james mercer and captain rutherford whose commissions were older than his so that i should not by any means choose to act as your honor hinted in your last lest i should be called to an account myself  i have during my stay above  from the  st  of december to this disposed of all the men and officers that are not recruiting and can be spared from the fort in the best manner i can for the defence of the inhabitants and they will need no further orders till i could return and the recruiting officers are allowed till the first of march to repair to their rendezvous which leaves at present nothing to do at the fort but to train and discipline the men and prepare and salt the provisions for the better perfecting both these i have left full and clear directions besides in other respects i think my going to the northward might be of service as i should thereby so far as they thought proper to communicate be acquainted with the plan of operations especially the pennsylvanians so as to act as much as the nature of things would admit in concert if you think proper to comply with my request i should be glad of any letters as you think would enforce the petition to the general or any of the governors in my way there i am c     george washington   february      alexandria lieutenantcolonel stephen to lieutenantcolonel stephen alexandria   february      sir if you find that a good road by rosss mill can be so easily cut the sooner it is set about the better as the governor is still silent concerning what i represented about building a fort on pattersons creek i would have you desist at least for a while and erect such buildings as are absolutely necessary at fort cumberland and no more you may depend upon it i shall take proper notice of the late proceedings you speak of but for certain reasons am obliged to postpone it things not yet being rightly settled for punishing deserters according to their crimes you must go on in the old way of whipping stoutly if casks are still wanted there should be great care used to provide them in time looking upon our affairs at this critical juncture to be of such importance and having a personal acquaintance with general shirley which i thought might add some weight to the strength of our memorial i solicited leave which is obtained to visit him in person and accordingly set out in two days for boston having procured letters c from the governor which was the result of a council for the purpose called you may depend upon it i shall leave no stone unturned for this salutary end and i think if reason justice and every other equitable right can claim attention we deserve to be heard as i have taken the fatigue c of this tedious     journey upon myself which i never thought of until i had left winchester i hope you will conduct every thing in my absence for the interest and honor of the service and i must exhort you in the most earnest manner to strict discipline and due exercise of arms you may tell mr livingston from me that if the soldiers are not skilled in arms equal to what may reasonably be expected he most assuredly shall answer it at my return and i must ingenuously tell you that i also expect to find them expert at bushfighting you are to order that a particular account be taken of the provisions that are delivered to the maryland and carolina companies by the commissary the governor seems determined to make the officers comply with the terms of getting their commissions or forfeit them and approves of dekeysers suspension  and orders that he shall not be admitted into the camp he seems uneasy at what i own gives me much concern i e that gaming seems to be introduced into the camp i am ordered to discourage it and must desire that you will intimate the same as money may be wanted for paying the troops and other incidental charges order the paymaster down to alexandria where he may receive of mr kirkpatrick the sum requisite     i think of nothing else at present so with once more exhorting you to strict observation of discipline i conclude yours c george washington   february      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria   february      honble sir i can but return my very hearty thanks for your kind condescension in suffering me to wait upon general shirley as i am very well assured it was done with the intention to favor my suit there is as yet an unanswerable argument against our taking the field which i forgot to mention in my last that is the want of a train of artillery and what is full as necessary engineers to conduct the affair if we hope to approach fort duquesne by the advices which we have received hitherto from the northward the pennsylvanians are determined to act defensively for that purpose they have posted their new raised levies upon their frontiers at different passes and have received the additional strength and favor of a detachment or two from the regulars i have ordered besides the forts that are built and now building that a road which i had reconnoitred and which proves nearer and better to be immediately opened for the more easy transporation of stores c from winchester to fort cumberland so there is not the least fear of the soldiers being corrupted through idleness the commission for calling general courtsmartial appears to me to be imperfect   0 notwithstanding it is drawn by the attorneygeneral as it rather by the words appoints me or whomever it is directed to president of the said court than invests a power to call one as often as occasion shall require for which reason it is not in my power to hold a courtmartial without its being first ordered by you whereas the commission should empower to appoint a court of which he is to be president but as i hope there will be little occasion for any until i come back it may be deferred until then when that and other things i trust will be properly settled    i have always so far as it was in my power endeavoured to discourage gaming in the camp and always shall so long as i have the honor to preside there i have delivered the skipper to mr carlyle who proposes in order to save expense to send him round by water in the vessel that brought up the stores the evidences in this affair will be mr carlyle ensigns buckner and deane and one of the men now in the vessel i cannot help observing that your honor if you have not seen the clothing lately sent up has been imposed upon by the contractors for they are really unfit for use at least will soon be so i have nothing in particular to add but to assure your honour that i shall use my utmost diligence in the prosecution of my journey and pretensions and that i am c      notes on

the western governments of their coming in and firmly adhering to the interest of the english in opposition to the french  march    boston march   last friday came to this town from virginia the hon colonel washington  march    yesterday colonel george washington arrived here philadelphia from the northward george washington   april      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester   april      honble sir i arrived here yesterday and think it advisable to despatch an express notwithstanding i hear two or three are already sent down to inform you of the unhappy situation of affairs on this quarter the enemy have returned in greater numbers committed several murders not far from winchester and even are so daring as to attack our forts in open day as your honor may see by the enclosed letters and     papers many of the inhabitants are in a miserable situation by their losses and so apprehensive of danger that i believe unless a stop is put to the depredations of the indians the blue ridge will soon become our frontier i find it impossible to continue on to fort cumberland until a body of men can be raised in order to do which i have advised with lord fairfax and other officers of the militia who have ordered each captain to call a private muster and to read the exhortation enclosed for orders are no longer regarded in this county in hopes that this expedient may meet with the wishedfor success if it should i shall with such men as are ordered from fort cumberland to join these scour the woods and suspected places in all the mountains valleys c on this part of our frontiers and doubt not but i shall fall in with the indians and their more cruel associates i hope the present emergency of affairs assisted by such good news as the assembly may by this time have received from england and the commissioners will determine them to take vigorous measures for their own and countrys safety and no longer depend on an uncertain way of raising men for their own protection however absurd it may appear it is nevertheless certain that five hundred indians have it more in their power to annoy the inhabitants than ten times their number of regulars for besides the advantageous way they have of fighting in the woods their cunning and craft are not to be equalled neither their activity and indefatigable sufferings they     prowl about like wolves and like them do their mischief by stealth they depend upon their dexterity in hunting and upon the cattle of the inhabitants for provisions for which reason i own i do not think it unworthy the notice of the legislature to compel the inhabitants if a general war is likely to ensue and things to continue in this unhappy situation for any time to live in townships working at each others farms by turns and to drive their cattle into the thickly settled parts of the country were this done they could not be cut off by small parties and large ones could not subsist without provisions  it seemed to be the sentiment of the house of burgesses when i was down that a chain of forts should be erected upon our frontiers for the defence of the people this expedient in my opinion without an inconceivable number of men will never answer their expectations      i doubt not but your honor has had a particular account of major lewiss unsuccessful attempt to get to the shawanese town it was an expedition from which on account of the length of the march down i always had little expectation of and often expressed my uneasy apprehensions on that head but since they are returned with the indians that accompanied them i think it would be a very happy step to prevail upon the latter to proceed as far as fort cumberland it is in their power to be of infinite use to us and without indians we shall never be able to cope with those cruel foes to our country  i would therefore beg leave to recommend in a very earnest manner that your honor would send an express to them immediately for this desirable end i should have done it myself but was uncertain whether it might prove agreeable or not i also hope your honour will order major lewis to secure his guides as i understand he attributes all his misfortunes to their misconduct such offences as those should meet with adequate punishment else we may ever be misled by designing villains i am your honors c since writing the above mr pearis who commanded a party as per enclosed list is returned who relates that upon the north river he fell in with a     small body of indians which he engaged and after a dispute of half an hour put them to flight monsieur douville commander of the party was killed and scalped and his instructions found about him which i enclose we had one man killed and two wounded mr pearis sends the scalp by jenkins and i hope although it is not an indians they will meet with an adequate reward at least as the monsieurs is of much more consequence the whole party jointly claim the reward no person pretending solely to assume the merit  your honor may in some measure penetrate into the daring designs of the french by their instructions where orders are given to burn if possible our magazine at conococheague a place that is in the midst of a thickly settled country i have ordered the party there to be made as strong as time and our present circumstances will afford for fear they should attempt to execute the orders of dumas  i have also ordered up an officer     and twenty recruits to assist joseph edwards and the people on those waters  the people of this town are under dreadful apprehensions of an attack and all the roads between this and fort cumberland are much infested as i apprehend you will be obliged to draft men i hope care will be taken that none shall be chosen but active resolute men—men who are practised to arms and are marksmen i also hope that a good many more will be taken than what are requisite to complete our numbers to what the assembly design to establish as many of those we have got are really in a manner unfit for duty and were received more through necessity than choice and will very badly bear a reexamination another thing i would beg leave to recommend and that is that such men as are drafted should be only taken for a time  by which means we shall get better men and which will in all probability stay with us george washington   april      winchester governor morris to governor morris winchester   april      dear sir i had scarce reached williamsburg before an express was after me with news of the french and   0 indians advancing within our settlements and doing incredible mischief to the inhabitants which obligd me to postpone my business there and hurry to their assistance with all expedition when i came to this place i found everything in deep confusion and the poor distressed inhabitants under a general consternation i therefore collected such force as i coud immediately raise and sent them in such parties and to such places as twas judged most likely to meet with the enemy one of which under the command of mr pearis luckily fell in with a small body of them as they were surrounding a small fort on the no river of cacapehon whom they engaged and after half an hours close firing put to flight with the loss of their commander mons douville killed and three or four more mortally wounded the accident that has determined the fate of monsieur has i believe dispersd his party for i dont hear of any mischief done in this colony since tho we are not without numbers who are making hourly discoverys i have sent you a copy of the instructions that were found about this officer that you may see how bold and enterprising the enemy have grown how unconfind are the ambitious designs of the french and how much it will be in their power if the colonys continue in their fatal lethargy to give a final stab to liberty and property nothing i more sincerely wish than a union to the colonys in this time of eminent danger and that you may find your assembly in a temper of mind to act consistently with their preservation what maryland     has or will do i know not but this i am certain of that virginia will do everything that can be expected to promote the publick good i went to williamsburgh fully resolved to resign my commission but was diswaded from it at least for a time  if the hurry of business in which i know your honor is genly engaged will admit of an opportunity to murder a little time in writing to me i shoud receive the favour as a mark of that esteem which i coud wish to merit by shewing at all times when its in my power how much i am sir c p s a letter this instant arriving from williamsburg informs that our assembly have voted £ 0000 more and that their forces shd be increasd to  000 men a laudable example this and i hope not singular one george washington    april      winchester john robinson to john robinson winchester    april      dear sir when i wrote you last i was in high hopes of being by this time at the head of a large party scouring the allegany hills but the timidity of the inhabitants of this county is to be equalled by nothing but     their perverseness yesterday was the time appointed for all to meet who were inclined to join for this desirable end and only fifteen came some of whom refused to go but upon such terms as must have rendered their services burthensome to the country therefore i am again reduced to the necessity of waiting the arrival of a party from fort cumberland before i can leave this place  there has been no mischief done since i wrote you last  which i attribute in some measure to the frequent parties i have ordered out in pursuit of the enemy yesterday i received an account which made me suspect that the indians rendezvoused upon the back of the warm spring mountain i have therefore sent orders to an officer  who is out with a party of one hundred men to proceed thither with the best guides he can procure and search that mountain well which if the intelligence be true i hope he will render a good account of them nothing sir equals the pleasure i felt at hearing of the generous supplies the assembly have voted but to find that the men and money which they have given are properly disposed of and that the men are formed for the service of the country and not to make commissions to serve individuals i have sent     the governor a plan or scheme of which you have a copy to form the two thousand men into one regiment consisting of two battalions of ten companies each with five field officers each having a company and every company to consist of one captain two lieutenants one ensign four sergeants four corporals two drummers and eightyseven private men which will save the country the annual expense of five thousand and six pounds sixteen shillings and eight pence as you may see by the enclosed and we at the same time be better appointed and established more after the british custom than we now are or shall be if formed into two regiments or one regiment with only fifty men in a company  as instances of which i shall observe first were we formed into two regiments after our present appointment we must have one hundred and two commissioned and two hundred and twenty four noncommissioned officers besides staff officers but these indeed will be the same in two battalions as in two regiments whereas in the present scheme you have only eighty commissioned officers and two hundred noncommissioned the pay therefore of them together with the staffofficers and private men all amounts only to £       0 per annum whereas the same number of men in two regiments or in fifties according to our present establishment will be £          the difference therefore is as i before observed £ 00           which would go a great length either in clothing or defraying incident charges of the regiment another difference is that of giving the field officers companies which is practised in all parts of the world but this and here discontinued evidently to the disadvantage of the country as the field officers who have no companies are allowed in the same proportion as if they had and three captains are paid to do this duty this calculation is made for the two thousand men to include officers but if that is not the intention of the assembly the scheme still holds good or better in proportion and differs in this respect only that each company is to contain one hundred men instead of eightyseven and to have the addition of a sergeant or two to each i have made bold sir to offer my opinion freely and if it meets with the approbation of your house i should be glad if you would help it into execution otherwise as i am sensible the governor may be strongly importuned for commissions he may goodnaturedly grant them without considering how manifest an injury it will be to the country and service in general as i am convinced that no other method can be used to raise two thousand men but by drafting i hope to be excused when i again repeat how great care should be observed in choosing active marksmen the manifest inferiority of inactive persons unused to arms in this kind of service although equal in numbers to lively persons who have practised hunting is inconceivable the chance against     them is more than two to one another thing i hope will merit the consideration of the assembly and that is that they will put all such men as are raised for the expedition in actual pay and under the same discipline that ours are at present otherwise i am very well convinced their good intentions will prove abortive and all the drafts quit the service as soon or before they are brought into it i do not conceive it to be a hardship to put even drafts under martial law if they are only taken for a certain time which i could wish to be the case as i thereby hope for better men  i am c george washington    april      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    april      honble sir it gave me infinite concern to find in yours  by governor innes that any representations should inflame the assembly against the virginia regiment or give cause to suspect the morality and good behaviour of the officers how far any of the individuals may have deserved such invidious reflections i will not take upon me to determine but this i am certain     of and can call my conscience and what i suppose will still be a more demonstrable proof in the eyes of the world my orders to witness how much i have both by threats and persuasive means endeavoured to discountenance gaming drinking swearing and irregularities of every other kind while i have on the other hand practised every artifice to inspire a laudable emulation in the officers for the service of their country and to encourage the soldiers in the unerring exercise of their duty how far i have failed in this desirable end i cannot pretend to say but it is nevertheless a point which does in my opinion merit some scrutiny before it meets with a final condemnation yet i will not undertake to vouch for the conduct of many of the officers as i know there are some who have the seeds of idleness very strongly ingrafted in their natures and i also know that the unhappy difference about the command which has kept me from fort cumberland has consequently prevented me from enforcing the orders which i never failed to send however if i continue in the service i shall take care to act with a little more rigor than has hitherto been practised since i find it so necessary i wrote your honor in my last how unsuccessfully we attempted to raise the militia and that i was reduced to the necessity of waiting here the arrival of an escort from fort cumberland should this escort arrive before mr kirkpatrick does from williamsburgh whom i hourly expect i must yet wait a little longer he being left with all my accounts and papers to lay before the committee     and were i to go up without him it would put it out of my power to settle with the recruiting officers above in order that i might make a final settlement with the committee below the garrison at fort cumberland is barely manned the rest are out on parties yet the indians continue to hunt the roads and pick up straggling persons this your honor may see by the enclosed from captain john mercer who being out with a scouting party of one hundred men i have ordered to search the warmspring mountain where it is lately reported that the indians rendezvous the commission your honor has sent for holding courtsmartial is yet insufficient as it is copied i suppose too literally after governor inness who had no power to hold a general courtmartial or to try commissioned officers having none either to hold a court or in short any to try but this may be postponed until i come down which will be in a short time after i arrive at fort cumberland i am your honors c george washington winchester    april      governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    april      honble sir since writing my letter of yesterdays date the enclosed came to hand by which your honor will be informed of a very unlucky affair  i immediately consulted governor innes and such officers of my regiment as were at this place on the necessary steps to be taken they unanimously advised     that i should remain here with the fifty recruits that are in town for the defence of the place until the militia be raised that we may thereby be enabled to compose a formidable body and march out against the enemy this engagement happened within twenty miles of winchester and the sergeant who brought the letter assures me that they have reason to imagine that their numbers are greater than the letter informs  he says that there were many french amongst them and that the chief part of the whole were mounted on horseback so that there is a great probability that they may have a design upon this place i have sent an express to lord fairfax with a copy of starks letter and have desired in the most earnest manner that he will be expeditious in calling the militia but alas that is an unhappy dependence yet the only one we have at present i am your honors c george washington    april      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    april      honble sir this encloses several letters and the minutes of a council of war  which was held upon the receipt of     them your honor may see to what unhappy straits the distressed inhabitants as well as i am reduced i am too little acquainted sir with pathetic language to attempt a description of the peoples distresses though i have a generous soul sensible of wrongs and swelling for redress but what can i do if bleeding dying would glut their insatiate revenge i would be a willing offering to savage fury and die by inches to save a people i see their situation know their danger and participate their sufferings without having it in my power to give them further relief than uncertain promises in short i see inevitable destruction in so clear a light that unless vigorous measures are taken by the assembly and speedy assistance sent from below the poor inhabitants that are now in forts must unavoidably fall while the remainder of the country are flying before the barbarous foe in fine the melancholy situation of the people the little prospect of assistance the gross and scandalous abuses cast upon the officers in general which is reflecting upon me in particular for suffering misconducts of such extraordinary kinds and the distant prospects if any that i can see of gaining honor and reputation in the service are motives which cause me to lament the hour that gave me a commission and would induce me at any other time than this of imminent danger to resign without one hesitating moment a command which i never expect to reap either honor or benefit from but on the contrary have almost an absolute certainty of incurring displeasure below while the   0 murder of poor innocent babes and helpless families may be laid to my account here the supplicating tears of the women and moving petitions from the men melt me into such deadly sorrow that i solemnly declare if i know my own mind i could offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy provided that would contribute to the peoples ease lord fairfax has ordered men from the adjacent counties but when they will come or in what numbers i cannot pretend to determine if i may judge from the success we have met with here i have but little hopes as three days incessant endeavours have produced but twenty men i have too often urged my opinion for vigorous measures therefore i shall only add that besides the accounts you will receive in the letters we are told from all parts that the woods appear to be alive with indians who feast upon the fat of the land as we have not more than a barrel or two of powder at this place the rest being at fort cumberland i could wish your honor would send some up i have wrote to alexandria and fredericksburg desiring that two barrels may be sent from each place but whether there is any at either i know not i have sent orders to captain harrison to be diligent on the waters where he is posted and to use his utmost endeavours to protect the people and if possible to surprise the enemy at their sleepingplaces ashbys letter is a very extraordinary one  the design of the indians     was only in my opinion to intimidate him into a surrender for which reason i have wrote him word that if they do attack him he must defend that place to the last extremity and when he is bereft of hope then to lay a train to blow up the fort and retire by night to fort cumberland a small fort which we have at the mouth of pattersons creek containing an officer and thirty men guarding stores was attacked smartly by the french and indians they were as warmly received upon which they retired our men at present are dispersed into such small bodies guarding the people and public stores that we are not able to make or even form a body i am your honors c      george washington    april      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    april      honble sir not an hour nay scarcely a minute passes that does not produce fresh alarms and melancholy accounts so that i am distracted what to do nor is it possible for me to give the people the necessary assistance for their defence upon account of the small number of men we have or is likely to be here for some time the inhabitants are removing daily and in a short time will leave this county as desolate as hampshire where scarce a family lives three families were murdered the night before last at the distance of less than twelve miles from this place and every day we have accounts of such cruelties and barbarities as are shocking to human nature nor is it possible to conceive the situation and danger of this miserable country such numbers of french and indians are all around no road is safe to travel and here we know not the hour how soon we may be attacked but as it is not in my power to give your honor a full account of every thing i have sent captain peachey to wait upon you who can be more ample and satisfactory in every point that requires your honors notice i have written for the militia of fairfax prince william and culpeper and expect them here in a very few days but how they are to be supplied with ammunition and provision i am quite at a loss the distance of fort cumberland from us where these supplies are renders them useless     in a manner and puts us to the greatest straits and the inhabitants leaving their farms will make it impossible for the militia to subsist without provisions which are now very scarce and will be more so i should therefore be glad your honor would send arms ammunition and provisions up and give immediate orders for the irish beef at alexandria which cannot be had without your consent your honor spoke of sending some indians to our assistance in which no time should be lost nor means omitted to engage all the catawbas and cherokees that can possibly be gathered together and immediately despatched hither for without indians to oppose indians we may expect but small success and i should think it no bad scheme while the indians remain here in such numbers to have a detachment sent out with some friendly indians to make an attempt upon their towns—though this should be executed with all imaginable secrecy i hear the assembly are for augmenting the forces in pay to fifteen hundred which are far too few to defend the frontiers against so numerous an enemy but i have often wrote you my sentiments upon this and other subjects so shall not now enlarge i have also written to the speaker by captain peachey who will i imagine communicate to your honor what demands your immediate regard i wish your honor would resolve me whether the militia that are expected here must be supplied out of the public stocks of provisions laid in for the     soldiers or if they are to find themselves the want of due direction in matters of this nature causes great inconvenience give me leave to urge your honors speedy care of sending men and ammunition to our assistance else the consequence may prove very fatal in a little time i have been just now informed that numbers about the neighbourhood hold councils and cabals to very dishonorable purposes and unworthy the thoughts of a british subject despairing of assistance and protection from below as they foolishly conjecture they talk of capitulating and coming upon terms with the french and indians rather than lose their lives and fortunes through obstinacy my force at present is very weak and unable to take the necessary measures with those suspected but as soon as the militia arrive be assured i will do my utmost to detect and secure such pests of society if my information is not groundless which i should be pleased to find so i enclose your honor a copy of a council of war lately held here  and copies of some letters since my last to you one of which for colonel martin was just sent to me from fort hopewell on the south branch they have had an engagement there with the french and indians the particulars of which you will see by the enclosed captain waggener with a party of his men joined them next day and went in     pursuit of the enemy but could not come up with them the waters were so high that although captain waggener heard them engaged he could send them no assistance from these and other circumstances you may form but a faint idea of the wretched and unhappy situation of this country nor can it be conceived my extreme hurry confusion and anxiety must plead an excuse for incorrectness c i am your honors c george washington    april      winchester john robinson to john robinson winchester    april      dear sir yesterday i received yours by mr kirkpatrick and am sorry to hear the reflections upon the conduct of the officers i could wish that their names had been particularized that justice might be done to the innocent and guilty for it is extremely hard that the whole corps should suffer the most ungenteel reproaches for the inadvertence and misconduct of a few      the deplorable situation of this people is no more to be described than my anxiety and uneasiness for their relief and i see in so clear a light the inevitable destruction of this county without immediate assistance that i cannot look forward but with the most poignant sorrow you may expect by the time this comes to hand that without a considerable reinforcement frederick county will not be mistress of fifteen families they are now retreating to the securest parts in droves of fifties in short every thing has too melancholy an appearance for pen to communicate i have therefore sent an officer whose good sense and judicious observations will be a more effectual way of transmitting an account of the peoples distresses i wish the assembly had given two thousand men instead of fifteen hundred and that i had been acquainted with the dispositions they intended to make since i am ignorant of this i hope it will not be thought presuming when i offer my sentiments upon the subject we are sir first to consider that if a chain of forts is to be erected upon our frontiers it is done with a design to protect the people therefore if these forts are more than fifteen and eighteen miles or a days march asunder and garrisoned with less than eighty or an hundred men each the intention is     lost and for these reasons  st if they are at greater distances it is inconvenient for the soldiers to scout and allows the enemy to pass between without being easily discovered and when discovered so soon pursued and secondly if they are garrisoned with less than eighty or an hundred men the number will be too few to afford detachments then again our frontiers are so extensive that were the enemy to attack us on the one side before the troops on the other could get to their assistance they might overrun and destroy half the country and it is more than probable if they had a design upon the first they would make a feint upon the other then we are to consider what sums the building of twenty forts would cost and the removing stores and provisions to each and in the last place we are to consider where and when this expense is to end for if we do not endeavour to remove the cause we are liable to the same incursions seven years hence as now if the war continues and they are allowed to remain on ohio i shall next give the reasons which i think make for a defensive plan if the neighbouring colonies refuse us their assistance we have neither strength or abilities of ourselves to conduct an expedition or if we had and were the whole to join us i do not see to what purpose since we have neither a train of artillery artillerymen engineers c to execute any scheme beyond the mountains against a regular fortress again we have not that i can see either stores or provisions arms or ammunition wagons or     horses in any degree proportioned to the service and to undertake an affair where we are sure to fall through would be productive of the worst consequences and another defeat would entirely lose us the interest of every indian if then we cannot act offensively with a prospect of success we must be upon the defensive and that there is no way to protect the people or save ourselves but by a chain of forts is evidently certain i would beg leave in that case to propose that there should be a strong fort erected at this place for a general receptacle of all the stores c and a place of residence for the commanding officers to be garrisoned with one company for the security of the stores and to serve as escorts for all wagons that are going higher up because it is the most public and most convenient for intelligence of any in the country and the most convenient to the part that will ever be attacked by numbers it lying directly on the road to fort duquesne from whence and their indian allies who are still up higher we have the greatest reason to apprehend danger it also lies convenient to the inhabitants for raising the militia when occasion requires i have found by experience that being just within the inhabitants is absolutely necessary to give orders for the defence of the people and that fort cumberland is of no more use towards the defence of the country than fort george at hampton and know as little what is doing for the people so soon as they are alarmed immediately fly inwards and at     this time there is not an inhabitant living between here and fort cumberland except a few settlements upon the manor about a fort we built there and a few families at edwards on cacapehon with a guard of ours which makes this very town at present the outmost frontiers and though a place trifling in itself is yet of the utmost importance as it commands the communication from east to west as well as from north to south for at this place do almost all the roads center and secures the great roads of one half of our frontiers to the markets of the neighbouring colonies as well as to those on rappahannock and potomack at fort cumberland i would have one company garrisoned to secure the place to procure the earliest intelligence and to cover all detachments that may be sent towards the ohio which is all the use it can ever be of in the next place i would propose that a good fort should be erected between this and fort cumberland which shall be in a line with the chain of forts across the country and be garrisoned with two companies this i would advise because as i before observed if we are ever attacked by a large body it must be here as they have no other road to our frontiers either to transport men or necessaries these three forts that i have already spoken of will employ four companies which will be a tolerable body if the companies are large which they would be according to the plan i sent you and it would be a trifling expense to augment each company to one hundred privates which will make two   0 thousand exclusive of officers which were included in the scheme last sent after this is done i would post the remaining companies equidistant or at proper passes along our frontiers agreeable to the enclosed sketch and order communications to be opened between fort and fort and large detachments scouting to discover the tracks of the enemy and now sir one thing to add which requires the assemblys attention and that is what vale or upon what part of our frontiers these forts are to be built for i am to tell you that the great ridge or north mountain so called in evanss map to which i refer is now become our exterior bound there not being one inhabitant beyond that on all the potomack waters except a few families on the south branch and at joseph edwardss on cacapehon which i have already mentioned guarded by a party of ours so that it requires some consideration to determine whether we are to build near this to protect the present inhabitants or on the south branch or pattersons creek in the hopes of drawing back those who have forsaken their dwellings if we do not build there that country will ever want settlers and if we do there is so great a blank with such a series of mountains between that it will be next to impossible to guard the people effectually i could again wish that the assembly had given two thousand men exclusive of officers to be formed into two battalions of ten companies each with four field officers indeed fifteen hundred men are a greater     number than ever was in a regiment of only one battalion and they should be divided into two with four fieldofficers who should be posted so as to have the immediate care of a certain number of forts with orders to draw from one to another as occasion should require  i could add more on this subject but am so hurried that i am obliged to refer for further particulars to the bearer who will tell you that to carry on all these works a number of tools as well as many other necessaries will be absolutely wanting i have given my opinion with candor and submit     to correction with the greatest pleasure confusion and hurry must apologize for the incoherence and incorrectness hereof i am dear sir yours c george washington    april      winchester john robinson to john robinson winchester    april      dear sir in my last i omitted to observe one thing touching the defence of our frontiers by a chain of forts and it is this if the province of maryland makes no provision for its frontiers we shall have a long unguarded space quite open and defenceless from wills creek to the mouth of shanandoah where the enemy may have and have already given proof of free egress and regress in crossing potowmack plundering burning murdering and destroying all before them it is matter of moment and worthy the assemblys notice for we must secure that weak side if our neighbours are so indifferent as to disregard their own safety because of its connexion with ours in this case the number of forts will be increased to two or three more another material point to be regarded by the assembly and of very great importance to the inhabitants is the situation of these forts intended along the frontiers as i mentioned to you before that placing them on the former utmost frontier would be of small service to defend the present frontier settlements now so remote from the former for the enemy would still make incursions and carry off their booty with impunity without a considerable     number of men posted at these forts constantly patrolling in order to interrupt them and without such defence and protection the people will never be induced to return again to their plantations again if the forts are built upon the present exterior settlements the former lands will remain unsettled nor need we expect that the inhabitants will extend their improvements beyond these forts while such disturbances continue i would again urge the necessity of a large and strong fort at this town  for very cogent reasons as i hinted in my former it being the center of all the public roads and a place of the most importance on the frontiers i would advise its being large as it will be the sole refuge for the inhabitants upon any alarm where they may be received and protected until they can return with safety to their plantations and as it must be the magazine of stores to supply many other forts the country and soldiers with provisions ammunition c it ought of consequence to be large and pretty strong had such a place of defence been here it would have hindered some hundreds of families from moving further than this that are now lost to the country the women and children might have been secure while the men would have gone in a body against the savages whereas the number of men now left is so small that no assistance or defence can be made to any purpose winchester is now the farthest boundary of this county—no inhabitants beyond it and if     measures are not taken to maintain it we must retire below the blue ridge in a very short time let me therefore recommend to yours and the assemblys particular care that no time be lost in this salutary proposal for should this panic and fear continue not a soul will be left on this side the ridge and what now remain are collected in small forts out of which there is no prevailing on them to stir and every plantation deserted i have exerted every power for the protection and peace of this distressed unhappy people and used my utmost to persuade them to continue until assistance come though to little effect i have repeatedly urged lord fairfax to send for the militia of the adjacent counties and have sent myself several expresses to hurry them on if the assembly approve the scheme of erecting a fort here and at other places tools of all kinds will be wanting and must be sent up immediately that no time may be lost carpenters from below should likewise be engaged and every proper method for dispatching so desirable and so general a good as this defence for frederick c    george washington    april      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    april      sir i sent an express to fort cumberland on tuesday last who is just returned with the enclosed letters which i forward to prevent the trouble of extracting a part     in my letter to colonel stephen i did among other things inform him of the accusations laid to his charge and that he must expect to have the matter inquired into your honor will see what he says upon the subject desolation and murder still increase and no prospects of relief the blue ridge is now our frontier no men being left in this county except a few that keep close with a number of women and children in forts which they have erected for that purpose there are now no militia in this county when there were they could not be brought to action if the inhabitants of the adjacent counties pursue the same system of disobedience the whole must fall an inevitable sacrifice and there is room to fear they have caught the infection since i have sent besides divers letters to lord fairfax express after express to hurry them on and yet have no tidings of their march we have the greatest reason in life to believe that the number of the enemy is very considerable as they are spread all over this part of the country and that their success and the spoils with which they have enriched themselves dished up with a good deal of french policy will encourage the indians of distant nations to fall upon our inhabitants in greater numbers and if possible with greater rapidity they enjoy the sweets of a profitable war and will no doubt improve the success which ever must attend their arms without we have indians to oppose theirs i would therefore advise as i often have done that there should be neither trouble nor     expense omitted to bring the few who are still inclined into our service and that too with the greatest care and expedition a small number just to point out the wiles and tracks of the enemy is better than none for which reason i must earnestly recommend that those who accompanied major lewis should be immediately sent up and such of the catawbas as can be engaged in our interest if such another torrent as this has been or may be ere it is done should press upon our settlements there will not be a living creature left in frederick county and how soon fairfax and prince william may share its fate is easily conceived if we only consider a cruel and bloodthirsty enemy conquerors already possessed of the finest part of virginia plenteously filled with all kinds of provisions pursuing a people overcome with fear and consternation at the inhuman murders of these barbarous savages i have exerted every means that i could think of to quiet the minds of these unhappy people but for a man to have inclination and not power he may as well be without either for the assistance he can give the inhabitants of the county who are now in forts are greatly distressed for the want of ammunition and provision and are incessantly importuning me for both neither of which have i at this place to spare and if i had i should be much embarrassed how to act as i could not be safe in delivering either without your orders and to hear the cries of the hungry who have fled for refuge to these places with nothing more than they carry on their backs is exceedingly     moving therefore i hope your honor will give directions concerning this matter i have wrote to the assembly setting forth the great and absolute necessity there is of erecting a large and strong fort at this place to serve as a receptacle for all our stores c and a place of refuge for the women and children in times of danger was this necessary work completed the men would upon any alarm as they say themselves immediately lodge their families here and turn out against the enemy but without some such place of defence they must always fly in the manner they have in order to secure their wives and children this is the place generally fixed upon as it has a free and open communication with all the country from its centrical situation it also secures the communication with the neighbouring colonies as well as the trade to the rivers of rappahannock potomack c and though trifling in itself a place of the utmost importance to the country in general being contiguous to that part of our frontiers but alas this is the utmost frontier at present which ever must if any sustain the attack of numbers as it is the nearest to fort duquesne to which place we have opened a full communication it is also contiguous to their indian allies who are at present higher up the ohio than themselves it is also conveniently situated for procuring the earliest intelligence when the enemy is about and to obtain relief from the militia below in short it would be needless to urge all the cogent reasons that plead in its     behalf and shew how conveniently situated it is for the commanding officer to reside at but one i shall add which alone would be sufficient and that is what i have before observed viz the procuring intelligence this i now am truly sensible of from the earliest experience i have had since i came to this place since the first murders were committed by the indians i have never missed of receiving intelligence of their motions while colonel stephen has in a manner lived in total ignorance thereof the reason is very obvious for fort cumberland is detached so far without the inhabitants no person thinks of alarming them but immediately upon the first fright retires into the inhabitants and secondly it is absolutely necessary to have one large magazine to supply the different forts with stores c which magazine should be rather within the inhabitants for the greater security in receiving and delivering them out again and furnishing any reinforcements that may arrive from below with provision ammunition c which will always facilitate their march there should also be ammunition lodged here for supplying the country people when found useful your honor will observe some parts of colonel stephens letters as about reinforcements from the second division and the number of men c which were only finesses in case the letters had fallen into the enemys hands the letters that conveyed the true accounts were put into the pummel of the saddle as were mine to him     i have been formerly and am at present pretty full in offering my opinion and counsel upon matters which regard the public safety and interest these have been solely the object of all my thoughts words and actions and in order to avoid censure in every part of my conduct i make it a rule to obey the dictates of your honor the assembly and a good conscience i shall not hereafter trouble you further on these topics as i can add nothing to what i have said i am your honors c memms respectg the militia april and may       answer ye the governor that there are orders for drawing out all the ammunition c from fort cumberland know of the governor how they have apportioned the regiments whether into two battalions or not about mr fairfax and for blank commissions whether the field officers are allowed companies or not the great disadvantage the counties will labor under by appointing their draughts for so short a time before they are raised they must be discharged another disadvantage as we are to act upon the defensive is our delays in building forts it will be after midsummer before they can be completed and if the enemy are thick it cant be done at all without a great number of men to cover the workmen winchester on thursday the   th of may       divers expresses being first sent to the county lieutenants of fairfax prince   0 william and culpeper mr dalton at the head of    volunteers and    militia from fairfax came to town on same day i received an express from captain broadwater at the gap of the short hills informing me that himself and the captains ramsay minor and hamilton with about  00 men were at that place that he had received my despatches to hurry on the militia and desired to know what number should be sent i hereupon advised with captain dalton who told me that ten men from each of those companies were the complement intended by the commanding officer in fairfax i thereupon ordered that number to be immediately detached sunday morning they accordingly came under captain james hamilton as did captain russel with    volunteers from williamss gap this day i received another express from captain broadwater setting forth that he had just received one from colonel carlyle ordering him to remain at that place till he heard from me and that he was scarce of provision and could not buy i also about the same time received an express from colonel carlyle desiring me to order up such part of the said militia as i thought necessary upon which i sent to captain broadwater for a detachment of    more and ordered the others to be dismissed may  d the aforesaid detachment of    arrived which made in the whole including volunteers but of these    returned     men may  d  00 of the aforesaid militia under the captains minor and hamilton were ordered to march for the branch the rest to join a scouting party of the regiment that was ordered to search back country may  th the parties marched captain hamilton was ordered to consult pearsal  the kirkendal for the proper place to fix his company at below the troughs and captain minor to advise with colonel vanmeter  captain waggener for fixing above see their instructions in my orderly book dated may  th     captain dalton with his volunteers and the rest of the militia marched with the scouting party of the regiment he had orders to post the militia after he had finished their tour of duty and returned to conogochieg at any place where the generality of the people in those parts but more especially captain swearing would choose as the most convenient for protecting the whole and to return to this place with his own company of volunteers see his orders of the  th may this day  0 of minors and hamiltons men deserted may  th the prince william detachment consisting of   officers and     private men arrived here and about an hour or two after them came colonel ewel may  th lieutenant colonel peyton came to town and captain joseph murdock with   officers and  0 men from king george sent up by colonel champe a detachment of  0 privates left the county the rest deserted on their march may  th the county lieut of prince william colonel henry lee arrived this day we began to experience in a surprising degree the superlative insolence of the prince william detachment who made use of every means to treat not only the private soldiers but the officers of the virginia regiment ill and upon one of them being seized and ordered to the guard house for abusing in the most insolent manner the officer     one of their officers called for a number of men to rescue him and pulled down the house swore the officers of the virginia regiment were all scoundrels and that he could drive the whole corps before him the fright that he received from one of them and his acknowledgments next morning sufficiently allowed for his imprudence in the evening of this day captain dalton with not only his volunteers but captain russel and his with the remaining few of the militia came to town upon enquiring the reason of this i was answered that captain russel and his volunteers had got tired and must needs go     home and that the militia which were only    were too small to post at any pass as i had ordered as indeed they were may  th captains dalton russel with the volunteers and militia set out on their return homewards so that there only remains of the fairfax militia those who went on to the branch   oclock this evening i had an express from colonel slaughter informing me that he was then as far as perkinss with about  00 of the culpeper militia upon which i ordered him to remain there as the town had more already in it than they could lodge and many quarrelsome fellows amongst them he also informed me that they had not above  0 firelocks in the whole may  0th he came into town and informed me that beside himself there were—officers whereof—were field officers and—private men and that by a late supply his number of arms were now about  0 colonel bailor with   field officers   captains   subalterns   corporals    sergeants and   0 privates arrived at this place from caroline county may   th colonel spotswood from spotsylvania with   field officers   captains  0 subalterns and   0 private men arrived here and encamped in colonel woods meadow colonel henry fitzhugh with   captains   subalterns   clark   sergeants and  0  privates also came to town as did   of the king george deserters the prince william militia were ordered to march tomorrow under the command of a captain and   subalterns to strengthen the forts on pattersons creek with a superintendent and  0 men and to build another at the mouth of little cocapenon  but colonel henry peyton who had received a special commission from his honour the governor insisted upon going out to command them i expostulated with him on the absurdity of it and represented the unnecessary charge it     would run the country to employing of supernumerary officers but nothing would put aside his intentions he said his only motive in going was to serve his country and that he expected no reward or gratuity for his trouble and that unless he went he was sure the men would desert present colonel lee captain mercer and mr kirkpatrick may   th was the first time i could get a return of the number of carpenters that were among the militia in the evening about   oclock lieutenantcolonel peyton with the prince william detachment marched consisting of himself   captain   subalterns     privates as per return see his orders at large in my orderly book this day also the king george militia had orders to march to mendenhalls fort to protect the inhabitants under those mountains the officers and soldiers of the militia begin to discover great uneasiness at their stay and want much to return thinking they have performed a sufficient tour of duty by marching to winchester may   th an express came from colonel peyton informing that a sergeant and    men deserted last night from him at pariss fort and desiring reinforcement i was obliged to countermand the orders to the king george militia and to send them to join him with orders to remain in ashbys fort and they accordingly marched    in number under lieutenant nugent the rest were sick  deserted and this night   out of the    also marched off many complaints from the officers of militia about the insufficiency of the allowance of provisions for the men tho they have one pound of meat and the same quantity of flour per day which is the same that the soldiers have obliged me to order the commissary to deliver the officers allowance to the private men in order to appease their clamours this i did to prevent increasing the allowance and setting bad examples but this proving insufficient also i was obliged to order the allowance to be increased to  ¼ of flour and as much flesh per day     may   th the orange militia under colonel talliaferro consisting of   field officers   captains   subalterns and  00 private men came to town as did colonel barrat with   0 men from louisa in the evening of this day i summoned all the field officers to meet that we might advise and consult on proper expedients to be taken with the militia see a copy of the proceedings in my orderly book in consequence of these resolves and advise from colonel martin  mr commissary walker knowing the situation of our frontiers i ordered the commanding officers of each militia to furnish the following number of men which was proportioned equally among those that were here and appointed them to remain as below fd off capt l e i men  at mendenhals fort lieut thomo with         from orange county at the mouth of sleepy creek      0    0 from caroline at the mouth of little cocp            0 p william at ashbys fort           from k george also at ashbys fort           from spo at cocks fort             from fairfax at pearsals             from fairfax at harnesss fort     0    0 stafford at waggeners uppr f      0    0 culpeper at enochss     0      louisa at winchester to work on the fort and to be ready in cases of emergency    exclusive of the above and taken from all the sevl countys fairfax and prince william have furnished a larger number of men than the other countys because they arrived with those numbers and were ordered on to assist and relieve the inhabitants on the branch and  it would have run the country to considerable additional expense to relieve them now and to no very great purpose as we soon expected to receive the draughts may   th the council being finished the aforesaid number of men were ordered to be draughted and the remainder     to receive provision to carry them back and to be discharged the said several draughts were ordered to get ready to march in the morning to their respective posts may   th the commanding officers of each militia culpeper excepted reported that several of their men had deserted upon which i sent out to see if they could be taken the commissary also reported that he had been trying and could not procure a wagon to transport the necessary stock of provisions and ammunition with them and was therefore obliged to postpone their march one day longer by this time i had engaged  0 carpenters from the militia to work at  d extra pay on the fort and also had their own officers to overlook and manage them may   th some time last night an express from the branch arrived with letters from ashbys fort and pearsalls fort informing that a considerable body of indians were about again and had taken a prisoner upon this all the militia of louisa and stafford save   of the first and   of the latter deserted and the caroline detachment being reduced to  0 rank  file the spotsylvania to    and the orange being lessened also was obliged to add the   louisa men to the carpenters till the return of their officers who i immediately sent in pursuit of them the   stafford men to those of spotsylvania  to alter the disposition that was first made to the one following viz—  fd off c l e i pm  at mendenhals 0     0    0 fm caroline at ashbys fort      0    fm sp  k g at pearsals            0 fm p w at kirkendals            fm fx at harnesss fort     0      orange at wagr upper fort            culpr to be advd by c wr  cl van             fx the reason for this disposition to guard the inhabitants that still remained to secure their grain and stock to help     in with their harvest and to be contiguous to the people and to each other that they might unite occasionally and go in quest of the enemy besides the militia officers that were sent after their deserters i ordered out one from the regiment with a party of   or  0 men mounted to go in pursuit of them our strength being so much reduced by the number of deserters that had gone off that upon the return of ashbys  i immediately dispatched an express to colonels barrat talliaferro and slaughter who were the last that had left this place ordering them to return with their men in the evening the colonels barrat  talliaferro returned without any men informed me that many of them had taken different roads homewards and that those who were with colonel talliaferro upon hearing that they were ordered back charged their pieces and continued their march towards their county in defiance of the officers may   th last night mr bullet the officer who i had sent out returned with    of the deserters who to avoid punishment enlisted in the virginia regiment   th the express returned from colonel slaughter who also informed that his men were dispersed but if they could be gathered again he would return on thursday may  0th about   oclock this night an express came to me from colonel slaughter who informed me that he had met at the place appointed for the rendezvous of his militia but that only   or   appeared desired to know if he should farther rendezvous to collect he believed it might be done so soon as they recovered a little from the fatigue of their march i wrote him by this express  desired him as i had heard nothing of the enemy since to postpone bringing up any men till they were drafted which i recommended to him to be done with the greatest expedition also if it would not be contrary to the governors orders to him to march his men so soon as drafted to this place as it would save much time and expence     george washington   may      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester   may      honble sir i received your two letters of the   d and   th ultimo i have sent down an indian scalp which was taken off at the place where captain mercer had his engagement he was found thrust under some rocks and stones piled up against them they have reason to believe there were more killed from the quantity of blood found on the ground where the indians fired from and from other discoveries of their attempts to make more graves but a hard shower of rain prevented their making a farther search we have some reason to believe the indians are returned to fort duquesne as some scouts from fort cumberland saw their tracks that way and many corroborating accounts affirm that the roads over the allegany mountains are as much beaten as they were last year by general braddocks army from these and other circumstances we may judge their numbers were considerable whether they are gone for the season or only to bring in a larger party i am at a loss to determine for which reason and from the scarcity of provisions on this side fort cumberland i must beg leave humbly to offer it to your honors superior judgment if it would not be advisable to stop all the militia that are ordered from the ten counties save about five or six hundred from the adjacent ones which will serve to cover our frontiers on this quarter     which is the only part that ever will or can be much exposed until the regiment is completed by drafts and until they can erect fortresses if the country intend a chain of forts for their defence drafts if they are judiciously chosen will be of infinitely more service and much less expense to the country and can be immediately put to their posts i am convinced that if your honor has a mind to stop any part of the militia you will have full time notwithstanding they are ordered to rendezvous at this place on the  0th instant i never knew any yet to appear in ten days after they were expected and i am also apprehensive that having so many of the militia out will be the means of retarding the drafts which above all things i wish to see though i have often troubled you on this head i must again beg leave to desire your particular instructions and information of what is to be done as being in a state of uncertainty without knowing the plan of operations or what scheme to go upon reduces me to the greatest straits and leaves me to guess at every thing orders that are absolutely necessary to be despatched to the officers one day appear the next as necessary to be contradicted so that i really cannot tell how to act for the good of the service or satisfaction of any individual was the regiment complete and things put on a proper footing the whole would go on smoothly and regularly which is now rendered impossible so much am i kept in the dark that i do not know whether to prepare for the offensive or defensive and what might be     absolutely necessary in the one would be quite useless in the other great inconveniences arise from our being so dispersed through the country the men cannot be regularly paid or supplied if every company had its proper post assigned pay might be sent to them and necessaries always provided in due season we could also have the same advantages were we collected in one place but there are so many detachments out one officer may command men of every company of the regiment and if necessaries are sent them he is removed from his command and those things cannot be stopped out of their pay so by this method the country loses money the men are badly supplied and always discontented i find the act of assembly against mutiny and desertion quite insufficient except in those two particular crimes there is no notice nor can a courtmartial be held by virtue of this act against any officer or soldier who is charged with cowardice holding correspondence with the enemy quitting or sleeping upon a post nay many other crimes which are provided against in the articles of war i think at this time it would be for the good of the service to make an act to enforce the articles of war in general except two or three particular ones such as impressing wagons c they are in force in our mother country they think them the best calculated for keeping soldiers under discipline and none of them would prove burthensome or inconvenient either to the public or any individual and i cannot nor   0 i imagine few others can assign any reason why we should pretend to quit that which by long experience has been found the best to introduce one quite insufficient there are now in town about one hundred and fifty of the fairfax militia three hundred are expected from prince william with the soldiers and militia now here i intend to go out and scour the woods hereabouts for three or four days until the others arrive i want very much to go to fort cumberland to regulate affairs there but fear i cannot spare time as my presence will be very necessary here clothes for the men are very much wanted there are none in store and some men who have been enlisted these two months to whom we could give nothing but a blanket shoes and shirt are justly dissatisfied at having two pence per day stopped from them  provision here is scarce and the commissary much wanted to lay in more i have been and still am obliged to do this duty as well as most others which i would take upon me rather than let any thing be wanting for the good of the country which i could do i enclose your honor the sentence of a general     courtmartial which was held here upon a sergeant for running away with his party  they have i think very justly adjudged him to suffer death which sentence i hope you will approve of as there never was a fitter object to make an example of being the second time he has been guilty of the same crime nor a better time as the newly drafted recruits for the regiment may be here by that time to see it executed and it will be a good warning to them    george washington    may      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    may      sir the method i shall use to inform your honour of the proceedings of the militia is to enclose a transcript of my journal that relates to that affair and to send a copy of a council of war held here by the fieldofficers of these counties you were pleased to order to our assistance  these i hope will be sufficient to discover the springs that actuated my conduct     the spirit of desertion was so remarkable in the militia that it had a surprising effect upon the regiment and encouraged many of the soldiers to desert but as i never had failed in sending officers on different roads upon the first reports so neither did i neglect it now and luckily caught two who being brought to trial were both convicted as your honor will see by the courts proceedings james thomas one of them was among the first of my followers and always behaved himself with the greatest sobriety honesty and diligence so far as i have ever seen or heard and i imagine if he did not lose the money as he says in his defence he might be prevailed upon to spend a part in liquor and then was afraid to meet his officer with the rest the other criminal henry campbell is a most atrocious criminal and richly deserves an ignominious death for a former as well as the present offence he was once a sergeant and entrusted with some goods from alexandria part of which he embezzled and because it could not be absolutely proved was only reduced after that in december last he deserted and carried several men with him and upon the most solemn promises of good behaviour was pardoned but for this only reason—we had no power to hold general courts martial and now he was instrumental in carrying off seven others two only of whom were taken for these reasons i hope your honor will think him as worthy an example against desertion as lewis against cowardice whose execution i have delayed until the arrival of the     drafts these examples and proper encouragement for good behaviour will i hope bring the soldiers under proper discipline i found it absolutely impossible to go to fort cumberland at this time without letting matters of greater importance suffer in my absence here such a multiplicity of different kinds of business am i at present engaged in governor innes is gone up who i hope will assist with his advice in settling things to rights if any irregularities have been practised contrary to the custom of the army but i cannot find by any inquiries that i have been able to make that there have been i have ordered a sufficiency of officers to be left at fort cumberland and the rest to repair to this place in order to proceed to fredericksburg agreeably to your honors commands and as soon as the gentlemen associators arrive here i shall take that place in my way to williamsburg to settle my accounts and receive more money which is already scarce with me i am heartily glad your honor has fixed upon those gentlemen to point out the place for erecting of forts but am sorry to find their motions so slow  the summer season will be so far advanced     that if we meet with opposition in conducting the work the difficulties and delays that must attend the execution cannot be described it gave me infinite concern to find the assembly had levied their troops until december only by the time they shall have entered into the service they will claim a discharge to get the least smattering of the duty they cannot and we find by experience that our poor and ragged soldiers would kill the most likely militia in five days marching so little are the latter acquainted with fatigue men would almost as soon have entered the service for seventeen months as for seven and in that time i am convinced we could have enlisted them all upon our own terms as it is some perhaps may be got pray does your honor approve that they should one of those would be of more worth than two of the others     your honor in a letter of the—ult approved the scheme i sent down for forming the regiment into two battalions of twenty companies giving the fieldofficers each one but never gave any directions concerning the appointment nor do i think there can be any plan judiciously concerted until we know what number of forts are to be built upon our frontiers as the number of our companies must in a great measure depend upon the divisions of the regiment as the case now stands there are several vacancies in the regiment and i have but one blank commission though if i had i should not think it prudent to fill up more until matters are a little better regulated at this place i have begun the fort according to your orders and found as little of the matter as i know myself that the work would not be conducted if i was away which was one among many reasons that detained me here  i have also ordered captain stewart who commands at conococheague to fortify that place as well as he can with the tools he can procure and shall endeavour in all things so far as i am capable to act for the best mr dick who is just returned from the northward says there are orders for drawing out all the ammunition and other stores that belong to the train at fort cumberland and to send them immediately round to new york i have thought it expedient to give your honor the earliest advice that you may order accordingly for should this be done it will     leave that place entirely defenceless and stop the source that can supply us otherwise i have given colonel stephen previous notice of it and have desired he will work on the conductor of the train in whose care it is left to have the forts of ashby cockes c plentifully furnished before such an order arrives  i am c george washington    june      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    june      honble sir i doubt not but your honor will be as much surprised as i have been concerned and vexed at my stay here when i left williamsburg i did it with a design to proceed with the utmost expedition to fort cumberland in order thereto i arrived at fredericksburg to dinner the day after i left your honor at one oclock and gave the officer posted at that place a list of such tools as were wanted to build the chain of forts and ordered they might be sent by a wagon pressed for that purpose immediately to winchester     to which place i repaired to get every thing in readiness and wait their coming to escort them to fort cumberland after i had been here two or three days i received a letter enclosing a list of the tools from the officer who informed me that he had according to order despatched them in a wagon hired for that purpose for which wagon i have been waiting with the greatest impatience and uneasiness imaginable how to account for this delay i am quite at a loss as i am certain they were sent unless the wagoner has lost his horses or run off with the wagon and contents i thought it needless to proceed without them as nothing can be done for want of tools i have sent two or three expresses to hurry them on and shall make no delay when they arrive i intend to take the advice of a council of war when i arrive at fort cumberland about the line on which these forts are to be erected c and shall visit all the ground that i conveniently can and direct the building it is a work that must be conducted tedious for these reasons vizt the scarcity of tools smallness of our numbers and want of conductors the strength of our forces will not admit of many divisions because in that case each party may probably be demolished we can therefore only attempt with such men as can be drawn out of the garrisons already established to build fort after fort and not by attempting too many at a time thereby run the risk of having the whole demolished to go on in the manner above mentioned must be extremely tedious unless     your honor will be pleased to put the militia that are upon our southern frontiers under the command of captain hog and order them to begin on the mayo river and proceed in their building until they meet our parties who will advance to the southward i can point out no other method at present to expedite this necessary work if your honor approve this scheme and will let me know by express i shall despatch another to captain hog to inform him thereof and shall enclose him such a plan as the whole will be directed by your honors orders to the militia and indeed to the inhabitants of those parts to assist with their advice in fixing upon the places and with their labor in forwarding the work must be absolutely necessary your honor never gave me a decisive answer to a question i asked about giving the fieldofficers companies for which reason i have presumed to repeat it again because there are two companies now vacant by the death of captain john mercer and the resignation of captain savage and should either be given to the fieldofficers or oldest lieutenants there is no advantage can possibly arise to the fieldofficers by having companies but trouble there certainly will as they are allowed i suppose the same pay now as though they had the only reason that urges me to repeat it is because i look upon this to be a singular instance to the contrary and running the country to the additional expense of three supernumerary captains two hundred and fortysix drafts are the total     number brought in out of which number several have deserted three were discharged being quite unfit for service and indeed several more ought to be if men were not so scarce and there remain now in confinement six quakers who will neither bear arms work receive provisions or pay or do any thing that tends in any respect to selfdefence i should be glad of your honors directions how to proceed with them  i cannot yet return to your honor the names of the volunteers that will be appointed to the vacancies but as soon as i arrive at fort cumberland shall acquaint you according to request governor sharpe is building a fort on potomac river about fifteen miles above conococheague which may be of great service towards the protection of our people on that side it is thought the fort will cost the province of maryland near thirty thousand pounds before it is finished  i am c    0 george washington    july      fort cumberland captain waggener to captain waggener fort cumberland    july      sir the companies of the virginia regiment are completed to an equal number except yours which through mistake of the returns is not but as i expect more men every minute you shall be immediately completed as you have on command with you several men of other companies the officers have received orders to apply to you for them and you must deliver them up i desire you will send james campbell the drummer by the first escort that comes to winchester from the great confidence i repose in your diligence i have appointed you to a command on which much depends and i doubt not you will see the work carried on with expedition and i must particularly recommend it to you to keep up a strict command both over officers and men as you will be answerable for any delays or neglect which may happen for want of due discipline and i would not wish your good nature should occasion you to overlook a fault in an officer who may be your best friend     as i am informed by the people who met me at pearsalls that there is a fort now kept by the country people about twenty miles from your upper one in a proper place if upon arriving there you find it will do with a little alteration or amendment i would have you take it in behalf of the country leave men to garrison it and so proceed on to the next place when you arrive there you may get all the timbers ready and by that time i shall send you a plan of the kind of forts i would have you build the people whom i have conversed with on the subject seem to think there will be no difficulty in providing provisions for the men i would have you provide for these in the same manner you have hitherto done for your own company and whatever orders you give on that account shall be duly honored i would have you from time to time transmit me an account of all occurrences the governor has ordered the militia to be discharged as soon as harvest is over since they are so unwilling to continue until december and should you march on with all the men to building these forts it might give the inhabitants uneasiness and raise complaints to be left unguarded i would therefore desire you to leave small parties at proper places to keep them quiet and easy in case you see occasion for it if you have occasion for more ammunition you must send to fort cumberland for what you want     instructions for captain peter hog sir as the assembly has voted a chain of forts to be built on the frontiers the governor has ordered out the militia of augusta to assist you in erecting them and it was determined in a council of war held at fort cumberland agreeable to the governors orders that you should have the care of constructing them and that you should receive directions to build at or about  0 or  0 miles distance as the situation of the country requires or ground will permit and to have particular regard to the body of inhabitants to be defended and the passes most frequented by the enemy and that capt hog begin to build observing the above considerations to the southward of fort dinwiddie extending the line towards mayo river as directed by the assembly you are therefore as soon as possible to proceed to augusta courthouse and consult with the comanding officers and others of that county and fall upon the most expeditious methods to raise the militia with which and your own company except about  0 private which you are to leave under the command of lt bullet at fort dinwiddie and set immediately upon that duty taking care to observe the orders herewith sent you by his honor the governor and to draft the best work men to take with you if you are apprehensive that the enemy will annoy you and endeavour to obstruct your erecting these forts you are first to proceed to the place which shall be judged most convenient for the defence of the inhabitants and erect your first fort there—if not—proceed as first directed you are while upon this work to keep out constant covering parties and above all things guard against a surprise i have sent you herewith a plan of the kind of forts you are to build which you must follow exactly the men drafted from your company for this command will receive double pay for every day they work which you are to be exact in taking account of tis the same that s allowed the soldiers here who work and the militia will receive  d extra for every day they work both soldiers and militia here are contented with this allowance     i hope your own company with the addition of the militia will be of sufficient force to conduct this work but lest dividing your men may subject your seperated partys to the insult of the enemy i would have you keep in a body and build fort after fort leaving garrisons in them from    to  0 men under command of a sub or trusty sergeant as the difficulty of getting tools in these parts is not easily to be conceived i would advise you to pursue the same methods in augusta that i have done here vizt to get of the inhabitants giving receipts for the quantity and sorts of each and paying for the use also the damage and loss if any is sustained but to buy would be best if this you can do take particular care of the whole you receive given under my hand at winchester   st of july       george washington    july      winchester captain stewart to captain stewart winchester    july      sir herewith i enclose you two plans of the kind of forts that are intended to be built—one of the groundwork the other of the houses and all conveniences—with such directions that i think it     impossible for you to err if you will attend thereto enclosed you will also receive a list of such tools as i have been able to procure with which and such as you may get of the inhabitants by borrowing hiring and buying you must be content these must be put in the hands of the best tradesmen and most laborious workmen who will receive sixpence extra ordinary pay for every day they work an account whereof must be kept exactly by yourself and officers the men that remain after the workers are draughted must act as covering parties to prevent surprizes against which you must carefully guard it is impossible for me to fix upon the identical piece of ground to erect this fort on therefore i shall confine you to the most convenient spot between the mouth of sleepy creek and barracks which you will make choice of with the approbation of your officers there is a hill which overlooks boyles field and extensive country round that may be made infinitely strong and will answer the purpose well if it is not too high and inaccessible this you must examine into i have too great an opinion of your good sense and discretion to think you need any admonition to induce you to a diligent discharge of your duty you see our situation know our danger and bear witness of the peoples sufferings which are sufficient excitements to a generous mind as many things will occur that i cannot possibly direct in let the interest of the service and your own prudence assisted by the advice of the officers under your command be your direction this instant i received yours of yesterdays date and am extremely     sorry that the indians have visited us at this critical juncture of harvesting especially as it will prevent your proceedings in the operations ordered as your conduct must be guided by the movements and numbers of the enemy i will not take upon me to order positively at this distance but recommend it to you to consult your officers on all occasions and act by their advice if you can learn from good intelligence that their numbers are great and motions designed for virginia endeavor to give the inhabitants notice that they may lodge their women and children and assist against the enemy if you find they are only flying parties of the indians i would advise the settlers by no means to neglect their harvest as their whole support depends upon it and your assistance to get it in i must order above all things that you will send out small parties or rather single persons as spies every day up and down the river for a number of miles to see if they can make any discovery of the enemys crossing i have sent you two barrels of powder and four boxes of ball as to cartridge paper i neither have nor can get any upon no terms you must get horns and pouches if you send over the neighborhood for them transmit me constant accounts of the enemy if they continue in your neighborhood george washington   august      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester   august      honble sir giving the necessary orders and directions about the chain of forts to be built on the frontiers has     kept me so closely employed that i could not write fully to your honor until this but i have got that trouble now pretty well off my hands as i have despatched orders plans and tools to all the officers appointed to that duty by the enclosed proceedings of a council held at fort cumberland you will see our determination there and where it is necessary to erect the forts although we have not kept strictly to the act of assembly i hope it will be overlooked as i am sensible that this will be the best chain that can possibly be erected for the defence of the people and that the assembly aimed at that but being unacquainted with the situation of the country had fallen into an error  agreeable to this council the chain is ordered to be built     your honor by the enclosed rolls of the companies may see their present establishment and i send you a copy of their former one agreeable to your orders together with the number of drafts from each county delivered at fredericksburg but many of them deserted on their march to this place and after their arrival here so we are short of that number now what remain are divided among the companies to make them equal captains hog and waggeners rolls i cannot yet send as they are not come to hand the two vacant companies captain savages and the late john mercers as i had your honors approbation for the field officers having companies are disposed of to colonel stephen and myself the next vacancy the major must fill i am very glad your honor intends to order the drafts now to be made to be sent here prince william fairfax and culpeper are more convenient to this place than fredericksburg then their being ordered here saves a ninety miles march i make no doubt that your honor has ere this     heard of the defeat of lieutenant rutherford  of the rangers escorting an express to me at fort cumberland and of the dastardly behaviour of the militia who ran off without one half of them having discharged their pieces altho they were apprised of the ambuscade by one of the flanking partys before the indians fired upon them and ran back to ashbys fort contrary to orders persuasions threats c they are all ordered in as soon as the people have secured their harvest those of king george and caroline counties are already here the rest i expect shortly through the passive behaviour of their officers they have been very refractory captain stewarts troop has for these twelve months past and must still continue to do duty on foot their pay is very great i should be glad of your honors orders in regard to them whether they are to be continued i think with the number of men we have there is but a poor prospect of finishing our forts in time and a much worse of defending our frontiers properly and i would be glad some expedient could be fallen upon to augment it there is an act of parliament to allow all servants to enlist and the owners to be paid a reasonable allowance for them if we had this privilege we could soon complete the regiment and i doubt not but his majesty would order them to be paid for if we enlisted as soon as for the regulars nay should he     not the ten pounds fine through the country would go a considerable way towards it  and this we may depend upon if we have not this liberty granted us the servants will all run off to the regular officers who are recruiting about us and that would be to weaken our colony much when it could receive no immediate benefit from it but only be benefited in a general way for my part i see no other expedient   00 now your honor sees plainly the effect the act of assembly in regard to the drafts has had and how little our strength has been augmented by that scheme and in three or four months we shall not be the better for them then they are to be discharged i am confident if we had authority to enlist servants the regiment would have been complete ere this and with little trouble for many have offered and many have been discharged after enlisting mr kirkpatrick will deliver your honor a list of the preferments in my regiment with the dates of the officers commissions there are five or six more still waiting lieutenant stark has followed fraziers example upon the like occasion being appointed to captain hogs company i have sent lieutenant bullet to relieve lieutenant  0  mcneill whose seniority entitles him to captain lieutenancy and he has my promise when a vacancy happens to have his commission antedated and to take his proper rank in the regiment as i take him to be a very diligent good officer and as he was overlooked in the promotions this indulgence has been promised him i could wish we were clear of fort cumberland it takes a great part of our small force to garrison it and i see no service that it is to our colony for since the indians have drove the inhabitants so low down they do not hesitate to follow them as far as conococheague and this place there have been several families murdered within two miles of the mouth of conococheague on the maryland side this week and fort cumberland is now so much out of the way that they seldom hear of those things within a month after they are done our men want many necessaries until the arrival of their regimentals which cannot be had without sending to philadelphia and the great loss we shall suffer by sending them our paper money has prevented my purchasing these things until the men are almost naked i should be glad your honor would send me a letter of credit to mr allen or some person there or gold or bills for we cannot afford to put up with the loss of sending paper money which i am credibly informed may be bought up in philadelphia for fifteen per cent their currency so that the least we would lose by that traffic would be ten per cent we are in great want of drums here and none can  0  be bought we now have many young drummers learning here so i must beg you will please to order some immediately from williamsburg to us for we cannot do without them the rangers are still paid out of the money in my hands i never received but one hundred pounds from lord fairfax or colonel george captain gist has some accompts against the country for necessary services i doubt not your honor will consider the justice of them and assist the poor man in the affair as he is put to great inconveniences for want of the money has been obliged to advance his own as far as it would go and people to whom he owes balances upon that account are daily threatening him with suits captain mcneill writes me that out of the three companies of rangers on the frontiers of augusta which ought to be one hundred and twenty men there are not thirty i hope your honor will have that affair inquired into i am to be summoned against one napp for making counterfeit paper money here i desire your directions whether i must appear or not it may perhaps be at a time when i am much wanted here i could by no means bring the quakers to any terms they chose rather to be whipped to death than bear arms or lend us any assistance whatever upon the fort or any thing of selfdefence some of their friends have been security for their appearance when they are called for and i have released them from the guardhouse until i receive further  0  orders from your honour which they have agreed to apply for  i am informed there has been application made to your honor for the discharge of some of the militia who enlisted here as the case may have been represented to your honor in a wrong light by prejudiced persons i shall give you a true state of it from my own knowledge after the militia were fixed on to march to their different posts it was common for twenty or more to desert of a night in consequence of which i despatched the militia officers with what remained and some of my own officers in pursuit of these deserters who apprehended seventeen or eighteen of them and brought them to town the militia had then marched to send these men after them i was certain would not answer to avoid that was the cause of their desertion and i could not spare men to send an escort with them to their different parties and if i had let them pass unpunished it would have occasioned all the militia at work on the fort to desert so i thought it most advisable to punish them to deter the rest and prevent a second fault in them and accordingly ordered them twenty lashes each and then intended to have set them to work on the fort when they had marched from the guardhouse where several had enlisted before any punishment was ordered them some of the officers applied for  0  money and said all the militia would enlist which i gave them and at the same time a charge to use no unfair means or threats which they engaged in order to prevent any i sent out captain mercer to acquaint them with my charge to the officers and to tell them that if any unfair means had been made use of to engage them to take the money to declare it and they should be allowed to return it and further be acquainted with the indulgence allowed them by act of parliament and that they had a right to return the money within twenty four hours if they should repent of what they had done in that time they all declared their willingness to enlist said no unfair means had been made use of and that it was better to enlist at once than to be subject to be draughted every week when they were soldiers they knew what to depend upon which they could not before as their being draughted at an unreasonable time might ruin them they used the same arguments again to captain mercer when he read the articles of war to them and he again repeated what he had told them before in the morning as i have been assured by several of the officers then present the men have always appeared well satisfied and never have made the least complaint nor will not i am sensible if they are not persuaded to it by the people below they have now been enlisted upwards of ten weeks and are very good men upon the whole i dare say your honor will judge the men to be fairly enlisted and that they are no ways entitled to a discharge which will be applied for by some gentlemen  0  below but i shall take your honors directions on that point in obedience to your honors commands to incorporate the rangers into the regiment i gave furloughs to the captains who both desired it knowing they would oppose any measures to enlist the men and then sent some of my officers to use their influence to engage the men their success i have not yet heard of but should be glad to know if you approve of this method or will direct any other as rangers under the present establishment they are of no use or benefit to the country this i believe your honor as well as the country have long since been convinced of i have supplied the nottoway indians with some necessaries and have allowed them to take their arms with them but they have received no pay and say they were promised a bit  per day captain tom has promised to go to the tusks with a speech and wampum which i have given them he says they have an hundred fightingmen to spare they would be a great assistance to us if they could be engaged to come   0  besides the men on the rolls sent your honor there are about one hundred drafts not disposed of in the different companies which are at work on the fort and garrisoning some of the country forts i have just received your honors letter of the   th ultimo if mr timberlake will enter as a volunteer in the regiment and wait as others have done his turn i shall be glad to serve him but i cannot pretend to put him over young gentlemen who have served some months at their own expense waiting preferment without orders from your honor as such things have caused the greatest discontent and confusion in the regiment already i observe your honors proposal to lord loudoun  of carrying on an expedition against the ohio i have always thought it the best and only method to put a stop to the incursions of the enemy as they would then be obliged to stay at home to defend their own possessions but we are quite unprepared for such an undertaking if it is fixed upon now is the time for buying up provisions and laying them in at the most convenient place the pennsylvania butchers are buying quantities of beef here which should be put a stop to if we are to march towards the ohio if we are still to remain on the defensive and garrison the chain of forts provisions must be laid in at  0  each of them and i much fear if we march from the frontiers all the inhabitants will quit their plantations your honors sentiments and orders on this head will be very agreeable to me and shall be punctually complied with by the latest advices from augusta it is thought that these outrages were committed by the cherokees there have been no accounts of any thing since the first attempt but still i think it would not be improper to keep the militia on the frontiers to oppose a second and if your honor should think it proper to order them to assist on the forts to be built in augusta i think they could not better employ their time george washington   august      winchester john robinson to john robinson winchester   august      dear sir i hope you will not be surprized at my sudden demands for money nor at the uncommon length of this epistle the five thousand pounds last received went chiefly in paying arrears which were due the soldiers for two months before discharging sundry accompts for necessaries for the regiment with many other things as will appear per accompts and the disappointments i have so often met with in settling my accompts with the gentlemen of the committee and laying sundry matters before them for their approbation oblige me to be more particular and prolix in this letter  0  i flatter myself that my accompts will appear in so clear a light that there can arise no scruple in the settlement and that they may be adjusted in as full and distinct a manner by mr kirkpatrick as if i were present myself there were some objections made to a few trifling articles before none of which i believe exceeded twenty shillings for want of receipts in this i own i was a little remiss sometimes paying horse hire for a day or two and such like incidental charges for the use of the public without thinking it very material to draw receipts indeed i have often made these payments at times when i had no opportunity of being thus particular but i believe the whole amount of these does not exceed five pounds and since that time i have not parted with a sixpence without the paymaster i have sent down to evince any doubt that may arise in his accompts i believe they are strictly just tho a little broken and irregular representing our disjointed service in a true state this was impossible to be avoided tho if you will consider sir the disagreeable services we have been engaged in the extent of ground and people to be defended and the division of our force in recruiting marching countermarching and garrisoning of forts guarding stores c which rendered them so extremely difficult to pay as well as to supply with such necessaries and conveniences as to render the service tolerably supportable mr boyd was obliged to pay the men when and where he could meet with them without adhering to that regular form which ought to be observed the commissary  0  stands charged with £— which i have not had an opportunity to settle upon my return from fort cumberland a few days ago i found him retired at his own house indisposed but received a letter informing that the money was just expended this i have no doubt of knowing the demands he has had on account of provisions for the drafts and militia occasioned by our whole stock being laid in at fort cumberland by the governors orders which renders it useless to all the forces on this side wagonage of all the flour and stores from conococheague to secure them here purchasing of tools c for erecting the public works ordered by act of assembly c all accompts that appeared extravagant or not clear in other respects or that i conceived i had no power to settle i have referred them to the gentlemen of the committee among these is finnies for money advanced the soldiers while he was recruiting this accompt may be and doubtless is just yet as it happened at a time when i had no concern with the forces it is not to be expected i can have any knowledge of the matter therefore unless it was to meet with your or the concurrence of the committee i should not care to pay it moses quales who gives mr finnie an order upon you for five pounds eighteen shillings was among those who escaped from the overthrow of general braddock but was slain in captain mercers defeat captain mckenzies accompt for the hire of a vessel to transport his recruits to alexandria i did not care to allow without directions tho several officers   0 have petitioned in the same manner because they were to receive two pistoles a man and eight pence per day subsistence as a full allowance tho too small until they came to the rendezvous the article of rugs he should be allowed doctor shepherd also prefers an account for attending and administering to sundry recruits while they lay at alexandria as also dr halkerson for those at fredericksburg these accompts you will please to have examined and deliver your statements thereon ensign fleming has at my request acted as surgeon to captain hogs company he encloses an accompt pray order what you think sufficient for his trouble lieutenant bakers accompt is also among these for twentythree pounds nine shillings and eleven pence—expences in going for and bringing the nottaway indians in this i must crave directions i could not get a more particular accompt than the one now sent he being on command captain gist also has at divers times entreated me in the most interesting manner to intercede in his behalf that he may get the balance of his accompt his distresses calling aloud for all the assistance that all these sums can contribute i do not know really who to apply to for this purpose or whose right it is to pay the accompt but it is certainly wrong not to pay him at all if a hearty zeal for the interest of this colony many losses in serving it and true distress can recommend him to any favor he certainly merits indulgence when he offers his accompts to the governor his honor bids him go to the committee     and the gentlemen of the committee think the governor should pay it so that the poor man suffers greatly and would be glad to know his doom at once as it has been so long depending many applications have been made to me for the ferriages of the forces in passing shenandoah capecapon the south branch c i should be glad to know whether they are to be paid and at what rates i could heartily wish the governor and committee would resolve me whether fort cumberland is to be garrisoned with any of the virginia forces or not it lies in a most defenceless posture and i do not care to be at expence in erecting new or repairing the old works until i am satisfied in this point this place at present contains all our provisions and valuable stores and is not capable of an hours defence if the enemy were to bring only one single halfpounder against it which they might do with great ease on horseback besides it lies so remote now from this as well as the neighbouring inhabitants and at the same time is not a whit more convenient than cockes fort on pattersons creek to the enemy which is twenty five miles nigher this way that it requires as much force to keep the communication open to it as a fort at the meadows would do and employs   0 men who are a dead charge to the country as they can be of no other use than just to protect and guard the stores which might as well be lodged at coxs  indeed better for these reasons it would then be more contiguous to this to the inhabitants     and to the enemy if we should ever carry an expedition over the mountains by opening a road the way the indians have blazed  a strong garrison there would not only protect the stores but also the few remaining inhabitants on the branch  and at the same time waylay and annoy the enemy as they pass and repass the mountains whereas those at fort cumberland lying out in a corner quite remote from the inhabitants to where the indians always repair to do their murders can have no intelligence of any thing that is doing but remain in total ignorance of all transactions when i was down i applied to the governor for his particular and positive directions in this affair the following is an exact copy of his answer—fort cumberland is a kings fort and built chiefly at the charge of the colony therefore properly under our direction until a governor is appointed  now whether i am to understand this ay or no to the plain simple question asked vizt—is the fort to be continued or removed—i know not but in all important matters i am directed in this ambiguous and uncertain way      great and inconceivable difficulties arise in the execution of my commands as well as infinite loss and disrepute to the service by my not having power to pay for deserters i would therefore humbly recommend it to the consideration of the committee whether it would not be more for the interest of the country i am sure it would be of the service were i allowed to pay these demands rather than have them levied in the public claims many of our deserters are apprehended in maryland and some in pennsylvania and for the sake of a reward are brought hither but when they are to receive certificates only that they are entitled to two hundred pounds of tobacco and those certificates are to be given in to a court of claims there to lie perhaps till they are quite forgot gives so much dissatisfaction that many i believe rather than apprehend one would aid fifty to escape and this too among our own people by this means the country loses numbers of men consequently the sums of money which each man costs besides many incident charges such as horse hire expenses in sending after and advertising them another thing which i should be glad to know and that is whether the act of assembly prohibits the whole forces or only the drafts from marching out of virginia and whether it is contrary to law even to take the drafts out provided it is done with their own will if we cannot take any of the forces out of the colony the disadvantages the country may labor under are not to be described for the enemy in that     case may commit the most unheardof cruelties and by stepping across the potomac evade the pursuit and mock our best endeavors to scourge them the inconveniences that arise from paying the soldiers in large bills are not to be conceived we are obliged afterwards to give the pay of two or three soldiers to one man he ten to one drinks games or pays it away by which means the parties are all dissatisfied and perpetually complaining for want of their pay it also prevents them from laying out their pay for absolute necessaries and obliges them many times to drink it out for they put it into the tavernkeepers hands who will give no change unless they consent to take the greatest part in liquor in short for five shillings cash you may at any time purchase a months pay from the soldiers in such contempt do they hold the currency besides small bills if the thing is practicable i should be extremely glad to receive some part of the money in spanish and portugal gold and silver there are many things wanted for the use of the regiment which cannot be had here and may be obtained at philadelphia but their undervaluing of our money has prevented my sending thither when i went to fort cumberland i left fifty pounds with capt peachy to pay the workmen once a week as i had usually done which money with some of his own he was robbed of and the most diligent search has not been successful in getting the least intelligence of it i should be glad to know whether i am to suffer this loss or whether i may with propriety charge it to the country     at the repeated instances of the soldiers i must pay so much regard to their representations as to transmit their complaints they think it extremely hard as it is indeed sir that they who perhaps do more duty and undergo more fatigue and hardship from the nature of the service and situation of the country than any troops upon the continent should be allowed the least pay and smallest encouragements in other respects the carolinians received british pay the marylanders i believe do the same pennsylvania is exorbitant in rewarding their soldiers  the jerseys and new yorkers i do not remember what it is they give but the new england governments give more than a shilling per day our money besides an allowance of rum peas tobacco ginger vinegar c c our soldiers complain that their pay is insufficient even to furnish shoes shirts stockings c which their officers in order to keep them fit for duty oblige them to provide this they say deprives them of the means of purchasing any of the conveniences or necessaries of life and obliges them to drag through a disagreeable service in the most disagreeable manner that their pay will not afford more than enough if that to keep them in clothes i should be convinced of for these reasons if experience had not taught me the british soldiers are allowed eight pence sterling per day with many necessaries that ours are not and can buy what is requisite upon the cheapest terms and lie one half the year in camp or garrison when they cannot consume     the fifth part of what ours do in continual marches over mountains rocks rivers c who are computed to receive only—per day then sir is it possible that our men who receive a fourth less have two pence per day stoppages for their regimental clothing and all other stoppages made that british soldiers have and are obliged by being in continual action to lay in triple the quantity of ammunition and clothes and at double the price should be able to clear quarters it is not to be done and this is the reason why the men have always been so naked and bare of clothes and i dare say you will be candid enough to allow that there are few men who would choose to have their lives exposed without some view or hope of a reward to the incessant insults of a merciless enemy another thing there is which gives them great uneasiness and that is seeing no regular provision made for the maimed and wounded they acknowledge the generosity of the assembly and have the highest veneration for that respectable house they look with gratitude on the care that has been taken of their brother soldiers but say this is only an act of will and another assembly may be much less liberal we have no certainty that this generosity may continue consequently can have nothing in view but the most gloomy prospects and no encouragement to be bold and active and the probable effects of which are wounds which no sooner happen and they unfit for service than they are discharged and turned upon an uncharitable world to beg steal or starve in short     they have a true sense of all that can happen and do not think slightly of the fatigues they encounter in scouring these mountains with their provisions on their backs lying out and watching for the enemy with no other covering or conveniency to shelter them from the inclemency of the weather than trees and rocks the old soldiers are affected and complain of their hardships and little encouragement in piteous terms and they give these as reasons for so much desertion the money that is given in paying for deserters expresses horsehire losses and abuse of horses would go a great length toward advancing their pay which i hope would contribute not a little to remove the cause of this expense i would not have it here understood tho that i mean to recommend any thing extraordinary no i would give them british pay and entitle them to the same privileges during their stay in the service and as a reward or compliment for their toil rather than a matter of right were the country to give them one suit of regimental clothes a year without receiving the two pence stoppage it would be a full allowance and give great content and satisfaction all they want they say is to be entitled to the privileges and immunities of soldiers of which they are well informed by some who have been a number of years in the army then they should think it no hardship to be subject to the punishments and fatigues were this done and an order given by the committee empowering me to provide for them according to the rules and customs of the army     i then should know what i was about and i could do it without hesitation or fear and am convinced to the satisfaction and interest of the country as the case now stands we are upon such odd establishment under such uncertain regulations and subject to so much inconvenience that i am wandering in a wilderness of difficulties and am ignorant of the ways to extricate myself and to steer for the satisfaction of the country the soldiers or myself having no certain rules for the direction of my conduct i am afraid to turn to this hand or to that lest it should be censured if such an order as i before spoke of was to issue from your board i would then immediately provide upon the best terms a quantity of all kinds of ammunition clothes c for the use of the regiment and deliver them out to each company as their wants required taking care to deduct the value of all such things from their pay by this means the soldiers would be always provided and fit for duty and do it cheerfully and the country sustains no other loss than advancing and lying out of the money for a few months to lay in those stores as this money is always restored by the soldiers again  i have hitherto been afraid to advance any sums of money for this salutary purpose and always bought at extravagant prices and have been obliged to send to different parts ere they could be had which has also contributed to the cause of their nakedness the officers are almost as uneasy and dispirited as the men doing every part of duty with languor and     indifference when they are ordered to provide themselves with suitable necessaries they complain of an uncertain establishment and the probability of being disbanded and so things rendered useless so that i really most heartily wish for a change the surgeon has entreated me to mention his case which i shall do by enclosing his letters he has behaved extremely well and discharged his duty in every capacity since he came to the regiment he has long discovered an inclination to quit the service the encouragement being so small and i believe would have done it had not the officers to show their regard and willingness to detain him subscribed each one days pay in every month this as they are likely to be so much dispersed and can receive no benefit from him they intend to withdraw he says and therefore begs me to solicit the gentlemen of the committee in his behalf otherwise he shall be obliged to seek some other method of getting his livelihood if it is thought necessary to establish an hospital i believe there can scarcely be a doubt but that this is the place and then i hope he will be appointed director with advanced pay whether or not i could really wish his pay or perquisites was increased for the reasons he gives i beg sir with very great earnestness that the gentlemen of the committee will communicate their sentiments fully upon all these several matters and approve or disapprove of every thing therein i only wait to know their intention and then act in strict conformity thereto   0 since writing the preceding pages i find on examining mr boyds accompts that he has unadvisably paid mr finnie what arrears were due quales but having already appealed for approbation of the committee in this and other accompts which i had no distinct knowledge of or concern in i yet submit to your determination and mr finnie must abide by your judgment and refund if found reasonable if the committee find my account satisfactory and distinct as i have no doubt of it it would be a great obligation if they would make a final settlement to that date and begin a new account as it would be the means of keeping matters more clear and intelligible hereafter for long accounts and references to doubtful points instead of gaining any light are but darkened and confused by procrastination the late regulation of our companies will occasion more regularity in the paymasters account and be more satisfactory in every shape for the future besides the gentlemen of the committee will find little trouble or difficulty in overhauling short accounts kept in a regular method plain and perspicuous which is the very life of business i would again entreat your regard to my request for these and many other reasons george washington   august      winchester captain waggener to captain waggener winchester   august      sir i have so many places and people to defend so great calls from every quarter for men and so little     prospects for getting any that i find it impossible to comply with the act of assembly and opinion of the council of war in building the chain of forts on the frontiers you must therefore notwithstanding all the orders which have heretofore been given immediately despatch captain bell with his whole company to captain coxs fort where he is to remain himself with twenty men taking command of said fort and escorting all expresses wagons c to and from fort cumberland as far as ashbys and pearsalls the rest of his men he is to divide into two equal parts one of which with his ensign is to march to and be stationed at kirkendalls for the protection of the people there the other party with a trusty sergeant is to march to and put themselves under the direction of the officer commanding at ashbys in order to strengthen that garrison and enable them to afford escorts with the greater safety your own and the two remaining companies you are to dispose of in the most eligible manner for the protection of the inhabitants above the trough and i could most earnestly wish that you would if the thing is practicable erect a fort in that settlement twenty miles above your upper fort that the people in those parts may be sheltered from the enemy and that we may so far as is possible shew our willingness to comply with the laws of our country that direct this chain i wrote you yesterday desiring that all the captains would be punctual in making me exact weekly returns to be signed by themselves and officers of     the state and strength of their companies and must repeat those orders as i am fully resolved to suspend the first captain or commander of a company that neglects in sending me them or that is careless in correcting or returning them exact tho they may vary but a man all the militia that are not already marched must be immediately ordered down to call at this place to lodge their arms george washington   august      winchester colonel stephen to colonel stephen winchester   august      sir yours of the  0th ultimo and  st inst i have just received i am sorry to hear you even mention recalling capt mckenzie from his post it must have been an extraordinary occasion that would have reconciled me to that proceeding which would have left coxs pearsalls and kirkendalls forts quite defenceless to strengthen a garrison which was only intended to defend the stores and might be protected by  00 against musketry as well as by more and all the men we have could not save it against any thing else i have in order to strengthen the several garrisons that maintain the communications with fort cumberland ordered captain bell to march to coxs and there remain with twenty men while the rest of his company is equally divided one part to strengthen ashbys the other to protect the inhabitants at kirkendalls by this means mckenzies company will be kept entire at     pearsalls and enable him to furnish the stronger escorts i hope you will mention that matter to rutherford which we talked of at fort cumberland about recruiting the rangers the militia now can neither serve nor disserve us for they are by the governors directions all called in the views of the enemy are designed against the lower inhabitants they have laid maryland and pennsylvania waste as low as carlisle the inhabitants of which place we are told are flying with the utmost consternation they have made an attempt on the virginia side killed one and captivated another on the conococheague road four miles hitherwards but retreated back for how long a time god knows i communicated the contents of yours to the doctor concerning medicines and he will send them up so soon as procured at present he has none of them having occasion to write to captain waggener i have ordered him to despatch the men belonging to your garrison immediately yesterday i wrote you and desired that all the captains would be punctual in making me weekly returns signed by themselves and officers signifying the state and strength of their companies and shall here repeat these orders because i am fully resolved to suspend the first captain or commander of a company that fails in this point or that is negligent and incorrect in making them out tho they may err but in one man by my returns of the regiment including drafts scouts and rangers i can only make     men while mr boyd exclusive of captain hogs company has     issued pay for  0 0 what am i or what are the governor and committee before whom all these widely different returns must be laid for examination to think of them sure the least they can say is that it is unhappy for the country to have officers so little acquainted with the management of their companies as to make returns to me for     men only and others to the paymaster for  0 0 you desire to have a map sent you of the lakes c i have none but evanss which you have also nor have i heard a syllable from major lewis altho mr jones is now here from augusta nor any thing about an engagement on the lakes george washington    august      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    august      honble sir the return of the express that came with la forces escape for which accident i am extremely concerned and fear its productions if he is not retaken affords me an opportunity to inform your honor of some occurrences which have happened since my last  repeated complaints and applications from all quarters for men but more especially from the garrisons which secure the communication with fort cumberland     a place very useless in itself and expensive to the country containing an hundred and fifty men solely employed in guarding the stores which could be better defended at any other place obliged me to order a company from captain waggeners detachment for none else could spare a man to reinforce and enable those garrisons to send escorts with wagons and expresses going to and returning from cumberland fort this reduced captain waggeners command to a number insufficient to disperse parties among the settlers and retain a strength to conduct the buildings therefore the grand point then turned on this whether he was to neglect the inhabitants and build the forts or neglect the forts and mind the inhabitants his council were of the latter opinion unanimously and sent to know my sentiments which i own corresponded with theirs for these reasons first i look upon it that the protection of the inhabitants was the motive for ordering these forts and to lose them while we are at work is perverting the intention secondly we have built some and altered other forts as far south on the potomac waters as any settlers have been molested and there only remains one body of inhabitants at a place called the upper tract which needs a guard upon these waters and thither i have ordered a party after this if i am not misinformed there is nothing but a continued series of mountains uninhabited until we get over on james river waters not far from that fort which takes its name from your honor down which to mayo river     captain hog by your honors orders is to have the direction of if i have done amiss in not adhering to the letter of the law i hope your honor will intimate the same and give directions how i am to proceed there have been two or three men killed and scalped at different places since my last though every precaution has been taken to prevent it the fatiguing service low pay and great hardships in which our men have been engaged cause notwithstanding the greatest care and vigilance to the contrary great and scandalous desertions yesterday i received an account from captain stewart of sixteen men deserting in a party frequently two or three went off before as they have done from this place we never fail to pursue and use all possible means to apprehend them but seldom with success as they are generally aided and assisted off by the inhabitants there are now two parties in pursuit of these fellows who have made towards the northward to enlist with the recruiting officers in pennsylvania c i fear without a stop can be put to it we shall lose numbers of our men  a report prevailed in town yesterday     said to come from a man who had it from a person who was at governor morriss treaty with the indians and heard them say that a large body composed of different nations and headed by some french intended to attack fort cumberland this fall reports of this kind often take rise without good foundation yet as this is an affair of great importance the slightest intelligence ought not to be discountenanced especially when we consider that our provision and what is still more valuable all our ammunition and stores are lodged in that defenceless place the consequence of a successful enterprise of this sort and the absolute impossibility considering the weakness of the place badness of situation and division of our force of preventing its falling are without previous notice motives sufficient to apprehend the worst therefore notwithstanding i enlarged on this subject in a former letter think it my duty to hint this again and to get directions how i am to proceed it is true i give no credit to this intelligence because i flatter myself such important information as this would be communicated in the most distinct and expeditious manner by governor morris yet as i before said it being an expedition they cannot fail of succeeding in what should deter them from attempting it we have certain advice that two of our deserters have reached fort duquesne and were heard to speak in high terms before they went off but this was not known till after they were gone of the reward that would be got for communicating the weakness     of the works and garrison at fort cumberland all the militia are returned save thirty from culpeper who stay willingly with captain fields as a general meeting of all the persons concerned in the estate of my deceased brother  is appointed to be held at alexandria about the middle of september next for making a final settlement of all his affairs and as i am very deeply interested not only as an executor and heir to part of his estate but also in a very important dispute subsisting between colonel lee  who married the widow and my brothers and self concerning advice  in the will which brings the whole personal estate in question—i say as this is a matter of very great moment to me i hope your honor will readily consent to my attending this meeting provided no disadvantage is likely to arise during my absence in which case i shall not offer to quit my command if war is to be declared at this place i should be glad if your honor would direct the manner i know there is ceremony required but the order i am ignorant of  i am c address to his command you see gentlemen soldiers that it hath pleased our most gracious sovereign to declare war in form against     the french king and for divers good causes but more particularly for their ambitious usurpations and encroachments on his american dominions to pronounce all the said french kings subjects and vassals to be enemies to his crown and dignity and hath willed and required all his subjects and people and in a more especial manner commanded his captaingeneral of his forces his governors and all other his commanders and officers to do and execute all acts of hostility in the prosecution of this just and honorable war and though our utmost endeavors can contribute but little to the advancement of his majestys honor and the interest of his governments yet let us show our willing obedience to the best of kings and by a strict attachment to his royal commands demonstrate the love and loyalty we bear to his sacred person let us by rules of unerring bravery strive to merit his royal favor and a better establishment as reward for our services  george washington    august      winchester thomas fairfax to lord fairfax  winchester    august      my lord it is with infinite concern i see the distresses of the people and hear their complaints without being able to afford them relief i have so often troubled   0 your honor for aid from the militia that i am almost ashamed to repeat my demands nor should mention them again did i not think it absolutely necessary at this time to save the most valuable and flourishing part of this county from immediate desertion and how soon the remainder part as well as the adjacent counties may share the same fate is too obvious to reason and to your lordships good sense for me to demonstrate the whole settlement of conococheague in maryland is fled and there now remain only two families from thence to fredericktown which is several miles below the blue ridge by which means we are quite exposed and have no better security on that side than the potomac river for many miles below the shenandoah and how great security that is to us may easily be discerned when we consider with what facility the enemy have passed and repassed it already that the maryland settlements are all abandoned is certainly fact as i have had the accounts transmitted to me by several     hands and confirmed yesterday by henry brinker who left monocacy the day before and also affirms that three hundred and fifty wagons had passed that place to avoid the enemy within the space of three days i thought it expedient to communicate the above in order to inform your lordship of the reasons for asking succours for these unhappy people and how absolutely necessary it is to use without delay such vigorous measures as will save that settlement from total desolation we see my lord the absurdity of the peoples arguments and the consequences of leaving one county nay one part of the county or to go still farther a single company that is more exposed than another to defend itself and the parts in danger when hampshire was invaded and called on frederick for assistance the people of the latter refused their aid answering let them defend themselves as we shall do if they come to us now the enemy have forced through that county and begin to infest this those a little removed from danger are equally infatuated and will be i fear until all in turn fall a sacrifice to an insulting and merciless enemy these observations may be improperly offered to your lordship but they occur in so refulgent a light to me that i could not resist the impulse of dictating them i am so weakhanded here that i could not without stagnating the public works spare a man to these peoples assistance yet i look upon the retaining of them to be so essential to the wellbeing of the county in general that i have ordered all the men that can possibly be spared to march thitherwards     and they accordingly set out tomorrow morning to remain there until your lordship can relieve them that they may return to these works which in my opinion are of no little importance to the safety of the county if we should be attacked by numbers as we have reason to apprehend i hope your lordship will exert your authority in raising men for this salutary end and that you will think it advisable to make every company furnish their quota this will redress the complaints of the people below who say they cannot leave their families to the mercy of the enemy while they are scouring the woods this is the reason given by some why catons party consists but of ten men while others say it proceeds from dislike to the man i acquainted his honor the governor with your lordships order for raising fifty men for this service who approved thereof and has been pleased to direct me to continue them there so long as i see cause i cannot conclude without again mentioning how agreeable it would be if your lordship would order a party immediately to these parts that i may withdraw my men to their duty at this place i am my lord c george washington   september      winchester colonel stephen to colonel stephen winchester   september      sir yours of the   th    d august i received mr boyd is just returned from williamsburg settling his accompts and getting a supply of cash he will be with you to pay you off     i am in hopes our men for the future will be better satisfied as the committee have allowed them  d per day and their clothes without any stoppages or deductions the governor expects this encouragement will engage the rangers to enlist i wrote him about fort cumberland being put down but he says as it is a kings fort he cannot venture to abandon it without further orders from a higher power he says lord loudoun will be at williamsburg about the  0th november and then the affair may be properly represented to him he has however sent me orders to draw from thence a sufficient quantity of stores for this and the other forts and i have accordingly sent wagons to be loaded with ammunition c for that purpose the governor informs me too that he just received an express from major lewis acquainting him that he might expect   0 cherokees to be at this place in a fortnight that the catawba king was gone to south carolina and had engaged to send  0 warriors to our assistance on his return from thence this will be a considerable help to us as we shall be able to carry the war into their own country and use them in the same manner they have us for    months past he adds that the catawbas and cherokees are very firmly attached to our interest and will still furnish us with more assistance when the fort in that country is completed t is already in great forwardness i have wrote to captain waggener of this and ordered him to keep up a correspondence with yours and the other forts that you may hear from     each other every week i beg you will see to have every man at the fort supplied with a powderhorn and shotbag the governor has sued hedgman for scandal and has ordered lieutenant hall to attend the general court the   th of october as an evidence acquaint mr hall of this and send him down i have got orders from the governor to enlist servants the masters to be paid a reasonable price upon the first purchase deducting for the time they have served you will observe this if any should fall in with you complaint has been made that the officers and soldiers upon party take up the strays they find in the woods let these practices be discouraged ensign roy had my promise to be appointed to my company as it is the company he before belonged to in case my brother did not accept and he has declined it i desire you will send mr roy down immediately to this place i have received no monthly returns which i expected regularly besides weekly ones let all your leisure hours be employed in disciplining the men for as lord loudoun is to be here and will probably see them i would willingly have them make the best appearance possible the wagons must be despatched as soon as possible loaded with powder chiefly the rest with grenades musketball and a quantity of flints with some    lb    lb grapeshot the powder is the most material so let the greater proportion of that be sent the men returned by     the officers abovementioned at this place are employed on the public works but they must still continue them on their rolls and returns and shall have them returned to their companies as soon as they have done here if they belong properly to them waters and burrass behaved extremely ill when they were sent down last if i could lay my hands on them i would try the effect of  000 lashes on the former and whether a general courtmartial would not condemn the latter to a life eternal i shall not at this time enumerate the different kinds of charges laid to both but desire you will enquire minutely of mr burrass what he did with the mare he brought from fort cumberland she was a creature belonging to the heirs of theobald caught by captain ashby for me i intended to have had her appraised and allowed the heirs her full value she was first carried to fort cumberland then brought down by that villain burrass and here sold or swapped i want to know to whom that i may get her and do as i first intended captain peachy applied to me for leave to take up strays c and said it was practised by the marylanders  pennsylvanians if the people of those provinces are guilty of unlawful practices i cannot think it should be any excitement to us to follow their example for under that pretence of getting strays in the mountains is carried on a scene of the greatest iniquity that can be imagined the horses on pattersons creek south branch and other of our deserted settlements hitherwards are taken up sold and made away with to the infinite detriment     and oppression of the people who complain of these grievances in the most sensible manner and urge that they are more oppressed by their own people than by the enemy were there a limitation given the officers might but the soldiers would not observe any and all strays whatever got would be said to come within limited bounds however if you think you can put the garrison of fort cumberland under proper restraints in this particular i would rather that they be benefited by any advantages of this kind than the enemy or those who have no pretence should take them off therefore suffer no horses to be deemed strays or taken up as such which run anywhere below the flats either on the virginia or maryland side and if any are caught above if it is not known to whom they belong let them be appraised by indifferent officers upon their honor and the valuation with the marks and brand be registered in a book for that purpose then let the person who takes such horses up and claims them by this right deliver to the owner if any should come the valuation if such horses should be sold or in his use and service or else to deliver up the horse but if the horse should die be killed or stray away from the fort in what case the person who takes him up not to be answerable for the horse or valuation no person tho is under any pretence to take up with a view of keeping and detaining as his property horses where the owner is known i will by no means consent that any horse below the flats shall be taken upon the above terms lest the property of the people be affected when they may have better     chances of securing their own in the above i have given you my sentiments which you may in a court of officers put under proper articles and heads and made publick to and strictly practised in the garrison under very severe penalties on officers and heavy corporal punishments on the soldiers one thing more i think necessary before any officer or soldier can pretend to lay just claim under the aforesaid articles that it to advertise in the nearest publick places in maryland and virginia such as winchester  fredericktown any horses so taken that the real owners upon procuring attested proof may receive their creatures by coming or sending for them you will receive herewith a cask of shoes containing    dozen pairs which are to be distributed among the needy of the soldiers taking care that account is kept to whom they are delivered so that the price may be stopped from their pay at the usual rates of    per pair and let me be immediately advised of their delivery and payment you will order as strong an escort with the wagons as you can as far as pearsalls and should any of the wagoners want provisions let them be served ordering your commissary to remit an account of it to the commissary here that it may be deducted from their wages george washington   september      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester   september      honble sir i received your favours of the   th  0th and   st ultimo and wrote immediately to the commanding     officers of the counties of prince william culpeper and fairfax to march their drafts to this place there are none of them yet arrived nor do i know whether they are made your honors letter of the   th mentions that i may enlist servants agreeable to the act of parliament but as i have not yet seen that am at a loss how to proceed until i receive your further orders or a copy of the act  it will occasion great murmuring and discontent to the masters if they are not paid immediately for their servants so i hope your honor will order them to make application to you for the money when these points are settled and i have received your honors farther orders i shall send out some officers to recruit it is the best most expeditious nay only method i know of now to recruit the forces as i doubt not we shall meet with as good success as our neighborhood and i am credibly informed an officer of the regulars enlisted  0 in one day in maryland i shall in the meantime recruit all that offer to prevent their leaving the colony but shall be glad of farther instructions a copy of the act i ought to have above all things the men are much satisfied with the augmentation of their pay but nothing will prevent their desertion while they are kindly received and entertained thro     the colony and even under the eye of the civil magistrate perhaps a proclamation of pardon to all who would surrender themselves and return to their duty might be of service those delivered to the constables are always suffered to escape and no notice taken of it all the necessaries i can get in the colony the men do not want for but others indispensably necessary cannot be had we are in great want of drums i got one from colonel randolph we have got no conveniences to mend old drums tho we do the best with what we have which i believe is scarcely more than four very bad ones to the whole regiment and we have drummers for all the companies learning i shall be down at the time your honor directs to wait upon the earl of loudoun i am in hopes they can do without me in napps affair i have ordered lieutenant hall down to the day you appointed  the quakers still remain here and shall until the other drafts are discharged thro the means of their officers chiefly i believe the rangers are quite adverse to enlisting into the regiment cockes tells them they are obliged to serve no longer than he commands them and it was upon these terms they say they enlisted and that they will serve if they can continue under the command of their own captains so they must be discharged as the fund is exhausted they are acquainted with the late encouragement   0 but nothing will engage them to enlist i should be glad of express orders in this affair it may be of service in engaging the tusks to assist us if the nottaways are paid and i refer them to your honor for a consideration the indians are a very covetous people and expect to be well rewarded for the least service i am afraid military threats will not deter the pennsylvanian butchers from driving away the cattle i would have been glad to have received particular directions concerning the provisions as to the quantity and where it must be deposited i fear it is scarcely practicable to get indians to go now to the twightwees i doubt not it would be of service but how it is to be effected i know not as we have no indians in our assistance but those expected from the southward people here in general are very selfish every person expects forces at his own door and is angry to see them at his neighbours i imagine they are much of the same stamp in augusta i wish the new commission for this county may have the intended effect the number of tippling houses kept here is a great grievance all the efforts which have been made here to raise the militia have proved ineffectual war having been proclaimed here and at fort cumberland and the guns from rock creek brought up some time ago ensign fleming in captain hogs absence will be wanted at his post but your honor will be pleased to do as you like in the affair i am glad the cherokees have determined to come to     our assistance and to hear of the firm attachment of them and the catawbas to our interest they will be of particular service—more than twice their number of white men when they arrive which i pray may be soon we may deal with the french in their own way and by visiting their country will keep their indians at home i sent off expresses to enquire for fuzees for them have not yet heard from colonel mason in fredricksburg i am informed there are about    mr hunter of that place informs me that mr george braxton has at least  00 very good light and fit for indians i shall send immediately to fort cumberland for a sufficient quantity of the stores our men are very much harassed in endeavoring to protect the frontiers which the great extent of territory renders impossible to be done properly with our small numbers but we have been happy in being tolerably peaceable and holding our own of late while maryland and pennsylvania fly in the utmost consternation the frontiers of maryland are abandoned for many miles below the blue ridge as low as fredericktown thro which place i am credibly informed no less than   0 wagons transporting the affrighted families passed in the space of three days by which means potowmack river which is now our frontier is deserted on the maryland side  0 miles below conococheague and as much in a parellel below winchester and is now more than any the theater of bloodshed and cruelty those indians who are now coming should be shewed all possible respect and the greatest care     taken of them as upon them much depends t is a critical time they are very humoursome and their assistance very necessary one false step might not only lose us that but even turn them against us all kinds of necessary goods c should be got for them if your honor does not care to trouble yourself about it and please to give me orders and furnish me with money or letters of credit for our paper money passes to great disadvantage and the committee will not agree to provide those necessaries as they expect indian affairs come more properly under your regard i will get them immediately from philadelphia which is the only place that i know of that we can possibly be supplied from sometime ago i wrote to your honor about jenkins pay which you then ordered me to advance but as the committee have ordered that £   0 which i paid him should be got back i thought proper to acquaint your honor with it as i must bring it in now as a private charge against your honor—it being disallowed in my accompt i have also paid the expresses with the declaration of war and the proclamation concerning la force which i shall include in the same accompt and settle with your honor at meeting your honor mentions that when the drafts are discharged the number of officers must be reduced it is true we have a greater number than is necessary for that of the men at present but as it is absolutely necessary to keep the forces and a larger number than we now have i think some     means should be fallen upon to augment them and altho the officers have not complied with their promises i will venture to say they did it as well as any after appointed will do unless some scheme is fallen upon and a better foundation for recruiting and as the most of our present corps are gentlemen of family and have now been sometime in the service i fear we should exchange for the worse if we aim at a change i think it highly necessary some vigorous measures should be taken to engage or compel the deserters to return to their duty it certainly would be of service were the kings attorneys in the several counties ordered to prosecute all who harbour them without respect of persons the immediate loss we suffer for want of their services is greater than the prejudice they do the service in general thro the country by asserting falsehoods of the illtreatment they received from their officers and the great want of every thing in the regiment except bad usage this they do in order to gain the compassion of credulous people who immediately receive them with open arms listen to their complaints and industriously propagate them thro the country and screen the offenders from justice there is one crisp here a shipcarpenter who says he was enlisted by your honor at   per day he is of no service to us now and i should be glad to know what must be done with him and who is to pay his wages for the committee i know will grudge him   per day for which we received no equivalent service of any kind     as it seems uncertain when the assembly will meet i think it my indispensable duty to observe to your honor the bad consequences that may arise from want of proper measures to reinforce the requirement or to keep up a sufficient strength for the protection of the frontiers when the drafts are to be discharged in december  the timorous disposition of the inhabitants occasions much confusion and trouble and constantly are for flying off on the least noise or report of danger and if they are lessened in their sense of security by a reduction of our forces what must then be the event the only body of inhabitants is now and has for some time past been settled on the south branch and it is with the greatest difficulty they can be prevailed upon to stay should they once give way we shall not have a soul betwixt this and fort du quesne except what few soldiers are contained in the little forts on pattersons creek at present affairs are still and peaceable but how long they will remain so is uncertain the french flushed with so much success in all their attempts hitherto may have some grand scheme in view and surprize us as in that most unlucky affair of oswego which i heartily wish may be yet groundless these letters enclosed will show your honor what obstacles we meet with in enlisting servants and as i expect opposition will be made in every place i     send to recruit at i beg your honor would be peremptory and particular in your instructions relative to this affair both as to masters and magistrates mr jones is just came to town from augusta who informs me no account of the cherokees is yet known of in that county so that we need not look for them these two or three weeks yet george washington    september      mount vernon governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie mount vernon    september      honble sir under your kind indulgence i came to this place a few days ago expecting to meet the executors of my deceased brother in order to make a final settlement of his affairs i was disappointed tho in this design by the assembly having called away the principal persons concerned which i was unacquainted with until jenkins return about the same time that i got down i shall remark in obedience to your honors request such things relating to the virginia regiment as occur to me now requiring the assemblys attention  and if any thing further presents itself i shall communicate it from winchester for which place i shall set out this afternoon i have often urged for one thing the necessity of enforcing the articles of war in all their parts where it is not incompatible with the nature of this service i have been surprised as often as i have reflected and really     cannot devise any reason why the assembly should be so much averse to established rules for the regulation of their forces which long experience in established armies fully evinces the necessity of and my surprise is yet increased when i consider how cautiously worded the act of parliament is to preserve the rights and liberties of the people against the arbitrary proceedings of the military officers we are under a kind of regulation at present that renders command extremely difficult and precarious as no crimes i believe are particularly notified but mutiny and desertion in the act of assembly notwithstanding there are many others equally punishable by act of parliament one thing more which particularly requires attention is the billeting quartering and dieting of soldiers upon the inhabitants which in many cases cannot be avoided i have in several letters to your honor expressed my opinion with candor and freedom about the situation works and garrison at fort cumberland i shall nevertheless as you command me to lay before your honor such things as require the assemblys notice repeat on this occasion my apprehensive fears once more for that place to avoid if any accident should happen to it the malicious reflections which inseparably attend misfortunes of the kind i have upon all occasions said that fort cumberland is a place of no strength and never can be tenable from the badness of the ground it is far remote from any of our inhabitants exposed to the insults of the     enemy renders the communication between that and the inhabitants difficult and it is not the more convenient for annoying the enemy contains all our valuable stores save what i have removed to winchester and a garrison of one hundred and seventy which are too many a number to be spared from other places just to defend the stores at this and not enough to afford detachments to waylay and surprise the enemy i shall therefore beg leave to observe in regard to fort cumberland that if it is continued we must be confined to act defensively and keep our forces dispersed as they now are the place must be fortified with strong works or else inevitably fall garrison and stores into the enemys hands how fatal a stroke and what noise this will make the censure of mankind will speedily declare i enclose your honor colonel stephens letter on this head in answer to one i wrote to him on the subject i did from the beginning express my sentiments against having small garrisons in a chain of forts along our frontiers—garrisons not sufficient to defend the walls how then the inhabitants when the enemy are about and shall now give a few reasons upon which this opinion was grounded we have a frontier of such immense extent that to build forts at convenient distances would employ such numbers of men or divide our troops into such trifling parties that no one part could defend itself much less the inhabitants were the country invaded the most effectual way that i can see though none     can answer while we act defensively is to have no more than three or four large strong forts built at convenient distances upon our frontiers in which strong garrisons must be maintained that parties able to cope with when they hear of or do meet the enemy may be sent out and these parties in constant succession to be ranging and scouring the country here a difficulty will arise as others will in every defensive plan that can be offered how are these ranging parties sent out in this manner and probably remaining on the scout from ten to fourteen days to be supplied with provisions the inhabitants being so thinly settled and the forts so far extended the difficulty is great yet not sufficient to render this plan inferior to the former for in the other case when the enemy is heard of the garrison can only send out parties more fit to reconnoiter than oppose these parties if they prove too small which in all probability they may are certain of falling a prey to the enemy whose numbers cannot be known until thus proved i could urge many things more on this head but believe it useless what i have already said i hope is sufficient to give your honor a hint of the matter and that is all i aimed at we may form many schemes to defend ourselves but experience will show that none but removing the cause will prove effectual unless the assembly concerts some measures to augment their force the country i fear must inevitably fall the frontiers since this time a twelve month are totally deserted for fifty miles and upwards quite from north     to south and all below that greatly thinned by the removal of numbers occasioned in some measure by maryland and pennsylvania giving ground so much faster than we do which exposes a very fine country of ours on that side as low as monocacy in maryland several miles on this side the blue ridge i believe i might also add that no person who regards his character will undertake a command without the means of preserving it since his conduct is culpable for all misfortunes and never right but when successful i cannot think any number under two thousand men sufficient to cover our extensive frontiers and with them it is impossible to prevent misfortunes however easy the world may think it what means can be used to raise these men i know not unless the listing servants is thought expedient and that alone will prove ineffectual some resolve should be come to about the ranging companies under what regulations those are in augusta and what service they have done the country i know not those on this quarter have done little service and amount both companies to about thirty men only at this time i apprehend it will be thought advisable to keep a garrison always at fort loudoun for which reason i would beg leave to represent the great nuisance the number of tipplinghouses in winchester are of to the soldiers who by this means in despite of the utmost care and vigilance are so long as their pay holds good incessantly drunk and unfit for service   0 the rates of their liquor are immoderately high and the publicans throughout the country charge one shilling per meal currency for soldiers diet and the country only allows the recruiting officer eight pence per day for the maintenance of a soldier by which means he loses in proportion as he gets men which is much complained of and is in reality a discouraging circumstance meriting redress the want of a chaplain does i humbly conceive reflect dishonor upon the regiment as all other officers are allowed the gentlemen of the corps are sensible of this and did propose to support one at their private expense but i think it would have a more graceful appearance were he appointed as others are i could wish some method were practised to bring the commonalty acquainted with the laws against entertaining of deserters and to enforce those laws more effectually than they ever have been the number of cattle that has been drove and now is continually driving to pennsylvania may be thought worth noticing i informed your honor immediately after my accompts were cursorily examined in april last that the committee objected to the money advanced jenkins and you ordered me to pay him as the money became due which you would see me paid in august last when my accompts were again examined and the same charge still remaining the committee resolved that i should get it back from jenkins which cannot be done unless your honor will please to do it as they have absolutely refused to allow this charge i should be glad to receive directions     how to act with jenkins and to know whether you would have him continued any longer as a rider there is an officer of the american regiment recruiting at alexandria and purposes to go thro the country and pass into carolina he has enlisted some servants and purposes to take all he can meet with this i believe may evince the necessity of our following his example otherwise we suffer our country to be weakened by those and receive no immediate advantage from it tho i imagine the expense will be near the same to the country their being in the kings or countrys service  george washington    september      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester    september      honble sir i arrived here last night and find things in the peaceable state i left them on this quarter and therefore set out tomorrow for augusta as mr     walker has declined it is absolutely necessary to have a commissary immediately appointed who should have express orders where and for what number of men to lay in provisions and should be furnished with cash before he sets out as every thing will be got with less trouble  cheaper by that means the time for buying provisions will soon be elapsed i have ordered the assistant commissary here that time may not be lost to lay in twelve months provision for a thousand men to have at each fort as much provision as will maintain the garrison until the  st may—and the rest to be lodged at this place of safety so that in case an expedition should be determined upon in the spring it may be in readiness and the several garrisons rendezvousd without the incumbrances of transporting stores  provisions these orders i have given not knowing what else would be satisfactory being ignorant of the plans c concerted and acting entirely like a wanderer in unknown paths if it should not corroborate with your honors sentiments  with those of the assembly it is not too late to alter the directions and give any others it is for this purpose i mention it now that your honor may as assembly are sitting appoint the commissary and give me directions what quantity of provision to provide and in what magazines to lodge them and then i will take the blame if it is not done late as the season is the number of little paultry forts along the frontiers render the forces very difficult  expensive to be supplied with provision if the assembly should     continue determined to act defensively and should come into a resolve of building a few forts instead of the many intended i would recommend only one at the most convenient place in each frontier county vizt hampshire augusta  bedford and that the one in hampshire be built on a line betwixt this  fort du quesne and made cannonproof as it lies most exposed and has a free communication for carriages from the enemy as to the others—there being no possibility without first opening the roads to approach them with artillery i conceive if they are built large regular and defensible against musketry it is sufficient—for others will be very expensive i desired to know in my last what should be done with the ranging companies since that i am told they have all deserted to a few their posts must be filled with a company of the regiment from the branch which will occasion fresh uneasiness to the inhabitants as they are continually pestered by the enemy a party of whom was defeated the other day by ensign smith     men of the regiment who killed one man took a number of — moccasins scalping knives and   neat french fuzees as captain mercer is summoned and must appear against napp as i do not at the  th day of the court i expect he will get a supply of cash from the treasurer the last being all gone blankets shirts  cartridgepaper are much wanted for immediate use and must if possible be soon provided as we cannot do without them they have had information on the branch that the     dunkers who are all doctors entertain the indians who are wounded here and that there were several there with them captain spotswood marched out with  0 men to their houses to bring in all he finds there george washington  0 october      halifax governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie halifax  0 october      sir this day within five miles of the carolina line as i was proceeding to the southernmost fort in halifax i met major lewis on his return from the cherokees with seven men and three women only of that nation the causes of this unhappy disappointment i have desired him to communicate that your honor may take measures accordingly  this account is sent by express to give the earliest notice while the assembly is sitting i shall defer giving a particular detail of my remarks and observations on the situation of our frontiers until i return to winchester as i expect by that time to be more intimately acquainted with the unhappy circumstances of the people yet i shall not omit mentioning some occurrences which have happened in my tour to this place i wrote your honor from winchester that i should set out the next day for augusta i accordingly did with captain mcneill and hearing at the courthouse that the indians still continue their depredations     although not so openly as at first i applied to colonel stewart then present to raise a party of the militia and said i would head them and march to jacksons river to try to scour the woods and if possible fall in with the enemy he gave me very little encouragement to expect any men yet desired i would wait four days until monday and he would use his endeavours to collect a body until tuesday i waited and only five men appeared this being too inconsiderable a number to expose to a triumphant enemy i was advised to apply to colonel buchanan for men between whom and colonel stewart there was contention about command as colonel buchanan lived at luneys ferry on james river sixty miles along the road to vosss on the roanoke where captain hog was building a fort to which place i did intend to proceed if i could have got men to range along the frontiers with me i set out immediately for his house attended by captain preston who was kind enough to conduct me along and acquainted the colonel with the motives that brought me thither he told me with very great concern it was not in his power to raise men for that three days before some of the militia in a fort about fifteen miles above his house at the head of catawba creek commanded by one colonel nash was attacked by the indians which occasioned all that settlement to break up totally even to the ferry at luneys that he had ordered three companies to repair thither to march against the enemy and not one man came except a captain lieutenant c and     seven or eight men from bedford finding then that it was impossible to get a party to range and scour the frontiers it remained only to proceed without men to see the situation of the forts or to return back again the latter i was loath to do as i had got thus far and was anxious to see what posture of defence they were in i therefore determined to come forward at least to vosss and accordingly set out in company with colonel buchanan who being desirous that i might see and relate their unhappy circumstances undertook to accompany me we got safely to vosss where captain hog with only eighteen of his company was building a fort which must employ him till christmas without more assistance one captain hunt from lunenburg was there with thirty men but none of them would strike a stroke unless i would engage to see them paid forty pounds of tobacco per day which is provided by act of assembly for militia carpenters this i certainly could not do as your honor who i thought had ordered them purposely out for this duty had given no directions in the affair whatever expectations your honor may have had from the militia assistance i am told they never lent a hand save a few that first came out with captain hog whom he has paid after the same rates with our men at sixpence per diem vosss place is a pass of very great importance being a very great inroad of the enemy and would secure if it was strongly garrisoned all bedford and the greatest part of this county notwithstanding they have built three forts here and one of them if no more     erected in my opinion in a very outoftheway place this they call fort trial from vosss i came off with a servant and a guide to visit the range of forts in this country and in less than two hours after two men were killed along the same road as will appear by captain mcneills letter which i have just received and herewith send to let your honor see by the account of captain hunts behaviour what dependence may be put in the militia the inhabitants are so sensible of their danger if left to the protection of these people that not a man will stay at his place this i have from their own mouths and the principal persons of augusta county the militia are under such bad order and discipline that they will go and come when and where they please without regarding time their officers or the safety of the inhabitants but consulting solely their own inclinations there should be according to your honors orders one third of the militia of these parts now on duty at once instead of that i believe scarce onethirteenth is out they are to be relieved every month they are more than that time marching to and from their stations and will not wait one day longer than the limited time whether they are relieved or not let the necessity for it be ever so urgent an instance of this kind happened in my presence about four days ago in the case of captain daniel from albemarle who was intreated by colonel buchanan to stay at the time he was gathering or attempting to gather men upon that alarm at the catawba settlement before mentioned     but his month was out and go he must and did nay i believe i may venture to say that whether his month had been out or not this would have induced him to go for this gentleman went away from vosss because he thought it a dangerous post giving that for his reason and left captain hog with eighteen men exposed to the insults of the enemy perhaps it may be thought i am partial in my relation and reflect unjustly i really do not sir i scorn to make unjust remarks on the behaviour of the militia as much as i despise and contemn the persons who detract from mine and the character of the regiment were it not that i consulted the good of the public and thought these garrisons merited redress i should not think it worth my mention i only want to make the country sensible how ardently i have studied to promote her cause and wish very sincerely my successor may fill my place more to their satisfaction in every respect than i have been able to do i mentioned in my last to your honor that i did not think a less number than two thousand men would be sufficient to defend our extensive and much exposed frontiers from the ravages of the enemy i have not had one reason to alter my opinion but many to strengthen and confirm it and i flatter myself the country will when they know my determinations be convinced that i have no sinister views no vain motives of commanding a number of men that urge me to recommend this number to your honor but that it proceeds from the knowledge i have acquired of the country people c to be defended     your honor i hope will give directions about laying in provisions on our southern frontiers it is not in my power to do it as i know not what troops can or will be put there for the regiment is at present too weak to allow any men to march from the quarter in which they are now stationed i set out this day on my return to the fort at the head of catawba where colonel buchanan promised to meet me with a party to conduct me along our frontiers up jacksons river to fort dinwiddie and higher if needful if he does not meet me i shall immediately proceed to winchester as it will be impossible to do any thing without men if your honor think proper to advance the pay of the militia in order to engage them to work please to acquaint captain hog therewith and send him money for that purpose and were there more men ordered to cover his party and assist in the work it would be highly advisable for he is greatly exposed major lewis is extremely unwell this express is referred to your honor for pay i have not money to do it i am hurried a good deal but have given a plain account of all those several matters mentioned in the foregoing sheet i am c george washington    october      fort dinwiddie major david lewis to major david lewis  fort dinwiddie    october      sir lieutenant bullet who commands at this place in the absence of captain hog tells me that he applied   0 to you for a few men to join such parties as this garrison can afford—to range the woods and assist the inhabitants in securing their grain gathering their corn c and that you have refused to aid him i conceive if you did so it must have proceeded from a misapprehension of his meaning therefore i apply to you myself on this head and desire your compliance or reasons for refusing i presume sir it will be needless to acquaint you—your own good sense will doubtless evince it that the intent of sending men hither was to protect the frontier inhabitants and offer them comfort by relieving their distresses and wants which will not in any wise be accomplished while you remain in a body at a certain place forted in as if to defend yourselves were the sole end of your coming you will i hope excuse the liberty i have taken in mentioning this affair when i tell you i am in a great measure authorized by the governor to direct in these matters george washington    october      winchester lieutenantcolonel stephen to lieutenantcolonel stephen winchester    october      sir last night i returned from a very long and troublesome jaunt on the frontiers as far as mayo where affairs seem to be in a dangerous situation and to add to our misfortunes i find our neighbourhood here on the wing you and your garrison in great distress  danger the enemy ravaging the country about conogochieg stonyrun and south branch     loud and general complaints for protection few or no men to send abroad for any service—in short so melancholy a scene without the power of changing it to our satisfaction and interest fills me with the greatest anxiety  uneasiness i shall recite you all the governors last letter to me relative to fort cumberland as i had written for his positive directions vizt you have frequently complained to me of the situation c of fort cumberland and i have wrote you how disagreeable it was to me to give up any place of strength as it woud raise the spirits of the enemy at the same time they woud suspect us to be in fear of them and therefore if that place could be stationed  with safety until lord loudoun gives orders thereon i should be glad but as you are upon the spot and think it very prejudicial to the service to keep that fortress i desire you may call a council of officers and consult whether it is most advisable to keep it or to demolish it if the last you must take care to have all the ammunition c brought to winchester and destory every thing which you conceive may be of service to the enemy this affair is now left to the determination of a council of officers and i desire you to be very explicit in your arguments on this head as they must be laid before lord loudoun i was always averse to small garrisons on our frontiers as they in course divided our men into small parties but you know the assembly were so fond of them that they passed a law for that purpose—and i cannot at present alter that determination  thus far his honor as it appears to be an affair     of much importance i cannot pretend to offer my advice but would desire you and the officers there to deliberate seriously in council what you think most proper to be done and send me immediate notice that i may come up with a sufficient number of waggons if to be abandoned to remove the stores and likewise to hold a general court martial on the matter to avoid future reflection i have frequently mentioned my dislike to the place for these reasons—first its insufficiency for any tolerable defence—secondly its distance from the inhabitants—difficulty of communication—and answering no other purpose than burying the service of   0 men in guarding the stores which might be more conveniently done in other forts indeed had we men enough to afford constant scouting parties from that place and coud defend the country hereabouts i shoud approve its being supported and improved in strength on account of the advantages we might expect from it—but as this is not the case i look upon it as rather prejudicial to the country the additional works you mention as necessary to strengthen the fort i cannot consent to without positive orders from the governor as i shoud become answerable from my own estate for such expenses unless commanded by the governor or assembly the assembly is prorogud to the second thursday of next month when we may depend upon some alterations in our present constitution and if you think after the removal of part of the stores it can be maintained till we have their determination—it probably may be more advisable     as his excellency lord loudoun is then expected but upon the whole—as you must be a better judge of your own situation  danger and the governor leaving the affair to a council of officers i refer the case entirely to your discretion hoping you will observe the greatest circumspection  prudence in all your measures so that we may be liable to no blame for any future consequences enclosed is a scheme i intend to offer the assembly if they cannot be persuaded off their defensive notions although i am determined to urge my utmost to evince the advantages and necessity of an offensive campaign as you  every body else must allow that carrying the war into the enemys country is the surest method of peace at home  success abroad and until an attempt is formed against duquesne so as to remove the fountain of all our distrubance and trouble we never may expect a peaceable day the policy of the french is so subtle that not a friendly indian will we have on the continent if we do not soon dislodge them from the ohio i shall exert every power to make this plan go down with the assembly and press them to vigorous measures for the safety and interest of the country preferably to the defensive and demonstrate fully to them every thing i think demands their concern as to the frontiers i also would have you collect whatever comes under your own observation in these respects that we may omit nothing requisite for the assemblys regard as the fund for support of the rangers is long since exhausted the governor avers     them to be discharged you will therefore acquaint the officers and men of these companies that they are discharged accordingly c c  council of war on fort cumberland a council of war held at fort cumberland october  0th      in pursuance of an order received from colonel george washington agreeable to an order from governor dinwiddie to consult whether it is most for the advantage of his majestys service to keep or demolish fort cumberland present lieut colo adam stephen president members capt wm bronaugh capt hen woodward capt robt spotswood capt chas lewis capt wm peachy lt peter steenberger lt austin brockenborough lt james baker lt mordecai buckner ens wm dangerfield ensn edwd hubbard ens nathl thompson ens charles smith ens jno lawson ens griffin pert  in the first place the particular situation and structure of the fort was considered namely—its being built of stockades about nine feet high above ground and never intended for defence against artillery—that it is commanded     by a rising ground about   0 yards n w of the stockades and overlooked by several hills within cannon shot so that no person can move about the place without being seen this is verified in the instance of a french spy lately taken who gave an account exactly of the number of sergeants and soldiers in the garrison—that the barracks are without the fort illbuilt  easily set on fire by the enemy as any number of men can come under the banks of potomac and wills creek within pistol shot of the barracks and fort itself without being exposed to a shot from cannon or small arms—that notwithstanding its small strength  situation it is the only place to the southward of albany exposed to an attack from cannon as there is no other road for carriages of any kind leading thro any pass of the alleghany mountains—that there is no water to be had except from the river or creek—to the latter of which there is a subterraneous passage opened lately but not to be depended upon without a strong garrison to defend it secondly as to the situation of fort cumberland respecting virginia in particular it was considered—that it was a great distance from the inhabitants and consequently the more difficult to be supplied with provisions c—that a strong fortress with a numerous garrison situated somewhere toward the head of the waters of pattersons creek woud contribute more to the immediate protection of the frontiers as that woud be nearer the inhabitants and as near the enemy and warriors path much frequented by scalping parties of them designed against the virginia frontiers—thirdly—upon consideration of the situation of fort cumberland as it regards his majestys service and virginia maryland and pennsylvania in general—it appears that a strong fortress near that place or more advanced towards the enemy well garrisoned is absolutely necessary and woud be of the greatest service for the protection of the frontiers of the three colonies for the following reasons  st the nearer     we are to enemy well supported the more will they dread our incursions and we the more easily command the passes of the alleghany mountains  ly—it appears to us the most imprudent step to leave the only road fit for wheelcarriages in the power of the enemy  ly the command of the river potomack being one of the principal objects which the enemy has in view on this quarter is by all means to be guarded their being masters of it woud forward their designs  help them to penetrate more readily into the heart of the country it is to be observed that it is only about  0 miles landcarriage from the river of monongahela to this place  that the advantageous navigation by small craft and battoes is well known to the french b  fort cumberland and vicinity reduced but not in facsimile from a sketch among the sparks maps in the library of cornell university   the original is on a sheet    ×    inches and is endorsed on the back in washingtons handwriting apparently at a later date sketch of the situation of fort cumberland  from the narrative and critical history of america by courtesy of the publishers c  ly that fort cumberland is about  0 miles from raystown on the frontiers of pennsylvania thro which passes an indian road much frequented by the enemy marching against that province and the frontiers of maryland that it is not much farther from the waters of a creek called the loyal hanan alias camihony  upon which lies the common hunting ground of the indians as they march to and return from war—that the infesting these roads and interrupting them thereabouts woud contribute most of all to the protection of the three provinces next to making incursions into the enemys country and going against their towns it has likewise been considered that the moving the guns c from fort cumberland to winchester would raise the spirits of the enemy and encourage them to make a vigorous attack upon some of the small forts and the inhabitants of the branch that it woud be leaving every thing to chance and running the greatest risque of losing all to move them to any other place on the frontiers before provision is made for reception of the stores and mounting of the     cannon—in case they are removed to winchester there is the greatest reason to think that the whole south branch settlement will break up and that the neighbourhood of winchester nay even to the blue ridge of mountains will in a short time be as much depopulated as the neighbourhood of fort cumberland is at present after a deliberation of two days on the above circumstances—the question being proposed—what was most advisable to be done—it was unanimously agreed as follows vizt that being sensible of the great advantages of a strong garrison in fort cumberland—or at a place further to the westward to his majestys service—that garrison with equity to be supported and maintained by the three provinces as it would contribute equally to the protection of all and be of the greatest service in case of an expedition carried on from potomack to ohio in the spring fort cumberland and the storehouses there woud be particularly useful but in the mean time to pretend to maintain a fort most exposed to an attack of any on the continent with a garrison of   0 men and the place not proof against cannon would be ridiculous  absurd the matter being of so great importance it is possible that on a just representation of circumstances his excellency the right honble the earl of loudoun will give orders about strengthening his majestys fort at wills creek and reinforcing the garrison so as to make it useful in covering the frontiers of the three provinces we also are of opinion that as the designs of the enemy against this place may be retarded for some time by the late capture of a couple of their spies and that their intelligence received from deserters will be rendered of less effect from the pulling down the redoubt and erecting a sort of — — in another place—that it is most advisable to apply to colonel washington for an immediate reinforcement to the garrison—that some of the most valuable stores—not immediately useful for the defence of the fort be removed     to winchester that the works begun for the strengthening of the fort by orders of the commandant upon hearing the enemy were on their march against it be continued and that we defer giving our judgment with respect to keeping or demolishing fort cumberland the only fort belonging to his majesty on this quarter—and desire that our consideration of the case and narration of circumstances be transmitted to governor dinwiddie to whom or to his excellency the right honble the earl of loudoun we leave the decision of the fate of fort cumberland—resolving in the mean time to maintain it as far as lies in our power until we receive orders on that head—begging that we may do so as soon as possible having certain intelligence of the enemys designs against us as soon as it shall be in their power to attack us remarks on the council of war upon receiving orders from his honor governor dinwiddie to hold a council of war upon the necessity of continuing or discontinuing fort cumberland—i immediately directed lt col stephen it being impracticable to attend myself while absent on a tour reviewing the southern frontiers to summon the officers of that fort and the neighboring garrisons to take the affair into their serious consideration their sentiments in my opinion are fully  impartially delivered on the other side both in respect of its condition situation  importance as respecting virginia and the provinces of pennsylvania  maryland in general the situation of fort cumberland is extremely unsuitable for defence and in no ways fit for fortification—and a fort somewhere in that neighbourhood rather more advanced to the westward wellfortified     and strongly garrisoned woud contribute much to the mutual safety  interest of these three colonies because it secures the only gap of the alleghany at present made passable for wheelcarriages and which woud forward an expedition to the ohio now woud the three colonies consent to furnish proportionable supplies for so beneficial and salutary a design—i shoud think it highly expedient to maintain that pass by erecting a fortress of strength towards the little meadows in advance to the enemy which woud give us yet more advantages and fort cumberland woud still answer its present purposes without attempting its improvement while covered by the other or should virginia herself take the weight of this enterprize—or could it be accomplished by any means whatever—i shoud be extremely fond of the expedient but to view fort cumberland in its present defenceless posture relative to virginia in particular—and at this gloomy juncture of affairs—i can not entertain very favourable sentiments of supporting it for these reasons vizt  st tis evident the maryland assembly have given up all their lands above the tonollaways by building fort frederick below—ordering in the inhabitants above—and withdrawing their troops from fort cumberland—from them we may expect small succours—and what hope we may have of pennsylvanias aid towards this salutary purpose i am yet to learn they have large and extensive frontiers and have hitherto acted on the defensive   0  ly fort cumberland lying in the province of maryland  remote from our settlements can of course contribute little to their protection without a numerous garrison is kept therein to detach strong parties to reconnoiter at a distance and waylay the enemy almost at their own homes as there are various paths that lead to the inhabitants without coming near fort cumberland  ly fort cumberland being in maryland it prevents a great part of our force from acting there in consequence of an act of assembly prohibiting those troops to march out of the colony these forces thus restricted are to be discharged the  st december by which means not only fort cumberland but many other places will be rendered so weak without immediate supplies and how easily these are obtained i appeal to sad experience that their conquest woud be easy if attempted lastly—as to the works—they are already well described as quite insufficient to resist a common swivel and must require new improvement if continued which woud be better be bestowed on a new and more suitable situation and without the conjunction of the two provinces to carry on this proposal it woud be next to impossible for virginia which has hitherto defrayed the charge and refuses any further supplies for that purpose to maintain and support his majestys fort under their present feeble force for by putting a garrison there of strength requisite to defend it and keep up the difficult communication with the inhabitants at so great a distance woud employ more than half our     men and of consequence unguard the rest of our frontiers— as to the address of the council to me for reinforcement—they must have known that it was out of my power to grant it the garrison at that place was appointed in consequence of a former council of war and a large proportion of our force alloted to act on the defensive there whilst the remainder were divided for the protection of other places which woud be equally unadvisable to leave open and exposed upon the whole were it at any other time than this—knowing the weakness of our strength doubting the assistance of our neighbours and dreading the consequence of leaving the place longer exposed altho great part of the stores is already removed—i shoud vote for demolishing it but the affair being of great importance i only offer my sentiments and submit to his honor the governor and the approaching assembly for a determination of the case  location of the forts a plan of the number of forts and strength necessary to each extending entirely across our frontiers from south to north—     names of the forts or persons commandg in em on what waters placed distance from each other in miles no of men garrisoning each capt harris mayo   0 galloway smiths

enochs not built cacapehon       maidstone potomack  0     winchester —   00   total  000 this plan is calculated upon the most moderate and easy terms for sparing the country expences and i believe with tolerable justness may answer the design of protecting the inhabitants it may be objected that the distance between some of the forts is too small in answer to which i must observe they are generally fixed upon the heads of creeks c extending towards the alleghany mountains with almost inaccessible mountains between them and are placed in the most commodious manner for securing the inhabitants of such waters some garrisons are larger than others according as they cover a thick or thin settlement the fort at vosss which capt hog is now building is in a much exposed gap subject to the inroads of the southern indians and in a manner covers the greatest part of bedford  halifax     dickinsons is situated for the defence of a once numerous  fertile settlement on the bull cow  calf pastures and lies directly in the shawnese path to ohio and must be a place of rendezvous if an expedition is conducted against the ohio indians below duquesne the garrisons on the potomack waters are yet larger than any because an invasion is most to be dreaded on this quarter it will be seen fort cumberland is not mentioned in this plan if we act only on the defensive a system on which this plan is founded i think it employs a large garrison to very little advantage to virginia if we act offensively it may be of infinite use if properly fortified and the garrison at cockess will then only consist of about  0 or  0 as the rest may be removed to fort cumberland  george washington   november      winchester governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie winchester   november      honble sir in mine from halifax i promised your honor a particular detail of my remarks and observations upon the situation of our frontiers when i arrived at this     place although i was pretty explicit in my former i cannot avoid recapitulating part of the subject now as my duty and its importance for redress are strong motives from fort trial on smiths river i returned to fort william on the catawba where i met colonel buchanan with about thirty men chiefly officers to conduct me up jacksons river along the range of forts with this small company of irregulars with whom order regularity circumspection and vigilance were matters of derision and contempt we set out and by the protection of providence reached augusta courthouse in seven days without meeting the enemy otherwise we must have fallen a sacrifice through the indiscretion of these whooping hallooing gentlemen soldiers this jaunt afforded me an opportunity of seeing the bad regulation of the militia the disorderly proceedings of the garrisons and the unhappy circumstances of the inhabitants first of the militia the difficulty of collecting them on any emergency whatever i have often spoken of as grievous and i appeal to sad experience both in this and other counties how great a disadvantage it is the enemy having every opportunity to plunder kill and escape before they can afford any assistance and not to mention the expensiveness of their service in general i can instance several cases where a captain lieutenant and i may add an ensign with two or three sergeants and six or eight men will go upon duty at a time the proportion     of expense in this case is so unjust and obvious your honor wants not to be proved then these men when raised are to be continued only one month on duty half of which time is lost in their marching out and home especially those from the adjacent counties who must be on duty some time before they reach their stations by which means double sets of men are in pay at the same time and for the same service again the waste of provision they make is unaccountable no method or order in being served or purchasing at the best rates but quite the reverse allowance for each man as other soldiers do they look upon as the highest indignity and would sooner starve than carry a few days provision on their backs for conveniency but upon their march when breakfast is wanted knock down the first beef c they meet with and after regaling themselves march on until dinner when they take the same method and so for supper likewise to the great oppression of the people or if they chance to impress cattle for provision the valuation is left to ignorant and indifferent neighbours who have suffered by those practices and despairing of their pay exact high prices and thus the public is imposed on at all events i might add i believe that for the want of proper laws to govern the militia by for i cannot ascribe it to any other cause they are obstinate selfwilled perverse of little or no service to the people and very burthensome to the country every mean individual has his own crude notions of things and must undertake to direct if his advice is neglected     he thinks himself slighted abused and injured and to redress his wrongs will depart for his home these sir are literally matters of fact partly from persons of undoubted veracity but chiefly from my own observations secondly concerning the garrisons i found them very weak for want of men but more so by indolence and irregularity none i saw in a posture of defence and few that might not be surprised with the greatest ease an instance of this appeared at dickinsons fort where the indians ran down caught several children playing under the walls and had got to the gate before they were discovered was not vosss fort surprised and a good many souls lost in the same manner they keep no guard but just when the enemy is about and are under fearful apprehensions of them nor ever stir out of the forts from the time they reach them till relieved on their month being expired at which time they march off be the event what it will so that the neighborhood may be ravaged by the enemy and they not the wiser of the ammunition they are as careless as of the provisions firing it away frequently at targets for wagers on our journey as we approached one of their forts we heard a quick fire for several minutes and concluded for certain that they were attacked so we marched in the best manner to their relief but when we came up we found they were diverting at marks these men afford no assistance to the unhappy settlers who are drove from their plantations either in securing their harvests or gathering in their     corn lieutenant bullet commanding at fort cumberland sent to major lewis of albemarle who commanded a party of sixty militia at millers about fifteen miles above him where were also thirty men of augusta for some men to join his small parties to gather the corn major lewis refused assistance and would not divide his men i wrote to him but got no answer mr bullet has done what he could with his few men not quite thirty of the many forts which i passed by i saw but one or two that had their captains present they being absent chiefly on their own business and had given leave to several of the men to do the same yet these persons i will venture to say will charge the country their full months pay  thirdly the wretched and unhappy situation of the inhabitants needs few words after a slight reflection on the preceding circumstances which must certainly draw after them very melancholy consequences without speedy redress they are truly sensible of their misery they feel their insecurity from militia preservation     who are slow in coming to their assistance indifferent about their preservation unwilling to continue and regardless of every thing but their own ease in short they are so affected with approaching ruin that the whole back country is in a general motion towards the southern colonies and i expect that scarce a family will inhabit frederick hampshire or augusta in a little time they petitioned me in the most earnest manner for companies of the regiment but alas it is not in my power to assist them with any except i leave this dangerous quarter more exposed than they are i promised at their particular request to address your honor and the assembly in their behalf and that a regular force may be established in lieu of the militia and ranging companies which are of much less service and infinitely more cost to the country were this done the whole would be under one direction and any misbehaviour could never pass with impunity whereas the others are soldiers at will and in fact will go and come when and where they please without regarding the orders or directions of any and indeed the manner in which some of the ranging captains have obtained their commissions if i am rightly informed is by imposture and artifice they produce a list i am told to your honor of sundry persons who are willing to serve under them one part it is said are of fictitious names another the names of persons who never saw the list and the remainder are persons drawn into it by fallacious promises that cannot be complied with without     detriment to the service but were it otherwise surely any person who considers the pay of the soldiers and that of the militia will find a considerable difference tho both under the best regulations as defensive measures are evidently insufficient for the security and safety of the country i hope no arguments are requisite to convince of the necessity of altering them to a vigorous offensive war in order to remove the cause  but should the assembly still indulge that favorite scheme of protecting the inhabitants by forts along the frontiers in which many of them too put their dependence and as the building of these forts has been encouraged and confirmed by an act of the assembly i take the liberty to present your honor with a plan of the number of forts and strength necessary to each reaching entirely across our frontiers from north to   0 south this plan is calculated upon the most moderate and easy terms for sparing the countrys expense and i believe with tolerable propriety to answer the wishedfor design of protecting the settlers besides most of the forts are already built by the countrypeople or soldiers and require but little improvement save one or two as dickinsons and coxs your honor will see fort cumberland excluded in this list the advantage of having the militia in augusta c under one command i have already hinted at and i think major lewis should have your honors orders to take that duty in hand with directions and orders to secure those important passes of dickinsons and vosss by building a fort in the neighbourhood of dickinsons or by other means and were it practicable to get the people to assemble in little towns contiguous to these forts it would contribute much to their mutual peace and safety during the continuance of the indian war  the augusta people complain greatly for want of money the other day eleven indians of the catawba tribe came here and we undoubtedly might have had more of them had the proper means been used to send trusty guides to invite and conduct them to us but this is neglected one matthew tool makes his     boast of stopping them until he shall be handsomely rewarded for bringing them and major lewis can inform your honor of one bemer who uses every method to hinder the cherokees from coming to our assistance complaint should be made to governor littleton of these persons indian goods are much wanted to reward the catawbas and encourage them to engage in our service in what manner are they to be paid for scalps are our soldiers entitled to the reward like indifferent people it is a tedious and expensive way to defer payment until proved and sent to your honor your honor and the assembly should determine these points and many others very essential vizt a proper method of paying rewards for taking up deserters the present being very discouraging in delaying payment until courts of claims c means to replace the drafts that must be discharged in december ascertaining the pay of workmen employed on all public works or empowering the commanding officer to agree on the cheapest terms with them how the servants enlisted for the virginia regiment are to be paid for we have already recruited fifty odd and are daily dunned for payment by the masters a report prevails to my great surprise tho disbelief that your honor had told some persons who applied to you for satisfaction for their servants that i had no orders to enlist any this false rumor occasions very strange reflections and must make me appear in a very unjust light to the world i have therefore desisted from recruiting until your honor     directs me in what manner those already obtained are to be satisfied and i beg your honor will give me immediate advice on the affair as the people are impatient and threaten us with prosecutions from all quarters your honor has herewith a copy of the council of war held in behalf of fort cumberland in which the arguments are justly and fully laid down both with regard to virginia in particular and in general as to the three colonies whose mutual interest highly concerns and should be by them equitably supported on the back of the copy are my sentiments on the matter candidly offered your honor and to your honor i leave the determination of this important affair with the officers of the council i have frequently wrote your honor desiring you would appoint a commissary in lieu of mr walker who has declined acting and been absent for many months but as i never had your honors answer i have in consequence of your first and since repeated instructions made choice of a person who i believe will do that duty with every necessary diligence and care and hope your honor will approve my proceeding the £ 00 paid colo stephen of the rangers money by colonel fairfax have already been accounted for to the committee i have since received from colo fairfax £      on the countrys credit and to be settled with my other accompts as touching a chaplain if the government will grant a subsistence we can readily get a person of     merit to accept of the place without giving the commissary any trouble on that point as it is highly necessary we should be reformed from those crimes and enormities we are so universally accused of  your honor has had advice of two spies that were taken at fort cumberland one of whom they quickly hung up as his just reward being a deserter the other was sent to governor sharpe to give information of the infernal practices followed by some of the priests of that province in holding correspondence with our enemy  i am c n b i am just setting out for fort cumberland george washington    november      alexandria governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie alexandria    november      honble sir at this place on my way to williamsburg i received your honors letter of the   th instant  and     shall take care to pay the strictest obedience to your orders and the opinion so far as i can the detachment ordered from winchester exceeds i believe the number of enlisted men we have there and the drafts which made our strength at that place to consist of about one hundred and sixty men will leave us in seven days i have no hope of enlisting any nor prolonging their stay as we have heretofore engaged those who were willing to serve however my true endeavors shall be strictly aiding for this more than ever necessary purpose i am very sorry any expression in my letter should     be deemed unmannerly i never intended insults to any on the contrary have endeavoured to demean myself in that proper respect due to superiors in the instance mentioned i can truly say so far from intending a charge or affront of any kind it was distant from my thoughts and i meant no more than to show what strange what unaccountable infatuation prevailed among the magistrates c of the back parts of carolina who were so regardless of the common cause as to allow fifty catawbas to return when they had proceeded near seventy miles on their march for want of provisions and a conductor to entice them along this was a fact i did not suppose your honor was uninformed of knowing colonel cobb had wrote you on the subject i therefore thought i might be less explicit and not have incurred this censure by that means i seem also to be reprimanded for giving a vague account of my tour to the southward i was rather fearful of blame for prolixity and impertinence in meddling with matters i had no immediate concern with and related them rather as hints to set you upon inquiring than as a circumstantial account of the facts and this i chose more especially to do as colonels lewis and buchanan from whom being heads of the militia these representations fully authenticated more properly came and they were represented at least by the latter then on his road to do so and had as he told me taken the testimony and depositions of several persons for this purpose in order to demonstrate the thing more     clearly and to show who had and who had not done their duty when i went to augusta it was with a good design—to relieve if possible a much distressed settlement but finding this impracticable without men and hearing some complaints of captain hog and at the same time being desirous of seeing in what manner he proceeded i continued on in no small danger yet pleased with reflecting on this extraordinary duty and of bringing myself more intimately acquainted with the situation of our frontiers which sir i related as well as i was capable with a design from which i have never intentionally swerved to serve my country and am sorry to find that this and my best endeavours of late meet with unfavorable constructions what it proceeds from i know not if my open and disinterested way of writing and speaking has the air of pertness and freedom i shall correct my error by acting reservedly and shall take care to obey my orders without offering any thing more i should not have presumed to have appointed a commissary had not your first instructions been plain and explicit on this point and reiterated letters since that invested me with power the omission of the name was a neglect indeed accidental not designed the gentleman intended was mr ramsay of this place wellknown wellesteemed and of unblemished good character practised in business and comes now properly recommended i should not have appointed this gentleman or any other to serve as commissary had not mr walker in repeated letters desired it and his     absence from and neglect of duty rendered another highly necessary this i presume you were unacquainted with when you desired his continuance nor may you know that mr walker intends to reside at home and act by a deputy which if i may be allowed to say is equally inconsistent as if i were to do it this it is that encourages mr ramsay to wait upon your honor to be thoroughly informed as the duty now will become more divided between fort cumberland and the lower forts it may not be thought amiss if mr ramsay is appointed to join a second in the commission the business by this means must be conducted infinitely better and in that case i would beg leave to mention mr carlyle who is willing to act and whose knowledge and experience in this business are so well known and need no recapitulation they are both agreed to hold it in conjunction upon the same terms that mr walker now has it when i spoke of a chaplain it was in answer to yours i had no person in view tho many have offered and only said if the country would provide subsistence we could procure a chaplain without thinking there was offence in the expression because i was told the commissary had endeavored but could get no one to accept of it when i spoke about scalps i had the indians chiefly indeed solely in my view knowing their jealous suspicious natures are apt to entertain doubts of the least delay and a suspension of rewards causes a dissatisfaction and murmuring among them which might be productive     of bad events at this critical juncture  so soon as i march from winchester which will immediately happen as i am setting out thence and sent orders by jenkins to have the troops paid and in readiness to march i shall write your honor a more distinct account of the situation of that place which will be left entirely destitute of all protection notwithstanding it now contains all the public stores of any importance as they were removed from fort cumberland and in the most dangerous part of our frontiers at least in a part that has suffered this summer more than any which has been so well secured by the ravages of the enemy the works which have been constructed and conducted on with infinite pains and labor will be unfinished and exposed and the materials for completing the building which have been collected with unspeakable difficulty and expense left to be pillaged and destroyed by the inhabitants of the town because as i before observed one hundred men will exceed the number i am pretty confident which we have there when the drafts go off so to comply with my orders which i shall literally do if i can not a man will be left there to secure the works or defend the kings stores which are almost wholly removed to that place     george washington   december      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun   december      honble sir when i wrote your honor from alexandria i expected to have been at or near fort cumberland by this but upon coming here and expecting wagons and provisions in readiness to go up with this escort i received the enclosed from the commissary which i send to evince that no delays or protracting of orders proceed from me the return of our strength which i called in so soon as i arrived is herewith sent signed by the adjutant amounting exclusive of the drafts to eightyone effectives including the sick and young drummers who were sent here to learn when captain mercer went down our strength consisted of about twentyfive more including drafts which have been sent ever since the middle of october to conococheague swearingens ferry c to encourage that body of inhabitants to stay at their places who otherwise were determined to forsake them your honors late and unexpected order has caused the utmost terror and consternation in the people and will i fear be productive of numberless evils not only to this place and the public works erecting here but to the country in general who seem to be in the greatest dread for the consequences the stores of every kind have all been brought from fort cumberland save those indispensably necessary there at a very great expense and lie in the courthouse and other public buildings to the no small inconvenience and detriment of the county i have   0 frequently been importuned by the members of the court and other public officers to remove them and have as often by gentle persuasives protracted the time which was the more cheerfully granted as it was evident that there were no other places to receive them and that i strove with the utmost diligence to prepare the proper receptacles what course to take with them now i know not and hope you will direct i am convinced were your honor informed how much this place which is in every degree our utmost and most exposed frontier there being no inhabitants between this and the branch and none there but what are forted in—i say i am convinced if your honor were truly informed of the situation of this place of its importance and danger you would not think it prudent to leave such a quantity of valuable stores exposed to the insults of a few for a very few indeed might reduce them and the town too to ashes in the next place as i observed in my last letter the works which have been begun and continued with labor and hardship lie open untenable and exposed to the weather to say no more and the materials which have been collected with cost and infinite difficulty to the mercy of every pillager our timber and scantling used and burnt by the towns people our plank which has been brought from far stolen and destroyed and the lime if not stolen left to be wasted c c and this is not the worst a building which in time might and would have been very strong and defensible and an asylum in the greatest danger in a manner totally     abandoned as the case now stands we have no place tenable no place of safety all is exposed and open to attacks and by not having a garrison kept at this place no convoys can get up to us and the communication with the inhabitants entirely cut off so that soldiers and inhabitants cannot be assisting each other in regard to myself residing at fort cumberland i shall lay before your honor such inconveniences as must unavoidably arise while we pursue these defensive measures in doing which i think i only do my duty first as fort cumberland lying more advanced and wide of all other forts will prevent me from having the immediate direction of any but that secondly the stores being at this place and i at that will render it impossible to deliver them regularly i either must trust to a subaltern officer to order them discretionally or else an express must be first sent to me and then i must send to the storekeeper to deliver the necessaries wanting to each garrison how inconsistent this is for many reasons your honor may judge but more especially when it is known that there is no travelling to fort cumberland but endangering of life without a pretty strong escort thirdly by being at fort cumberland a total stagnation of business must ensue because money is lodged with me for discharging all contingent expenses arising in the service and no persons will or can come to me there in course they will be slack in furnishing us with wagons and necessaries of every kind which now by due payment may be had at call     and lastly winchester is in the center as it were of all the forts is convenient for receiving intelligence and distributing orders and notwithstanding any thing to the contrary lies in a vale of land that has suffered more than any other from the incursions of the enemy i hope after receiving a peremptory order the mentioning of these things will not appear presuming or odd i do not hesitate a moment to obey on the contrary shall comply the minute i can i mean nothing more than to point out the consequences that must necessarily attend as i apprehend your honor was not thoroughly apprised of our situation some sir who are inclined to put an unfavorable construction upon this generous recital may say that i am loath to leave this i declare upon my honor i am not but had rather be at fort cumberland if i could do my duty there a thousand times over for i am tired of the place the inhabitants and the life i lead here and if after what i have said you should think it necessary that i reside at that place i shall acquiesce with pleasure and cheerfulness and be freed from much anxiety plague and business to be at fort cumberland sometimes i think highly expedient and have hitherto done it three weeks ago i came from that place i have used every endeavour to detain the drafts but all in vain they are homesick and tired of work they all declare if an expedition is conducted in the spring they will serve two three or four months these tho are words of course the catawbas are out on the scout with an officer and some     men of ours they proposed when i was at fort cumberland to stay only one moon and then to set out for their nation with a report of the country and its conveniences to the enemy but rather with a report of our usage i believe it therefore behooves us to reward them well and keep them in temper they applied to me for several necessaries such as each a suit of clothes wampum pipe tomahawks and silver trinkets for the wrists and arms c the wampum and tomahawks i have purchased the want of the others may occasion some murmuring and there are very few things suitable at fort cumberland they seemed very desirous that an officer should return with them and gave strong assurances of his bringing in a number if your honor approves it i shall endeavour to fix upon some officer that falls most in with their customs and send him upon this duty the indians expect to be sent back upon horses does your honor approve that they should i will not take upon me to buy horses without your orders the cherokees are not yet arrived nor the arms from augusta i am c george washington   december      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun   december      honble sir since writing to your honor yesterday a very base and villainous scheme has been discovered which has been i believe the sole cause of    soldiers     deserting from us last night the gentleman concerned is our late ensign denis mccarty of whose character and practises the enclosed depositions will afford your honor a specimen and with whom all his ties of honor and morality are of no force by virtue of your honors commission to recruit for the royal american regiments and under the specious pretence of immunity offered in a late proclamation he boasts the power  authority of enlisting deserters and delinquents of any kind whatever with these pretences  his ungenerous principles he scandalously  underhandedly seduced these and i am afraid many more to abandon their duty and desert the service the behaviour of mr mccarty while in our regiment was not so becoming and genteel as it ought and had he not apprehended the danger of a court martial with disgrace he would not have resigned to your honor with so much privacy i hope this flagrant instance of his unnatural unjust and dishonorable proceedings will prompt your honor to punish such pernicious practises so destructive in their consequences and so fatal in their effects i have despatched a party of    men under capt mercer with orders that every endeavour and all possible diligence be made use of to apprehend those deserters who i imagine are gone to mccarty and should be glad your honor woud direct what punishment shoud be inflicted as the act for that purpose is sometime ago expired the loss of the drafts and those desertions render us unable to manage such heavy timber as is     required about the fort or even sufficient to do other necessary work there these misfortunes and the want of flour with the commissary conspire to retard my march longer than i had expected george washington  0 december      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun  0 december      honble sir capt mercer returned the  th with sixteen of the deserters the other two escaped his diligence they confirm the suspicion of mr mccartys villany by confessing he had inveigled them with promises of protection rewards and good usage and a deeplaid plan was concerted for accomplishing his base designs—binding each individual with an oath to follow him to stand true to each other in case of being pursued to kill the officer who attempted the command and in case of a separation private instructions to repair to mccarty or some of his friends who were to receive and entertain them these proceedings and the within depositions must convince your honor how dangerous a person of mr mccartys principles must be to the peace and quiet of society the soldiers surrendered to capt mercer upon promise of pardon and as they seem sorry for their behaviour assuring all duty and obedience for the future i thought it most expedient to forgive them knowing we have no law at present to punish them     and believing the poor ignorant fellows less culpable than their seducer i hope your honor will therefore approve of my measures in this matter before this reaches your honor i imagine you will have received capt john mcneills relative to the servants recruited in augusta—i desired him to transmit the valuation of them according to your honors directions fully authenticated in order to receive the money capt mcneills distance from me deprived me of the opportunity of certifying the accompts and to prevent loss of time expence and trouble i ordered him to take this method which i hope will not be disagreeable to your honor upon receiving your honors and the councils resolve to make fort cumberland tenable i wrote to lt colonel stephen to set immediately about it but the want of tools for three parts of the men there will prevent its progress at alexandria i gave orders to purchase a quantity and colonel carlyle had gone to annapolis for that purpose so i look daily for the tools the demand upon us at this time for money is very great buying provision c we have almost exhausted the last sum received and must be under the necessity of applying to your honor for another supply in a little time we long much for the arrival of the soldiers clothing the weather very severe the service hard and men naked—are motives too strong for their accepting the specious promises of mccarty and others     george washington    december      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun    december      honble sir your letter of the  0th came to hand the   th in consequence of which i despatched orders immediately to all the garrisons on the branch to evacuate their forts and repair to pearsalls where they would meet the flour c from this place and to escort it to fort cumberland i expect the provisions purchased for the support of these forts and now lying in bulk will be wasted and destroyed notwithstanding i have given directions to the assistant commissary on the branch and to waggeners company to use their utmost diligence in collecting the whole and securing them where his company is posted an escort with all the flour we have been able to procure which amounts to an insufficient quantity for want of water sets out from this on tuesday next i expect to depart sooner myself after leaving directions with captain mercer whom i have appointed to command here and shall repair as expeditiously as possible to fort cumberland i am a little at loss to understand the meaning of your honors orders and the opinion of the council when i am directed to evacuate all the stockade forts and at the same time to march only one hundred men to fort cumberland and to continue the like number here to garrison fort loudoun if the stockade forts are all abandoned there will be more men than are required for these two purposes and the communication between them of near eighty miles will     be left without a settler unguarded and exposed  but i mean nothing by asking this question than to know your honors intentions which i would willingly pay strict obedience to mr walker has been here settled his accompts and gone home again fully resolved no longer to continue commissary i acquainted him with the contents of your honors letters of november and he has wrote you he tells me his reasons for resigning what indian goods were left by colo innes i know not no return was ever given to me nor to the commanding officer when he went away if i am rightly informed i shall when i arrive at fort cumberland get a return of them and transmit to your honor a return of the stores at this place is enclosed i should have sent it before but waited to add those at fort cumberland of which there are none yet come down if captain mcneill goes to the cherokee nation it would be well for him to conduct the catawbas home but when i recommended an officers going with     them it was with a view of engaging a body of their men to come to our assistance in the spring and to march in with their warriors not choosing to trust altogether to their unmeaning promises and capricious humors but your honor will be pleased to direct as you see proper in this affair i have advanced very little money hitherto to the masters of servants because i waited your directions on this head i received fortyone last night from captain mcneill who desires leave to continue recruiting i do not consent to it until i know whether it is agreeable to your honor and whether i may send out as many other officers as can be spared for the same service if this is approved of i should be glad that your honor would send me general instructions that i may know how to give mine and to act consistently with the rules for recruiting servants for his majestys regiments i should have been exceedingly glad if your honor and the council had directed in what manner fort cumberland is to be strengthened i e whether it is to be made cannonproof or not and that you would fix the sum beyond which we shall not go for i must look to you for the expense knowing that the country has already rejected some articles of this immediately upon receiving your honors letter to mccarty i enclosed it to colonel fairfax as directed and desired him to do what is needful in regard to the commission as it was not in my power to deal with him as he deserved first because he has left this service and next because if he was still in it we have no martial law to punish  00 him the mutiny and desertion act having expired in october last the same with respect to the soldiers but their penitent behavior induced me to pass by their faults i have read that paragraph in lord loudouns letter which your honor was pleased to send me over and over again but am unable to comprehend the meaning of it what scheme it is i was carrying into execution without waiting advice i am at a loss to know unless it was building the chain of forts along our frontiers which i not only undertook conformably to an act of assembly and by your own orders but with respect to the places in pursuance of a council of war if under these circumstances my conduct is responsible for the fate of fort cumberland it must be confessed that i stand upon a tottering foundation indeed i cannot charge my memory with either proposing or intending to draw the forts nearer to winchester the garrison of fort cumberland it is true i did wish to have removed to coxs which is nearer to winchester by twentyfive miles but not further from the enemy than where it now is if a road from thence to the little meadows which is about twenty miles distant and the same from that place i e fort cumberland and more in the warriors path was opened however i see with much regret that his excellency lord loudoun seems to have prejudged my proceedings without being thoroughly informed what were springs and motives that have actuated my conduct how far i have mistaken the means to recommend my services i know not but i am certain  0  of this that no man ever intended better or studied the interest of his country with more affectionate zeal than i have done and nothing gives me greater uneasiness and concern than that his lordship should have imbibed prejudices so unfavorable to my character as to excite his belief that i was capable of doing any thing that will have a bad effect as to the dominion and no good appearance at home as i had your honors permission to be down when his lordship shall favor us with a visit i desired colonel carlyle to inform me when he should pass thro alexandria and i will set out accordingly i hope nothing has intervened to alter this indulgence it is a favor i should not have thought of asking had i believed the service would suffer in my absence but i am convinced it will not and i cannot help saying i believe we are the only troops upon the continent that are kept summer and winter to the severest duty with the least respite or indulgence captn pearis came to town the other day with six cherokees and two squaws he brought no orders from your honor and applies to me for direction of his services i have desired him to carry the indians to fort cumberland—as we can make nothing of them without an interpreter—and there wait the return of your honors instructions lt baker has leave of absence upon very urgent business relative to an estate left him he applied to your honor and having received no answer i made free to grant this indulgence in so material a point lt lowry  0  has applied for permission to quit the service i referred him to your honor and he now waits your answer in a state of much anxiety and sickness his resignation i apprehend will occasion no void or any loss to the service i have therefore allowed him to go down in order to support his spirits and comply with your honors pleasure whatever that be while lt baker is absent i would offer it to your honor as expedient he should make interest among the tusks and nottoways his intimacy with these nations may be of service in engaging some assistance from them and i think him very capable of the undertaking he might also recruit if your honor approves of the proposal i have already offered the delay of the soldiers clothes occasions unaccountable murmurs and complaints and i am very much afraid we shall have few men left if they arrive not in a week or two your honor would be astonished to see the naked condition of the poor wretches and how they possibly can subsist much less work in such severe weather is not easy to conceive had we but blankets to give them or any thing to defend them from the cold they might perhaps be easy i have formerly hinted to your honor our necessity for a speedy supply of cash and have advised with the speaker likewise that he might not be unprepared i purpose to send down by the  0th of next month or sooner if i could be served the men are quite impatient and the want of small bills is very prejudicial to their peace i should be glad your  0  honor would advise per return of jenkins how soon i may send down i cannot supply your honor with a return of our strength as yet because our scattered disposition hinders a regular discharge of the adjutants duty i am c george washington    december      winchester john robinson to john robinson winchester    december      sir you are no stranger i presume to the late resolutions of the governor and council the consequence of which i meditate with great concern we are ordered to reinforce fort cumberland with one hundred men and to enable me to carry that number thither all the stockade forts on the branch are to be evacuated and in course all the settlements abandoned except what lie under the immediate protection of captain waggeners fort the only place exempted in their resolve surely his honor and the council are not fully acquainted with the situation and circumstances of the unhappy frontiers thus to expose so valuable a tract as the branch in order to support a fortification in itself considering our present feebleness of very little importance to the inhabitants or the colony the former order of council would have endangered not only the loss of fort loudoun the stores and winchester but a general removal of the settlers of this vale even to the blue ridge this last hath the same object in view vizt fort cumberland and to maintain it the best lands  0  in virginia are laid open to the mercy of a cruel and inhuman enemy these people have long struggled with the dangers of savage incursions daily soliciting defence and willing to keep their ground to encourage them all my little help has been administered and they seemed satisfied with my intentions resolving to continue while any probability of support remained the disposition i had made of our small regiment gave general satisfaction to the settlements and content began to appear everywhere the necessary measures for provisions and stores were agreeably concerted and every regulation established for the season but the late command reverses confuses and incommodes every thing to say nothing of the extraordinary expense of carriage disappointments losses and alterations which must fall heavy on the country whence it arises or why i am truly ignorant but my strongest representations of matters relative to the peace of the frontiers are disregarded as idle and frivolous my propositions and measures as partial and selfish and all my sincerest endeavours for the service of my country perverted to the worst purposes my orders are dark doubtful and uncertain today approved tomorrow condemned left to act and proceed at hazard accountable for the consequences and blamed without the benefit of defence if you can think my situation capable to excite the smallest degree of envy or afford the least satisfaction the truth is yet hid from you and you entertain notions very different from the reality of the case however i am determined to  0  bear up under all these embarrassments some time longer in hope of better regulation on the arrival of lord loudoun to whom i look for the future fate of virginia his lordship i think has received impressions tending to prejudice by false representations of facts if i may judge from a paragraph of one of his letters to the governor and on which is founded the resolve to support fort cumberland at all events the severity of the season and nakedness of the soldiers are matters of much compassion and give rise to infinite complaints nor is it possible to obvitate them unless their clothing come in immediately you would be surprised how the poor creatures live much more how they can do duty had we but blankets they might be appeased for a little time and as we have not i fear many will desert i advised you formerly of our necessity for cash and would earnestly desire it soon i think of sending down by the  0th of next month or sooner if agreeable please to inform me by jenkins what i may depend upon on that head as our men are impatient and with some reason when without both money and clothes i need not urge the comparative advantage of small bills as you are truly sensible how disadvantageous large ones are in paying individuals and occasioning many other inconveniences we shall have occasion for at least six thousand pounds to clear us to the  st of january the commissary wants above half that sum to furnish his stocks of provisions c the other will be exhausted in paying  0  the troops we ought always to have money in hand as we are often reduced to many inconveniences on account of waiting for it not to mention the expense and trouble  mr kirkpatrick will have my accompts to lay before the committee and will shew how the money has been applied george washington december      to the speaker of the house of burgesses december      dear sir it gave me infinite concern to hear by several letters that the assembly are incensed against the virginia regiment and think they have cause to accuse the officers of all inordinate vices but more especially of drunkenness and profanity how far any one individual may have subjected himself to such reflections i will not pretend to determine but this i am certain of and can with the highest safety call my conscience my god and what i suppose will still be a more demonstrable proof at least in the  0  eye of the world the orders and instructions which i have given to evince the purity of my own intentions and to shew on the one hand that my incessant endeavours have been directed to discountenance gaming drinking swearing and other vices with which all camps too much abound while on the other i have used every expedient to inspire a laudable emulation in the officers and an unerring exercise of duty in the soldiers how far i may have mistaken the means to attain so salutary an end behooves not me to determine but this i presume to say that a mans intentions should be allowed in some respects to plead for his actions i have been more explicit sir on this head than i otherwise shoud because i find that my own character must of necessity be involved in the general censure for which reason i can not help observing that if the country think they have cause to condemn my conduct and have a person in view that will act that he may do but who will endeavour to act more for her interests than i have done it will give me the greatest pleasure  0  to resign a command which i solemnly declare i accepted against my will i know sir that my inexperience may have led me into innumerable errors for which reason i shoud think myself an unworthy member of the community and greatly deficient in the love i owe my country which has ever been the first principle of my actions were i to require more than a distant hint of its dissatisfaction to resign a commission which i confess to you i am no ways fond of keeping these sentiments i communicate to you sir not only as to a gentleman for whom i entertain the highest respect and greatest friendship but also as a member of the assembly—that the contents if you think proper may be communicated to the whole for be assured i shall never wish to hold a commission when it ceases to be by unanimous consent the unhappy differences which subsisted so long about command did i own prevent me from going to fort cumberland to enforce those orders which i never failed to send there and caused i dare say many gross irregularities to creep into that garrison which you know is in another colony but whose fault was that ought it not to have been attributed to the officer commanding there capt dagworthy whose business it was to suppress vice in every shape surely it was however i am far from attempting to vindicate the characters of all the officers for that i am sensible would be a task too arduous there are some who have the seeds of idleness too strongly instilled  0  into their constitution either to be serviceable to themselves or beneficial to the country yet even those have not missed my best advice nor have my unwearied endeavours ever been wanting to serve my country with the highest integrity for which reasons i shoud ever be content in retirement and reflect with no little pleasure that no sordid views have influenced my conduct nor have the hopes of unlawful gains swerved me in any measure from the strictest dictates of honor i have diligently sought the public welfare and have endeavoured to inculcate the same principles on all that are under me these reflections will be a cordial to my mind so long as i am able to distinguish between good  evil to the worshipful the speaker and gentlemen of the house of burgesses the address of the officers of the virginia regiment the act being expired which rendered your forces subject to military discipline has made us with some impatience wait for the time of this present session of assembly for as from experience we are become very sensible that our vigilant and active enemy have usually made their horrid incursions early in the spring but a little time will remain to put our regiment into such a fitness as may be capable of defending our frontiers and acting offensively when supported by a renewal of the act and proper orders to execute in our future marches and we being now reminded that in a late virginia gazette a narrative was published under the title of the centinels no x wherein the   0 officers of our regiment were particularly charged with many immoral practises which gazette is dispersed throughout his majestys dominions and as the said unjust aspersions therein contained may obtain too easy credit—not being in a like public manner gainsaid or answered—we humbly entreat that you will kindly take into consideration—and agreeably to the hopes assured us by colo washington give us public testimony that in your esteem we have not deserved the obloquoy complained of we can not omit mentioning that notwithstanding our early entrance into the service of our country the many attacks and skirmishes had with several of the french parties and their indians wherein great slaughter on both sides hath been effected and when the approaching winter has necessitated regular troops to retreat into winter quarters the officers and soldiers of our regiment have been constantly and fully employed in building a new fort at winchester and by adding new works to fort cumberland thereby endeavouring to make it defensible likewise erecting other fortresses and transporting stores  provisions which have proved very laborious and fatiguing also the workmens wages too low and discouraging under this head we further take the humble liberty to remonstrate the little or no notice taken of our address at home setting forth the frequent trials of our loyalty courage and activity to do his majestys good  faithful service not without presuming we might be thought of and put on the honorable establishment among the many battalions raised and lately sent over to assist and strengthen our operations against the common enemy as we have on many occasions been convinced of your friendly thoughts and dispositions toward us which we shall desire no longer than our merit may claim so we with grateful hearts present ourselves and refer all our interest and concerns to your wisdom and judgment subscribing ourselves as we truly are your most faithful and obedient servants—          george washington    january      fort cumberland governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort cumberland    january      honble sir your letter of the   th ultimo came to hand the  th instant i wrote to your honor by capt spotswood who was charged with the care of the catawba indians as far as williamsburgh that i had sent colo stephen with a detachment to bring the mutineers on the branch to this place in irons they were secured before he got there and he has brought all but six who deserted from capt joshua lewiss company before he reached it we have held a general court martial on the ringleaders flogged several severely and have some under sentence of death the proceedings of the court i thought it needless to send or ask warrants for execution as we have no law to inflict punishments even of the smallest kind  i shall keep those criminals in irons and if possible under apprehensions of death until some favourable opportunity may countenance a reprieve we have as many men at work here preparing timber to strengthen the works as tools will supply but i wish i had been ordered to build a new fort altogether rather than attempt to repair the old one     your honor thinks mr walkers discontinuing was for want of countenance—i must beg leave to answer and i dare believe mr walker will do me the justice to declare that i have uniformly treated him with all the respect and complaisance in my power that i did not approve of his staying is certainly true i thought it was doing injustice to the service for him to be absent when his presence was requisite and mentioned this circumstance to him accordingly and since the subject hath been mentioned i beg leave to add that if your honor conceives mr walker has been at any trouble in laying in provision you have been exceedingly misinformed he left the service the last of june or  st of july and has never done a days duty since either in making contracts directing the purchases or concerning himself in any manner whatever with the business nay no more than a stranger woud do but either declined the service altogether at that time or intended to throw the principal burden of his office upon me had mr walker continued to discharge the duties of a commissary i never shoud have thought of any other as there is the greatest friendship between us the part i have acted with that gentleman i shoud have acted with my brother had he been in his place but to acquit myself of all suspicion of this sort i shall observe that there never was the least disagreement between mr walker and myself either in words or actions before he left the service which he did with my knowledge since which i have never seen him at this place     until he came up in december to settle his accompts nor did i hear from him in all that time but once when he informed me it was his intention to resign if your honor thinks it proper to send capt mcneill whom i also esteem a very sensible judicious officer home with the catawba indians you will please to send for him he must be at winchester by this time capt spotswood having had charge of them to williamsburgh only when i left winchester i gave directions about carrying on the works at fort cumberland with all possible dispatch but a letter from capt mercer which accompanied your honors informs me that they are at a loss in respect of the manner of making the ambrazures through the parapet although i gave directions in person before i came away on this head they propose a method that will spoil the whole work and as i could not make them sensible of my plan by instruction only when present i have little hope of accomplishing it by writing—consequently am reduced to a disagreeable dilemma i have directed the provision on the branch to be smoked if there are conveniences for doing it no more forts were evacuated than were requisite to reinforce this garrison with  00 men and to continue  00 at fort loudoun according to order the others are continued at their former posts as may be seen by the return of our strength which i have caused to be noted a return of the indians was sent in my last i am c     george washington march      to the earl of loudoun march      my lord the posture of affairs in this quarter is really melancholy and the prospect was rendered more gloomy while there appeared no hopes of amendment but from the presence of your lordship at this time in the dominion we conceive hopes of seeing these threatening clouds dispelled the sums of money my lord which have been granted by this colony to carry on war have been very considerable and to reflect to what little purpose is matter of great concern and will seem surprising to those who are not acquainted with the causes and the confusion with which all our affairs have hitherto been conducted owing to our having no fixed object or pursuing any regular system or plan of operation as i have studied with attention and care the nature of the service in which we are engaged have been engaged therein from the beginning of the present broils and have been an eyewitness to all the movements and various proceedings i beg leave to offer a concise and candid account of our circumstances to your lordship from which many errors may be discovered that merit redress in a very high degree it was not until it was too late we discovered that the french were on the ohio or rather that we could be persuaded they came there with a design to invade his majestys dominions nay after     i was sent out in december      and brought undoubted testimony even from themselves of their avowed design it was yet thought a fiction and a scheme to promote the interest of a private company even by some who had a share in the government these unfavorable surmises caused great delay in raising the first men and money and gave the active enemy time to take possession of the fork of ohio which they now call duquesne before we were in sufficient strength to advance thither which has been the chief source of all our past and present misfortunes for by this means the french getting between us and our indian allies they fixed those in their interests who were wavering and obliged the others to neutrality till the unhappy defeat of his late excellency general braddock the troops under colonel dunbar going into quarters in july and the inactivity of the neighbouring colonies and the incapacity of this conspired to give the french great room to exult and the indians little reason to expect a vigorous offensive war on our side and induced the other which promised the greatest show of protection this is an undeniable fact and that all of the indians did not forsake the english interest till three months after the battle of monongahela but actually waited to see what measures would be concerted to regain our losses and afford them the protection we had but too liberally promised virginia it is true was not inactive all this time on the contrary voted a handsome supply for raising     men to carry on the war or more properly to defend herself matters being reduced to this extremity for want of assistance but even in this she signally failed arising i apprehend from the following causes the men first levied to repel the enemy marched for ohio the beginning of april      without tents without clothes in short without any conveniences to shelter them in that remarkably cold and wet season from the inclemency of the weather or to make the service tolerably agreeable in this state did they notwithstanding continue till the battle of the meadows in july following never receiving in all that space any subsistence and were very often under the greatest straits and difficulties for want of provisions these things were productive of great murmurings and discontent and rendered the service so distasteful to the men that not being paid immediately upon coming in they thought themselves bubbled and that no reward for their services was ever intended this caused great desertion and the deserters spreading over the country recounting their sufferings and want of pay which rags and poverty sufficiently testified fixed in the mind of the populace such horrid impressions of the hardships they had encountered that no arguments could remove these prejudices or facilitate the recruiting service this put the assembly upon enacting a law to impress vagrants which added to our difficulties for compelling these abandoned miscreants into the     service they embraced every opportunity to effect their escape gave a loose to their vicious principles and invented the most unheardof stories to palliate desertion and gain compassion in which they not only succeeded but obtained protection also so that it was next to impossible after this to apprehend deserters while the civil officers rather connived at their escape than aided in securing them thus were affairs situated when we were ordered in september      to recruit our force to twelve hundred men t is easy therefore to conceive under these circumstances why we did not fulfil the order especially when the officers were not sufficiently allowed for this arduous task we continued however using our endeavours until march following without much success the assembly meeting about that time came to a resolution of augmenting our numbers to fifteen hundred men by drafting the militia who were to continue in the service until december only and by a clause in the act exempting all those who should pay ten pounds our numbers were very little increased one part of the people paying that sum and many of the poorer sort absconding this was not the only pernicious clause for the funds arising from these forfeitures were thrown into the treasury whereas had they been deposited in proper hands for recruiting the money might have turned to good account but a greater grievance than either of these was restraining the forces from marching out of the colony or acting offensively and ordering them to     build forts and garrison them along our frontiers of more than three hundred miles in extent how equal they or any like number are to the task and how repugnant a defensive plan is to the true interest and welfare of the colony i submit to any judge to determine who will consider the following particulars first that erecting forts at greater distances than fifteen or eighteen miles or a days march asunder and garrisoning them with less than eighty or a hundred men is not answering the intention because if they are at a greater distance from each other it is inconvenient for the soldiers to scout between and it gives the enemy full scope to make their incursions without being discovered until they have fallen on the inhabitants and committed a ravage and after they are discovered the time required in assembling troops from forts more distant prevents a pursuit being made in time and allows the enemy to escape without danger into a country so mountainous and full of swamps and hollow ways covered with woods then to garrison them with less than eighty or a hundred men the number is too small to afford detachments but what are very liable to be cut off by the enemy whose numbers in this close country can scarcely be known till they are proved indian parties are generally intermixed with some frenchmen and are so dexterous at skulking that their spies lying about these small forts for some days and taking a prisoner make certain discoveries of the strength of the garrison and then upon observing a scouting party coming out will first cut it off and     afterwards attempt the fort instances of this have lately happened secondly our frontiers are of such extent that if the enemy were to make a formidable attack on one side before the troops on the other could get to their assistance they might overrun the country and it is not improbable if they had a design upon one part they would make a feint upon the other thirdly what it must cost the country to build these forts and to remove stores and provisions into them and fourthly and lastly where and when this expense will end for we may be assured if we do not endeavour to remove the cause we shall be as liable to the same incursions seven years hence as now indeed more so because if the french are allowed to possess those lands in peace they will have the entire command of the indians and grow stronger in their alliance while we by our defensive schemes and pusillanimous behaviour will exhaust our treasury reduce our strength and become the contempt of these savage nations who are every day enriching themselves with the plunder and spoils of our people it will evidently appear from the whole tenor of my conduct but more especially from reiterated representations how strongly i have urged the governor and assembly to pursue different measures and to convince them by all the reasonings i was capable of offering of the impossibility of covering so extensive a frontier from indian incursions without more force than virginia can maintain i have endeavoured   0 to demonstrate that it would require fewer men to remove the cause than to prevent the effects while the cause subsists this notwithstanding as i before observed was the measure adopted and the plan under which we have acted for eight months past with the disagreeable reflection of doing no essential service to our country nor gaining honor to ourselves or reputation to our regiment however under these disadvantageous restraints i must beg leave to say that the regiment has not been inactive on the contrary it has performed a vast deal of work and has been very alert in defending the people which will appear by observing that notwithstanding we are more contiguous to the french and their indian allies and more exposed to their frequent incursions than any of the neighbouring colonies we have not lost half the inhabitants which others have done but considerably more soldiers in their defence for in the course of this campaign since march i mean as we have had but one constant compaign and continued scene of action since we first entered the service our troops have been engaged in upwards of twenty skirmishes and we have had near a hundred men killed and wounded—from a small regiment dispersed over the country and acting upon the defensive as ours is by order this i conceive will not appear inconsiderable to those who are in the least degree acquainted with the nature of this service and the posture of our affairs however it may seem to chimneycorner politicians who are thirsting for news and expecting     by every express to hear in what manner fort duquesne was taken and the garrison led away captive by our small numbers altho we are restrained from making the attempt were our hopes of success ever so rational the next things i shall beg leave to mention are our military laws and regulations the first men raised if i rightly remember were under no law if any the military  law which was next of kin to it but under this we remained a short time and instilling notions into the soldiers who knew no better that they were governed by the articles of war we felt little inconveniences and the next campaign we were joined by the regulars and made subject to their laws after the regulars left us the assembly as i before mentioned passed an act in september following to raise twelve hundred men and in order i suppose to improve upon the act of parliament prepared a military code of their own but such a one as no military discipline could be preserved by while it existed this being represented by the most pressing and repeated remonstrances induced the assembly to pass a bill in october following for one year only making mutiny and desertion death but took no cognizance of many other crimes equally punishable by act of parliament so that no officer or soldier accused of cowardice holding correspondence with the enemy quitting a post or sleeping upon it and many other crimes of a capital dye or pernicious tendency could     be legally tried neither was there any provision made for quartering or billeting of soldiers impressing wagons c c but that which contributed the most towards rendering this law inconvenient and absurd and at the same time to demonstrate that the assembly fully intended to prevent any enterprise of their troops out of the colony was a clause forbidding any courtsmartial to sit out of it by which means all proceedings held at fort cumberland in maryland were illegal and we were obliged to remove to virginia for trial of offenders or act contrary to law and be open to prosecution how then were we to behave upon a march perhaps fifty eighty or a hundred miles distant these circumstances concurring to render the law ineffectual induced me again to recommend an amendment which i did with all the force and energy of argument i was master of but no regard has hitherto been paid to my remonstrances to what cause it is owing i know not unless to short sittings and hurry of business for i can conceive of no reason upon earth why the assembly should be against instituting rules for the regulation of their forces which long experience in established armies has fully evinced the necessity of but to cut short the account we are under no government at all to speak properly indeed there is a jumble of laws that have little meaning or design in them but to conspire to make the command intricate precarious in supporting authority and not to offend the civil powers who are tenacious of liberty and prone to censure and     condemn all proceedings not strictly lawful not considering what cases may arise to render them necessary another grievance which this act subjects us to is the method prescribed to pay for deserters many of our deserters are apprehended in maryland and pennsylvania and for the sake of reward are brought to the regiment instead thereof they receive certificate only that they are entitled to two hundred weight of tobacco this certificate is to be given into a court of claims they refer it to the assembly and there it may lie perhaps two or three years before it is paid this causes great dissatisfaction and the illdisposed to aid rather than prevent the escape of soldiers no regular provision is established for the maimed and wounded which is a discouraging reflection and grievously complained of the soldiers justly observe that the result of bravery is often a broken leg arm or incurable wound and when they are disabled and no longer fit for service they are discharged and reduced to the necessity of begging from door to door or perish thro indigence it is true no instance of this kind hath yet appeared on the contrary the assembly have dealt generously by those unfortunate soldiers who have met with this fate but then this provision is not established nor in any wise compulsory and a man may suffer in the interval of their sitting after giving this short and genuine account of our military laws and then observing that these laws are expired i conceive there need but few arguments to     prove the difficulty of keeping soldiers under proper discipline who know they are not legally punishable for the most atrocious crimes when this happens to be the case as it is ours at present how is it to be wondered at if mutiny desertion and all other irregularities should creep into the camp or garrison more especially if we consider that hard duty want of clothes and almost every necessary that renders a soldiers life comfortable and easy are strong incentives—and to go further when these in themselves intolerable grievances are set to view in the most glaring point of light by a person who lost to all sense of honor and virtue and building i am sorry to say upon a proclamation inviting the deserters from the virginia regiment to enlist into the royal american regiment hath made use of every artifice to represent the fatigues and hardships of this service and the ease and conveniences of the other to seduce them from their duty want of clothing may be esteemed another principal grievance which our soldiers have labored under in the first twelve months of their service they received no clothing but in march      they were presented each with a suit made of thin sleazy cloth without lining and flannel waistcoats of an inferior sort after that no others were sent for and two pence stoppages drawn from every mans pay recruits not excepted until repeated complaints and remonstrances from me enforced in june last by a representation of many gentlemen of the assembly who had formed an association and saw the disagreeable     situation of the soldiers induced the committee to whom those addresses were presented to send for clothing c these were to have been here by the middle of october but no advice is received of them yet which gives the soldiers some pretence to suspect they are deceived and it is owing to this irregular pay and the causes aforementioned that their late disobedience ought to be ascribed for i can truly say and confidently assert that no soldiers ever were under better command than these were before perhaps it may be asked by gentlemen not thoroughly acquainted with the nature of our service why the officers do not see that their mens pay is more properly applied in answer i must beg leave to observe that after the soldiers have appropriated a part for purchasing reasonable and fit necessaries the remainder is barely sufficient to keep them in shoes owing in the first place to the very great consumption the service occasions and in the next to the exorbitant price which this article bears i have known a soldier go upon command with a new pair of shoes which shoes perhaps have stood from seven shillings and sixpence to ten shillings and return back without any so much do they wear in wading creeks fording rivers clambering mountains covered with rocks c as great a grievance as any i have mentioned is yet unnoticed i e the militia under their present regulation a representation of this matter comes better and more properly from others yet my zeal for the service and my interest in the welfare of my     country have influenced me to touch slightly on some things relative to their conduct as i cannot enter deeply into the causes that produce them the difficulties and delays in collecting the militia in time of danger are so prejudicial that the enemy has every opportunity to plunder kill scalp and escape before they appear the want of orders regularity and obedience prevents any good effects which their assistance and force might otherwise have for every petty person must assume command direct and advise and must be caressed or otherwise takes huff thinks his wisdom and merit slighted and makes off in high indignation and contempt of the laws the expence of supporting them is make the best of it burthensome but where there are instances of a captain lieutenant and ensign going upon duty together with two or three sergeants and six or eight men at a time the disproportion of officers and men is so remarkable as to need no other proof of the injustice their waste of provisions is unaccountable following no method in serving a certain quota to each man mention a stated allowance and you offer an affront and they would rather starve than carry provisions on their backs as other soldiers do but heedless and prodigal they regale on the best without regarding expence or the oppression they spread to gratify their humor when they come into service it is with the utmost difficulty they are prevailed upon to take measures for     selfdefence much less for the protection of the inhabitants but indolent and careless and always unguarded are liable to be surprized by this means vosss fort was taken and the garrison destroyed and dickinsons was on the point of sharing the same fate to set forth all the reasons that can contribute to render the militia of little use and to point out all the causes which combine to make our service infinitely hard and disagreeable would swell these observations into a volume and require time and a more able pen than mine but there are yet some things that require to be spoken of—the illjudged economy that is shown in raising of men we are either insensible of danger till it breaks upon our heads or else thro mistaken notions of economy evade the expence till the blow is struck and then run into an extreme of raising militia these after an age as it were is spent in assembling them come up make a noise for a time oppress the inhabitants and then return leaving the frontiers unguarded as before and this plan is pursued notwithstanding former experience convinces us if reason did not that the french and indians are watching their opportunity when we are lulled into fatal security unprepared to resist an attack to muster their forces to invade the country and by ravaging one part terrify another and then retreat when our militia assemble repeating the stroke as soon as they are dispersed sending down parties in the intermedium to discover our motions procure intelligence and sometimes to     divert our troops such an invasion we may expect in march if measures to prevent it are neglected as they hitherto have been the want of tools occasions insurmountable difficulties in carrying on our works either offensive or defensive cartridgepaper is an article not to be met with in virginia and now before i sum up the whole i must beg leave to add my unwearied endeavours are inadequately rewarded the orders i receive are full of ambiguity i am left like a wanderer in a wilderness to proceed at hazard i am answerable for consequences and blamed without the privilege of defence this my lord i beg leave to declare to your lordship is at present my situation therefore it is not to be wondered at if under such peculiar circumstances i should be sickend in a service which promises so little of a soldiers reward i have long been satisfied of the impossibility of continuing in this service without loss of honor indeed i was fully convinced of it before i accepted the command the second time seeing the cloudy prospect that stood before me and did for this reason reject the offer until i was ashamed any longer to refuse not caring to expose my character to public censure but the solicitations of the country overcame my objections and induced me to accept it another reason of late has continued me in the service until now and that is the dawn of hope that arose when i heard your lordship was destined by his majesty for the important command of his armies     in america and appointed to the government of his dominion of virginia hence it was that i drew my hopes and fondly pronounced your lordship our patron altho i had not the honor to be known to your lordship your lordships name was familiar to my ear on account of the important services performed to his majesty in other parts of the world do not think my lord that i am going to flatter notwithstanding i have exalted sentiments of your lordships character and respect your rank it is not my intention to adulate my nature is open and honest and free from guile we have my lord ever since our defeat at the meadows and behaviour under his excellency general braddock been tantalized nay bid to expect most sanguinely a better establishment and have waited in tedious expectation of seeing this accomplished the assembly it is true have i believe done every thing in their power to bring this about first by soliciting his honor the lieutenantgovernor to address his majesty and next by addressing his majesty themselves in favor of their regiment what success these addresses have met with i am yet a stranger to with regard to myself i cannot forbear adding that had his excellency general braddock survived his unfortunate defeat i should have met with preferment agreeable to my wishes i had his promise to that purpose and i believe that gentleman was too sincere and generous to make unmeaning offers where no favors were asked general shirley was not   0 unkind in his promises but he has gone to england i do not know my lord in what light this short and disinterested relation may be received by your lordship but with the utmost candor and submission it is offered it contains no misrepresentations nor aggravated relation of facts nor unjust reflections virginia is a country young in war and till the breaking out of these disturbances has remained in the most profound and tranquil peace never studying war nor warfare it is not therefore to be imagined that she can fall into proper measures at once all that can be expected at her hands she cheerfully offers—the sinews of war—and these only want your lordships ability and experience to be properly applied and directed it is for this reason i have presumed to lay this information before your lordship that if there be any thing in it which appears worthy of redress and your lordship will condescend to point out the way it may be obtained and now my lord how to apologize to your lordship for assuming a freedom which must at any rate give you trouble i know not unless an affectionate zeal to serve my country steady attachment to her interests the honor of arms and crying grievances she is struggling under will plead an excuse till i am so happy as to have an opportunity of testifying in person how much i admire your lordships character and with what profound respect i have the honor to be c      george washington    april      fort loudoun richard washington to richard washington merchant london fort loudoun    april      dear sir after so long silence it may be expected i should introduce this letter with an apology for my seeming neglect it is necessary to urge something in my defence i own sir that i may satisfy you it proceeds from a very different cause than the want of inclination and what can be so proper as the truth i have been posted then for twenty months past upon our cold and barren frontiers to perform i think i may say impossibilities that is to protect from the cruel incursions of a crafty savage enemy a line of inhabitants of more than three hundred     and fifty miles in extent with a force inadequate to the task by this means i am become in a manner an exile and seldom informed of those opportunities which i might otherwise embrace of corresponding with my friends experience has convinced every thinking man in this colony that we must bid adieu to peace and safety whilst the french are allowed to possess the ohio and to practise their hellish arts among the numerous tribes of indian nations that inhabit those regions they are also convinced that it must be attended with an expense infinitely greater to defend our possessions as they ought to be defended against the skulking enemy than to remove the cause of our groundless fears in the reduction of the place fort duquesne i mean yet from what strange causes i know not no attempt this season will be made i fear to destroy this hold of barbarians for they deserve no better name who have become a terror to three populous colonies virginia may justly say that she was always willing to furnish her full proportion of men and money for this desirable end and i think i can venture to affirm that there never was and verily i believe never will be a more favorable time than the present for an enterprise of this kind while the enemys troops are doubtless drawn off to the northward to defend themselves at home against the more formidable attacks of lord loudoun i have now to add that i am so little acquainted with the business relative to my private affairs that     i can scarce give you any information concerning it i know that i ought to have some tobacco and that it ought to be shipped i have begged the favor of colo carlyle on potomack and fielding lewis esqr on rappahannock to do this for me and i desired them to write you in my behalf and draw for sundry things which i am in want of but whether any part or all of this is done i know not i shall therefore desire these two things of you first that you may put yourself to no real inconvenience in providing goods to a greater amount than my remittances will fetch because i by no means intended to be troublesome when i solicited your correspondence and secondly that whatever goods you may send me where the prices are not absolutely limited you will let them be fashionable neat and good in their several kinds enclosed is a list of sundries which i should be glad to receive agreeably to those directions i am c george washington    april      fort cumberland governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort cumberland    april      honble sir your letter by express of the  th instant i fear has fallen into the hands of the common enemy for i never have seen it the other of the  th i this day received and being exceedingly embarrassed to come to your honors intentions and really at a loss to know in what manner to act in such perplexed and difficult circumstances i called a council of officers     to my aid the result of their advice you will find in the enclosed  it will not be in my power to be in williamsburg by the   d as your honor desires but as soon after as i can i certainly will i shall leave orders with colonel stephen to march this garrison to fort loudoun as soon as it is relieved which cannot be before this express may return and then your honors further orders may be received we have no advice of dagworthys marching tho orders were sent to him i shall order all the countrys stores to be carried     to fort loudoun and the two companies on pattersons creek to be posted on the branch to complete the number that was designed for that place i have ordered a particular return of the provisions to be made out and colonel stephen to take captain dagworthys receipt for the quantity left we have been at a good deal of unavoidable expense and trouble to furnish the indians with such things as they wanted some enemy indians killed two catawbas on thursday last at about one hundred and fifty yards from the fort and seventy from a sentry and made their escape tho pursued by other catawbas and near two hundred men  and the day before yesterday two soldiers were killed and a third taken prisoner as they were coming to this place from the fort below the rest of the party being ten in number with captain waggener among them made their escape the enclosed remonstrance i received just now and think it expedient to send it to your honor that you may know the temper and disposition of the troops as i expect to be with your honor in two or three days after the express i think it needless to add any thing but an apology for the incoherence of this letter the indians are all around teazing and perplexing me for one thing or another so that i scarce know what i write i have the honor c     george washington   th april      williamsburgh governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie williamsburgh friday morning   th april      honble sir i make use of this as a less troublesome the most effectual and i think most expeditious method of recommending certain matters relative to the regiment c to your honors notice and to begin the act of assembly which subjected the virginia troops to martial law is now expired and when in force was altogether ineffectual for the purpose it is i think quite obvious that we can prepare no law more fit than that provided by act of parliament as a military code for the government of our troops we now have and are likely to get a goodly number of indians i would therefore humbly recommend that a judicious person acquainted with their customs be appointed to the care of them to conduct them agreeably to your honors direction or to the orders which he may receive from the commanding officer—to make it his business to see that they are well supplied with provisions and commit no waste of them to provide them with such necessaries as they may stand in need of and are allowed by the country to keep regular accompts of all expenses occurring c it cannot be supposed that this duty which will fully employ to execute as it shoud be the time of any one person ought to fall upon the commanding officer whose other engagements will render it absolutely impossible for him to pay so much attention to it as the service requires and if they are     neglected the consequences will be bad the paying a person for this extraordinary duty will in the end be an advantage to the country a good many goods should be provided for this purpose and that immediately there are many masters of servants yet unpaid who are very anxious to receive their valuation i shoud be glad if there coud be a way pointed out to do it as the owners look to me for the money the choice of good men to complete the regiment is really a matter of great importance we received because necessity obliged us many drafts last year who were unfit for any sort of duty and who were rather an expense than service to the country the officers hearing that their numbers are to be reduced are very desirous of knowing who are to go out some other method to pay for deserters besides that prescribed by act of assembly is absolutely necessary it is also necessary that some expedient should be used to bring the commonalty acquainted with the consequences of harbouring and buying clothes and arms from deserters c not to confine the troops to our own frontiers and defensive measures only by this means we put it into the power of the enemy to use advantages as they offer last year we could not without transgressing the law move out of the colony paying soldiers in small bills is an intolerable grievance it woud add to the credit of the service and be a strong inducement for numbers to enlist—were     the assembly to make some regular provision for the maimed and wounded soldiers who shall be disabled in the country service it is an uncertain tedious and expensive way for each individual after he is rendered unfit to serve to come down and petition the assembly for subsistence the commissarys office has for a long time been under very bad direction thro mr walkers uncertainty of continuing it wants much to be regulated the garrison which by the council at philadelphia is to be fixed at enochss plantation in order to secure a communication with fort cumberland—will be a manifest disadvantage to the country as it can answer no other purpose and will be attended with the ill consequence of leaving exposed the old road to fort cumberland which also is the road to our settlers on the southbranch betwixt whom and the inhabitants about fort loudoun are not any persons living save those at the forts which we have built and garrisoned for securing the said communication were the men who are appointed to enochss divided and one part put at edwardss and the other which shoud be the largest at pearsalls it woud be of infinitely more service to virginia and still keep open a communication with fort cumberland but not in so direct a course nor could the road this way pass by the fort at cresaps when my opinion was asked concerning a place to build on between fort loudoun and that at cresaps i was obliged to say enochss because there was no other place more suitable than enochss on that road     and to that road i was confined but at the same time i mentioned the other road as answering the two ends of securing the communication with fort cumberland and the inhabitants of the branch and asked lord loudoun in a particular manner whether the troops were to be confined to the places specified his answer was no because says he that might defeat our intentions the places now fixed upon are only nominated as passes which appear to be of the most importance but the troops will be removed to this place or that as occasion may require—which was my motive for saying no more on the disadvantages that might arise from building a garrison at enochss a full and discretionary power being thereby left in the commanding officer to post them here or there as the good of the service and change of circumstances in his judgment might require i therefore beg leave to offer this matter to your honors consideration in time as it may and doubtless will be attended with very bad consequences to this colony to secure the direct road that leads to fort cumberland only and neglect the security of the other which is now become of much more comparative importance to the settlers i also beg leave to observe here that the fort at the upper tract notwithstanding it is more in the indian pass of the mountains is too high up since numbers of the inhabitants from those parts if i am rightly informed are lately down about harnesss and a place called buttermilkfort which renders it necessary to place the troops—or at least a   0 principal part of them there also to protect the inhabitants in sowing and gathering their crops c it is a hardship upon the regiment i think to be denied a chaplain establishing the militia upon a good footing is a matter of very great moment under this present regulation they are of very little service upon any emergency—and very expensive the rates of soldiers diet when marching thro the country or upon recruiting parties ought to be settled as also the bountymoney allowed the officers to recruit with in case the country compleats the regiment by enlistment the officers complain heavily of their losses in the recruiting service their allowance is much inferior to that of the british officers while their duty and fatigue are equally hard—if not more so i doubt not but your honor will when you settle with governor sharpe about the provisions at fort cumberland consider that the carriage of them up c should be added to the first cost—if we only receive the like quantity at fort loudoun the country will sustain a considerable loss as the carriage c is almost if not quite as much as the first cost of the provisions i have in the preceding pages mentioned every thing that occurs to me relative to the service in general—and must now beg leave to know as there are new regulations making in respect to the strength and establishment of the regiment upon what     terms your honor purposes to continue me and what may be my certain dependence the speaker informs me that the country committee have determined no longer to be concerned in disposing of the public money nor have any thing more to do with settling accompts c and that the house have committed or intend to commit the care of it to your honors management the speaker farther informs me that he has made your honor acquainted with the allowance the country have made me vizt  0 per day pay and two per cent commissions for examining settling and paying off accompts and that you seemed to think it high i flatter myself sir that your honor will not differ in opinion from the whole country in this particular for the committee first gave it and the assembly afterwards allowed it as a recompense for my services  the extraordinary trouble and confinement i shoud meet with in the prosecution of such complicated duties as the nature of this service woud oblige me to engage in i also hope that your honor will not after the repeated assurances given of your good inclination to better my command render it worse by taking away the only perquisite i have and the only thing that enables me to support the expence which unavoidably attends my table and removing about from place to place on our frontiers where every kind of necessaries is accompanied with incredible expence from the distresses which exist there      george washington  0 may      fort loudoun john robinson to john robinson speaker of the house of burgesses fort loudoun  0 may       dear sir we receive fresh proofs every day of the bad direction of our indian affairs it is not easy to tell what expenses have arisen on account of these indians how dissatisfied they are and how gloomy the prospect of pleasing them appears while we pursue our present system of management i therefore beg leave to propose a plan which i know is exactly agreeable to the french policy and which may if properly executed be a means of retrieving our lost credit with this people and prove of infinite advantage to the country the french sir have a proper person appointed to the direction of these affairs who makes it his sole business to study their dispositions and the art of pleasing them this person is invested with power to treat with and reward them for every piece of service and by timely     presents on suitable occasions obtain very great advantages there is always a store of goods committed to his care to answer these purposes and no other person is suffered to meddle with it by which means the whole business is thrown into one channel and it thereby becomes easy and regular whereas with us it is every bodys business and no ones to supply every person attempts to please and few succeed in it because one promises this and another that and few can perform any thing but are obliged to shuffle and put them off to get rid of their importunities hence they accuse us of perfidy and deceit i could recapitulate a great number of their reproachful complaints if i judged it necessary to confirm what i have already advanced but i believe sir you are convinced from what you have seen that there can be no deception in my story therefore i shall endeavor to remark with candor freedom and submission that unless some person is appointed to manage the indian affairs of this colony under the direction of the governor or the southern agent a vast expense and but little advantage will accrue from the coming of those indians among us and i know of no person so well qualified for an undertaking of this sort as the bearer captain gist  he has had extensive     dealings with the indians is in great esteem among them well acquainted with their manners and customs is indefatigable and patient—most excellent qualities indeed where indians are concerned and for his capacity honesty and zeal i dare venture to engage if he should be appointed to this duty or if this plan should take effect i dare say you will judge it advisable to send for a large assortment of those species of goods which are the most likely to carry on the abovementioned business  bullen a catawba warrior has been proposing a plan to captain gist for bringing in the creek and chickasaw  indians if such a scheme as this can be effected by the time we shall march for fort duquesne it would be a glorious undertaking and worthy the man i am c george washington  0 june      fort loudoun john robinson to john robinson fort loudoun  0 june      dear sir a person of a readier pen and having more time than myself might amuse you with the vicissitudes which have happened in the indian affairs since mr atkin came up i acknowledge my incompetency     and therefore shall only observe that the indians have been pleased and displeased oftener than they ought to have been and that they are gone off that party under warhatche  i mean in different ways and with far different views one company southwardly to their nation and another northwardly to treat with the pennsylvanians contrary to the sentiments of mr atkin who has i believe sent to forbid any conference to be held with them  major lewis is returned with part of the indians     that went out with him in consequence of their having taken only eight days provisions with them he was unable to prevail with those savages to take more one party of twenty with ten soldiers is gone towards fort duquesne under captain spotswood and another party of fifteen with five soldiers under lieutenant baker but they course towards logstown god send them success and a safe return i pray unless you will interest yourself in sending money to me to discharge the public debts i must inevitably suffer very considerably as the country people all think me pledged to them let what will happen they are grown very clamorous and will be more than ever incensed if there should come an inadequate sum and that sum be appropriated to the payment of the soldiers i am convinced it would give pleasure to the governor to hear that i was involved in trouble however undeservedly such are his dispositions toward me i should be glad to know whether capt mercer received any money from the public while he was down and if he did on what account if he did not i would be glad you would pay none until you hear further from me altho he may have drawn orders tis on the account of the public i desire this      george washington    june      fort loudoun colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix  fort loudoun    june      sir i have the pleasure to inform you that a scouting party consisting of   soldiers and    cherokee indians that were sent out the  0 ultimo towards the ohio under lieutenant baker returned the  th instant to fort cumberland with   scalps and a french officer prisoner having killed two other officers of the same party  mr baker met with this party vizt ten french three officers on the head of turtle creek twenty miles distance from fort duquesne the day after they had parted with  0 shawanese indians returning from the war and would have killed and made prisoners of them all had it not been for the death of the indian chief who being killed prevented his men from pursuing them the name of the officer taken according to his own account is velistre and of those killed lasosais and st oure all ensigns the commandant at duquesne and its dependencies is delignery a knight of the military order of st louis and captain of a company of detached troops from the marine this officer likewise says that the garrison at fort duquesne consists of six hundred french and two hundred indians i believe     he is a gasconian we sustained on our side the loss of the brave swallow warrior  and one other indian was wounded and brought in upon a bier near  00 miles by the party who had nothing to live upon for the four last days but wild onions mr atkin who is now here and i shall use our endeavours to have the french prisoner brought to this place captain spotswood with  0 soldiers and  0 indians who went out at the same time with but to a different place from lieut baker is not yet come in nor any news of him which makes me uneasy our assembly have granted a further sum of eighty thousand pounds for the service of the ensuing year and have agreed i believe to complete their regiment of this colony to   00 men besides three companies of rangers of  00 each our strength since the detachment to carolina has embarked is reduced to   0 rank and file only and these much weakened by the number of posts we hold governor dinwiddie is apprehensive that he shall not be able to provide arms for all these men and desired me to advise with you thereupon if it is not too troublesome i should be glad to be informed what proportion of batmen there is allowed to a company of   officers and  00 men in the royal american battalions or rather the allowance to each officer beginning with the colonel and how these batmen are clothed paid and victualled     and by whom whether the officers have any allowance made them for their servants and if the officers in garrison receive provisions as soldiers or an allowance in lieu of it and how much to each also if the officers in their battalions provide bathorses at their own expense or have their baggage transported at the kings whether any foragemoney is allowed them and what other allowances they have made to them should also be glad to know what proportion of women is allowed to a company  it is wrong i must confess sir to trouble you in this manner but i have particular reasons for asking these questions and getting them answered by authority and none unwarrantable duty and inclination equally induce me to communicate all remarkable occurrences to you and shall be punctual in doing so george washington    june      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun    june      honble sir this instant the enclosed letters came to my hands i have not lost a moments time in transmitting them   0 to you as i look upon the intelligence to be of the utmost importance if the enemy are coming down in such numbers and with such a train of artillery as we are bid to expect fort cumberland must inevitably fall into their hands as no timely efforts can be made to relieve the garrison i send you a copy of a council of war held upon this occasion the advice i intend to pursue and until i shall receive orders how to conduct myself it is morally certain that the next object which the french have in view is fort loudoun and that is yet in a very untenable posture they have no roads for carriages into any other province but thro this and there lies a quantity of stores here belonging to his majesty and to this colony very much exposed and unguarded i shall not take up your time with a tedious detail you will be a sufficient judge of the present situation of affairs from those circumstances already related i have written to the commanding officers of fairfax prince william and culpeper counties a copy of which letters i enclose your honor requesting them to march part of their militia to this place immediately that no time may be lost i shall you may be assured sir make the best defence i can if attacked i am c p s i have wrote to colonel stanwix an account of this affair and enclosed him copies of the letters and council of war      george washington  0 june      fort loudoun colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix fort loudoun  0 june       sir yours of the   th from the camp at carlisle i received about noon this day when i was examining in company with his majestys agent for indian affairs the french prisoner brought to this place by lieutenant baker and the cherokee indian a copy of this examination i herewith enclose you will find sir from the tenor of his answers that a large body of indians was hourly expected at fort duquesne and that altho there was not if his intelligence is to be literally credited and surely it is not a train of artillery fit for such an expedition yet this might have been brought by those three hundred men who arrived there after he left the place it is altogether evident if the indian accounts     may be relied on that the french are bringing howitzers with them for the easier reduction of the place if they should attack us for they say your guns are but muskets compared with those the french have with them theirs will admit a fawn in the muzzle while yours will not take in a mans fist to any person in the least degree acquainted with the mountainous country about our settlements it is clear that the french can bring artillery along no other road than that from fort duquesne to fort cumberland without spending immense time in mending one then i conceive the garrison at fort augusta has been very negligent and inactive not to discover the enemy sooner on the other hand we all know that a blazed path in the eyes of an indian is a large road for he does not distinguish between one track and another without a circumspect inquiry i e between a track which will admit of carriages and a road sufficient for them to march in these sir are only my own sentiments and i submit them to your better judgment for improvement we very well know that from fort duquesne to fort cumberland there is a plain road already made and bridges also i shall however continue to pursue every means in my power to gain the earliest and best intelligence i can of the approaches of the enemy and shall transmit it forthwith to you i have sent major lewis of the regiment fifty miles advanced from this with orders to keep out constant spies for intelligence and to lose no time in transmitting it to me     we have received nothing new from fort cumberland since the   th the indians who brought the first news imagine that some of spotswoods party are yet skulking after and watching for the motions of the enemy on the contrary i apprehend they are all cut off for a man who left fort cumberland the   th says that the woods appear to be quite alive with enemy indians who show themselves openly in the day this is unusual for them to do unless they are strong we work on this fort both night and day intending to make it tenable against the worst event mr croghan c write to you by this express and will no doubt be more explicit on indian affairs than i can pretend to be and to them i refer it would have given me great pleasure had you been pleased to signify your sentiments on the revolution having come to this place that i might act conformably with your orders george washington    june      colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix    june      sir since writing to you by express last night i have received a letter from capt dagworthy a copy of which i enclose and have had an opportunity of examining the indians who brought him the last intelligence myself they unanimously agree there is a large party of french and indians marched from fort duquesne but whether they are destined     against the frontiers of virginia maryland or pennsylvania or all of these is yet uncertain the enemy however are without carriages and by their track for the indians did not see more than a party of about  00 pursued them towards raystown this they would do whether they be coming to either of the above provinces without artillery it is the way they have used altogether of late in coming to and returning from us i return you my thanks sir for answering my queries as you took no notice of the arms i asked for by the governors order nb there was a great misapprehension between capt dagworthy and the indians that first came in they deny to me having said that there was a body of the enemy with wheelcarriages on their march to attack fort cumberland these indians were not within  0 miles of fort duquesne but nevertheless heard the discharge of the french artillery which they conceive was fired at the departure of a large body of troops from that place capt dagworthy might easily have misunderstood these people for want of a good interpreter      george washington    june      fort loudoun colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix fort loudoun    june      dear sir i have had the pleasure of receiving your two favors both of the   d instant we were reinforced upon the late alarm by one hundred and seventy militia from the adjacent counties one half of them unarmed and the whole without ammunition or provisions had you sir in consequence of captain beales  suggestions ordered me to reinforce fort cumberland with part of my regiment i should have given you proof of my willingness to obey your commands in a speedy compliance with them but since you are so kind as to leave it discretionary in me i freely confess that i cannot entertain any thoughts of parting with the few soldiers i have to strengthen a place that now seems to be in no actual danger nor can i help observing that i think it a little odd captain beale after having received subsequent notice of the first should intimate that it was reasonable to reinforce fort cumberland at the expense of virginia which has a frontier thirty times the extent of maryland to defend and that frontier left solely to the protection of her few regular troops      i would only ask capt beale which is most eligible the militia of maryland who were also in motion at the same time with those of virginia defending whatever stores that province might hold at ft frederick while the troops in that garrison should march to the other or for us to leave the valuable stores which are at this place belonging to his majesty and the colony in an unfinished fort to the uncertain defence of militia who would not be prevailed upon to give the least assistance towards the public works at this place and march a part of the only force which we can in any wise depend upon from a muchexposed part of the country in order to ease maryland if the expense of keeping her militia in arms is really the question capt beale can appear in no favorable point of light to me i flatter myself the expected attack of fort     augusta will prove more favorable than colonel weiser imagines for i have no conception that a road fit for the reception of carriages can be cut within ten miles of a fort without the garrison discovering it it was a careless mistake of my quarter master to send you  0  barrels of gun powder it is quite manifest to every person who has had an opportunity of experiencing the advantages of indian services that the friendship and assistance of the cherokees are well worth cultivating for my own part i think they are indispensably necessary in our present circumstances and am sorry to find such unseasonable delays in bringing them amongst us since captain croghan left this place outassity  an indian warrior of that nation with twentyseven followers has arrived here he brings an account of many more that are coming but whether they will wait for mr atkins passport or will come on with their own i know not i have just received a letter from governor dinwiddie in which he desires me to present his compliments to you i am c      george washington    july      governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie    july      honble sir i had just closed mine yesterday and was going to send off jenkins  with it when yours of the   th ultimo came to hand the deserters apprehended at maidstone were treated with such lenity as their subsequent behaviour convinces me was misplaced several of them having since deserted this infamous practice wherein such numbers of our men have by means of the villainy and illjudged compassion of the countrypeople who deem it a merit to assist deserters has been wonderfully successful and is now arrived at such a height that nothing can stop its scandalous progress but the severest punishments and most striking examples since mine of yesterday no less than    more of the draughts after having received their money and clothes deserted notwithstanding every precaution i coud suggest was taken to prevent it among others i had all the roads waylaid in the night—seven of those who went off last night took that road that happened to be blocked up mr hughes whom your honor was pleased to appoint adjutant and two soldiers took two of them after exchanging some shot and woud in all probability have taken them all had he not been disabled in the right hand  one of our soldiers shot thro the leg and it is believed one of the deserters was killed in the conflict     i must again earnestly request your honor will please to send me up a copy of the mutiny and desertion bill passed the last session of assembly  with blank warrants to execute the sentence of the courts martial without which i fear we will soon lose not only all the draughts but by their going off with impunity there is such a bad example as will render even the detention of the old soldiers impracticable as the pressing exigency of this unhappy juncture demands the utmost expedition in which the welfare of the colony is so nearly concerned i flatter myself your honor will not hesitate at sending me blankwarrants by a course of unerring experience i am convinced beyond any doubt that nothing but the most rigorous measures can have the least effect the inconceivable trouble those discontented turbulent fellows give us and the few officers that now remain here have greatly impeded the service and laid me under the necessity of appointing the three oldest volunteers vizt mess speake felt and wood ensigns which i hope your honor will approve of i am glad your honor does not think of the additional companies or rangers till the regiment is complete a short time has already demonstrated how justly founded your apprehensions on that head were as i now begin to despair of seeing the     0 companies that remain in the colony compleated—i am convinced every day will lessen our numbers till some sad examples are made of the deserters as the unhappy fate of poor capt spotswood seems now to be ascertained and made a vacant company in the regiment i beg leave to recommend capt mneill in the warmest manner to your honor for it not only from his undoubted title of seniority but from his great merit hard fate and long sufferings in his rank and pay should he be again superseded it cannot be imagined that a man of his spirit will be any longer detained in the service however prejudicial his leaving it may otherwise be to him and i must confess it would give me pain that we should lose a good officer thro the default of common justice your honor seems surprized at my returning     men in may and but     in june it is true there were several desertions in that interval but if your honor will take the trouble of looking at those two returns it will immediately remove your surprize that of may was of my total effectives and that of the   th of june was only of the number i then had fit for duty designed to shew your honor what i had actually fit for service at a time when we were threatened with the most imminent danger the reason of my being so urgent for the blank warrants is that i am persuaded that postponing the punishments ordered by the courtsmartial will not only diminish the terror of delinquents but encourage other of the soldiers to follow their base example     and would your honor think proper to issue your proclamation commanding all the officers civil and military to exert themselves in apprehending these deserters it woud probably have a good effect i have ordered a roll to be made out of the draughts that deserted since they were received at fredericksburg which i here enclose your honor that you have it advertised if you shall think it proper although my brothers affairs have been long in an unsettled state and i am nearly interested in having them properly adjusted and which cannot be done without my presence being one of the executors yet i did not purpose when i asked leave nor ever intended to be absent but at some favorable time when the service coud admit of it without any detriment in mine of the   th ultimo i enclosed your honor doctr rosss commissary for the maryland troops letter relating to the provisions at ft cumberland and desired your honors instructions on that head since which the enclosed on the same subject came to my hand as mr atkin will not agree to part with any of the dutch blankets which came up for the indians to replace those of the regiments which colo stephen injudiciously gave away i shall be at a great loss not having a blanket left and unless they can be sent up soon from williamsburgh i shoud be glad to receive orders to send for them to pennsylvania i am c     george washington    july      colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix    july      dear sir your obliging favor of the   th instant i received this morning it will seem odd to send you three letters under one cover and those so widely differing in their dates—but the truth only shall account for it mr atkin has told me day after day since the date of my first that his express would go off the next morning—as he would the preceding evening be able to finish his despatches to you this prevented my enquiring after any other conveyance and is the cause of the delay of my letters till now militia you will find sir will never answer your expectation—no dependence is to be placed upon them they are obstinate and perverse—they are often egged on by the officers who lead them to acts of disobedience and when they are ordered to certain posts for the security of stores or the protection of the inhabitants will on a sudden resolve to leave them and the united vigilance of their officers can not prevent them instances of the above nature i have now before me which put me to some difficulty no man i conceive was ever worse plagued than i have been with the draughts that were sent from the several counties in this government to complete its regiment out of  00 that were received at fredericksburgh and at this place     have deserted notwithstanding every precaution except absolute     confinement has been used to prevent this infamous practice i have used the most vigorous measures to apprehend those fellows who escaped from hence which amounted to about  0 and have succeeded so well that they are taken with the loss of one of their men and a soldier wounded i have a gallows near  0 feet high erected which has terrified the rest exceedingly and i am determined if i can be justified in the proceeding to hang two or three on it as an example to others an affair has happened at this place which may i apprehend be productive of very unhappy consequences it is this about   days ago came to this town from chota in the cherokee nation ten indians some of whom call themselves mingos tribe of the six nations others cherokees c but as they gave no good account of their intentions mr atkin suspected their loyalty and taking them for spies has caused them to be put in close confinement in which they now remain this procedure greatly alarmed and at the same time exasperated about    cherokees who were at this place and knew all the prisoners and has obliged mr atkin to send an express to the south branch to bring outassity down who now lies sick there to clear the matter up he is not yet arrived—nineteen indians and the officers i mentioned in my last marched from fort cumberland the  th instant for ft duquesne by their return i hope i shall receive some intelligence worth transmitting to you at present we are pretty peaceable     the philadelphia post which formerly came to this place being stopped prevents our hearing any foreign news but what are transmitted in the channel of friendly letters we greatly regret the loss of this post and woud gladly keep it up by private subscription from this to carlyle if it comes that length  george washington  0th july      governor sharpe to governor sharpe  0th july      sir i have undoubted intelligence that many deserters from the virginia regiment are gone to and are harbored and protected in several counties of your province especially baltimore county under the specious pretext of their unjust detention after the expiration of the time which the deserters i learn pretend was limited when they enlisted—and some in authority either from an ill placed compassion or from that spirit of opposition to the service which is too prevalent through the continent—have not only countenanced those deserters but made use of your excellencys name for that purpose as you may observe     by the enclosed a copy of the original is in my possession i am quite certain that no orders have been issued since i have been honored with the command of this regiment to enlist for any limited term and captn gist upon whom the deserters would fix this charge declares on his honor that he never mentioned limiting their time of service in any other way than this that they should be discharged at the conclusion of the war or expedition which might possibly be ended in   or   months—which could be deemed nothing more than one of those little subterfuges which from the disagreeable nature of the recruiting service has at some junctures been considered necessary though i must still think it would come with a better grace from a sergeant than a commissioned officer i am sure from your excellencys good sense experience and knowledge in military affairs that you have given no decision in this affair without a proper enquiry which coud not well be made without the attendance of those who recruited the deserters and that magistrates have from the report of the deserters afforded them this unjustifiable protection as this is the point of view in which it appears to me i have ordered ensign fell who assisted in recruiting them to wait on your excellency and request you woud be pleased to have the affair enquired into that if the allegations of the deserters be false you will please to give such orders as will enable me to have them apprehended and if they are     well grounded that i may have captn gists conduct for disobedience of orders enquired into i judge this step necessary to be taken previously to my laying the affair before the commander in chief therefore hope his excellency will forgive this trouble from him who has the honor of being with great respect c  general instructions to all the captains of companies   th july      gentlemen the principal end proposed in sending you to the post to which you are ordered is to protect the inhabitants of those parts and to keep them if possible easy and quiet i injoin it upon you therefore to use every means which you and your officers shall judge advisable to answer this salutary purpose—particularly by keeping out constant scouting parties who with diligence care and precaution are to range all those parts thro which the enemy make their inroads and when the enemy draw near the quarter you are in to exert your utmost efforts in preventing the inhabitants from suffering by giving them all the intelligence you can of their danger and by endeavouring to cover them by waylaying those defiles thro which the enemy are most likely to pass before they can penetrate into the inhabitants these parties are to consist of such numbers as the service may require and your circumstances with admit but in general i woud have a third part of your well men and an officer frequently if not always to command altho he may judge the party too small for his rank you are by no means to impress horses yourself or licence any person or persons under your command to do it—except in     cases of necessity and where the interest of the service indispensably requires it for expresses c and then you are to be careful in seeing that as soon as the service is performed they be immediately returned to their proper owners in good order paying the hire of them or else to give a certificate specifying for what service they were pressed and how long employed in it you are not to accommodate any indians that may happen to pass your way with horses unless it be upon extraordinary cases nor are you to hold any conferences with them upon business only on such points as relate to the service in which you are immediately engaged neither are you to attempt making treaties with them or to make them presents promises c or any liquor but in a very sparing manner if at any time or upon any occasion you shoud pay away money for contingent expences you are to take receipts for them ascertaining the sum  for what service paid and keep an exact accompt thereof in order to lay it before me or any other person whom the government may think proper to substitute—and all services done the public for which you do not pay ready money you are to give certificates setting forth the nature and causes thereof as aforesaid and all accompts relative to provisions you are to settle with the commissary or agents whom the governor shall appoint and all that relate to your own and companys pay with the paymaster you are to take care that only one pound of flour and the like quantity of meat be delivered to each man per day and that no more women draw provisions than in proportion as   to  00 men you must prevent any provisions issuing without a written order from yourself or the officer commanding in your absence—to have regular returns made out for that purpose—to cause all provisions to be exactly weighed c you are to use every imaginable precaution to prevent irregular suttling licentious swearing and all other unbecoming irregularities—and to neglect no pains or diligence in training your men when off duty to the true use and exercise of their arms and teaching them in all other respects the duties of their profession     be particularly careful in seeing that they take proper care of their clothes and accoutrements which you are to do by inspecting narrowly every saturday at least into their order  by furnishing and making stoppages from those who have lost sold or otherwise made away with or abused their things till full reparation is had that this piece of duty may be conducted with ease divide your men into as many squads as there are sergeants—and make it the duty of each sergeant who is to keep the roll of their necessaries for that purpose to see that the men of his squad have their clothes arms and accoutrements always together and in good order this method i recommend as an alleviation of but not an excuse for the officers to neglect this duty themselves i also desire that the greatest regularity may be constantly observed in relieving the guards the sentries and all other parts of ceremonious duty that the men may not by neglecting this contract bad habits but rather thro a strict observance become intimately acquainted with and knowing in their duty and as i woud have the whole regiment tho never so much divided at present pursue the same system of discipline even in the most minute punctilios you are to send an alert sergeant or corporal and two or three men fit for the drill to this place to be perfected therein who on their return are to instruct the rest of your command i recommend it to you likewise and in the strongest terms that you and the officers under your command do make yourselves master of the necessary salutes you are to give in an exact size and necessary role of your company and to see that no noncommissioned officer or soldier is ever provided with less than   good shirts two pair of good stockings and one pair of good shoes and that the initial letters of their names are marked upon their ammunition clothes and accoutrements which you must cause to be entered in a book kept for that purpose to prevent their swapping and changing their things you are also to be vastly careful in making them preserve their regimentals and to make them appear always neat and clean and soldierlike—especially when they are upon duty     you are to transmit me the most exact and regular returns made out once a month not only of the strength of and alterations in your company or command but also of the arms ammunition clothes and stores carefully examined by yourself to prevent such egregious mistakes as often happen thro the negligence of the officers in trusting to the sergeants as upon failure herein you may depend upon being relieved and tried for disobedience of orders you are also to hold me duly advised of all material occurences in your quarter you are not to give furloughs to more than one soldier at a time unless some particular cause requires it and then you are to insert the reasons and time of their absence at the foot of your return if they should not happen to be present at the time it is made shoud any of your men desert you are to use your utmost endeavours in having them apprehended and whatever expence you are at over and above what the country allows is to be deducted from the pay of such offending soldiers if they shoud happen to be taken each deserter is advertised at  0s reward and more when other aggravating circumstances accompany his desertion i expect you will take great pains to make your soldiers good marksmen by teaching them to shoot at targets i have been thus particular in my instructions to you because i expect the most punctual obedience will be paid to them being determined not to overlook neglects of duty in any—but to act with the utmost strictness agreeably to the instructions which i am honored with from the governor and therefore in order to enable you to support a proper command— i hereby require that you do put any officer under arrest whom you shall find negligent in his duty or misbehaving as a gentleman and either enquire into his conduct with your own officers in order to a further examination at this place or send him here at once for that purpose and i do hereby direct you to hold courts martial for trying and punishing noncommissioned officers and soldiers without which the former are not to be broke and after which by no means to be reinstated nor new ones appointed without my approbation in all other respects you are to govern yourselves   0 exactly agreeable to the articles of war and the rules and customs of the army permit me before i finish and now that the companies are formed for service and agreeable to order to recommend—and i do in the strongest manner i can to you and your officers—to devote some part of your leisure hours to the study of your profession a knowledge in which cannot be attained without application nor any merit or applause to be atchieved without a certain knowledge thereof discipline is the soul of an army—it makes small numbers formidable procures success to the weak and esteem to all and may in a peculiar manner to us who are in the way to be joined to regulars in a very short time and of distinguishing thro this means from other provincials you are to be at no expence in building or repairing old works without first apprizing me thereof because the money appropriated to that purpose is expended the safety and convenience of soldiers render it a duty upon them to repair the works and make lodgments for themselves i woud therefore have you observe this and act conformably to it george washington  0 july      fort loudoun colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix fort loudoun  0 july      dear sir my former letters would inform you how little share i had in confining the indians in the public jail at this place mr atkin in his majestys name applied to me as commanding officer for aid to secure these people which i thereupon did but not without first representing the consequences that might and in some measure really did happen this step was no sooner taken than the cherokees in town about twentytwo in number despatched a runner to inform their people that the english had fallen upon their brethren and desired that they the cherokees would stand     upon their defence another runner you are sensible went to carlisle to inform the warriors there of it who returned fully resolved to rescue the prisoners or die in the attempt the former they did and were so enraged with mr atkin that they would hold no conference with him the next day when he sent to desire it till they had first been with me for information i took great pains to convince them that it was a mistake and happily succeeded they readily agreed to send an indian with an express whom i might procure to their nation to prevent a massacre of all the traders and white people there which they looked upon as inevitable except timely measures were taken to prevent it out of the great number of drafts that have deserted from us we have been able to apprehend twentytwo of whom two were hanged on thursday last  the eight companies now remaining in virginia are completed to about eighty rank and file four commanding officers four sergeants and two drummers and are all marched to the several posts assigned them the commission which i have received from governor dinwiddie to hold general courtsmartial is very long and rather a repetition of the act i should be obliged if you would let me know whether this be right or not i took the liberty in a letter of the — to ask leave to be absent about twelve or fourteen days if circumstances in this quarter would     permit but having heard nothing from you since i am inclined to address you again on that head because the  st of august is the time appointed for the meeting of the executors of which i am one of an estate that i am much interested in a dividend of and have suffered much already by the unsettled state it has remained in this estate does not lie more than a days journey from this place so that i could return very quickly if occasion required it p s since writing the above i have received the enclosed from captn mckenzie captn waggener just before with upwards of  00 men had marched to the place he speaks of to strengthen the garrisons on the branch i have sent him orders to select a good company if the enemy still remain there and use his best endeavors to fall in with their encampment and i am certain he will neglect no means to accomplish it i have also advice from the southern frontiers of augusta county that the indians have appeared and done some mischief major lewis with a detachment of   0 men including a company of  0 already in those parts marched to occupy vosss and dickinsons forts and to repel the enemy if they still continued to commit depredations george washington    august      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun    august      sir your favor of the   th by mr boyd i have received the drafts from lunenburg are arrived to the number of sixteen which does not replace the     soldiers that have deserted since my last so prevalent is this infamous practice yet the drafts when they were divided among the eight companies in july completed them to eightysix rank and file and there remained over and above forty workmen which i detained at this place as mentioned in a former letter what the strength of the companies is just at this time i am no more able to say not knowing what casualties may have happened since than i am to send your honor a return of the regiment which is impossible to do till i get my returns from the several outposts and that i believe your honor must be sensible is difficult and precarious dispersed as the regiment is i have given express orders however that those returns shall be made to me as regularly as the nature of things will admit and i shall not be wanting in my duty to forward them nor shall i delay to send the companies sizerolls when they come to my hands and i have directed these last also to be made out and sent to me carefully examined the enclosed is a copy of a report made to me by two officers who were instructed to inspect into the state of the provisions at fort cumberland mr kennedy who was entrusted with the care of these provisions is now there repacking and pickling them and when he has finished i shall endeavour to do the best i can with them but despair of turning them to the least advantage a letter which i received a few days ago from captain waggener advises that the enemy appeared     upon the branch not far from his neighbourhood their numbers uncertain and killed men and captivated others without his being able to meet with them on sunday last a small party of five cherokees who came here a few days ago set out to war your honor having asked my opinion concerning recruiting i shall give it candidly as follows i believe unless we are permitted to enlist servants we should spend much time to little purpose in this service there is such a spirit of opposition prevailing in one sort of people and so little spirit of any kind in another i never thought in the most distant degree of recruiting for the additional companies till the others were complete nor should i have mentioned that but thinking it was required by act of assembly as your honor were pleased to leave to my discretion to punish or pardon the criminals i have resolved on the latter since i find example of so little weight and since those poor unhappy criminals have undergone no small pain of body and mind in a dark prison closely ironed i have filled up a commission for sergeant feint  and will send it to him by the first safe conveyance colonel stanwix i am told the truth of which i doubt is marched to the northward i have no account from him these four weeks mr boyd whom i have spoken to on the matter conceives there will be no money left for contingent     expenses when he has paid the troops i shall do as your honor directs with regard to escorting mr boyd to augusta and ordering officers to wait upon him at this place however inconvenient it prove to the service nothing remarkable has happened for which reason i have nothing particular to add i must beg leave however before i conclude to observe in justification of my own conduct that it is with pleasure i receive reproof when reproof is due because no person can be readier to accuse me than i am to acknowledge an error when i am guilty of one nor more desirous for atoning for a crime when i am sensible of having committed it but on the other hand it is with concern i remark that my best endeavors lose their reward and that my conduct although i have uniformly studied to make it as unexceptionable as i could does not appear to you in a favorable point of light  otherwise your honor would not have accused me of loose behaviour and remissness of duty in matters where i believe i have rather exceeded than fallen short of it this i think is evidently the case in speaking of indian affairs at all after being instructed in very express terms not to have any concern with or management of indian affairs this has caused me to forbear mentioning of indians     in any of my letters to your honor of late and to leave the misunderstanding which you speak of between mr atkin and the indians to the former to relate knowing that he maintained a correspondence with your honor on matters relative to his office but with regard to the accompts when he would have nothing to do with them and when i was hourly importuned for the payment and knew i had not the means to do it what could i do less than promise the people that i would recommend their cases to your honor in hopes that you would appoint a person in whom you could confide to take in and pay off their accompts as i always looked upon it as a duty distinct from mine and therefore was unwilling to intermeddle in the affair i really thought it unnecessary to say more than that the detachment destined for augusta was marched because your honor gave me a copy of the council held at philadelphia which directed one hundred and fifty men to be posted at dickinsons and one hundred at vosss which direction i observed and thought it would be sufficiently understood when i wrote as above i should have acknowledged the receipt of the arms had they come but they were not arrived when my last was wrote which obliged me to disarm the men that remained here in order to supply those who marched rather than detain them as i had sent wagons to falmouth to bring em from thence however if i have erred in these points i am sorry for it and shall endeavor for the future to be as particular     and satisfactory in my accounts of these things as possible i am c george washington    september      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun    september      sir your favor of the  d instant came safe to hand and jenkinss sickness has prevented my answering it sooner i apprehend that thirteen of the twentynine drafts from lunenburg have deserted as sixteen only have arrived here and i have no accounts of any more being upon the march your honor may observe by the enclosed list of deserters all of whom have left the regiment since the last return i sent and after having received too their clothes arms and bounty money how prevalent still is that infamous practice among the dastardly drafts especially at this garrison where i indulge them in every thing but idleness and in that i cannot the nature of the work requiring the contrary lenity so far from producing its desired effects rather emboldens them in these villainous undertakings one of those who were condemned to be hanged deserted immediately upon receiving his pardon in short they tire my patience and almost weary me to death the expense of pursuing them is very considerable and to suffer them to escape without aiming at pursuit is but giving up the point altho we have had but little success of late     the uncertain and difficult communication with the outposts must apologize for my not sending you a return of our strength for august for the second month will always be far advanced before i can get in the returns of the preceding as the latter must be first expired before the returns can be made out and then some of them are to come two hundred and fifty miles and great part of that distance thro an uninhabited country if special messengers are always sent with these returns it will be a pretty considerable expense i should therefore be glad if your honor would be pleased to direct whether they are to be sent to me by express or to embrace the best conveyance without in the one case as i before said there must be a constant expense and in the other great uncertainty by the enclosed for july your honor will see that our total strength amounted to six hundred and ninetynine but as there happened many changes and casualties in that month by reason of the drafts joining deserting and the companies not being properly formed this return will i apprehend appear confused and irregular our present strength i guess is about seven hundred major lewis did as he wrote your honor march from this place with about one hundred and forty men only but then captain woodward who also marched at the same time with his company from the south branch joined him at dickinsons which with the men under captain hog formed a body of something more than two hundred and fifty men agreeably to     the number appointed at philadelphia for the forts at dickinsons and vosss i am sorry i did not know it was necessary to give the name of each officer of the command but shall do it now and set them down as they are placed in companies major lewis lt bullet lt fleming ensn speake capt woodward lt dangerfield lt milner ensn sumner capt spotswood lt lomax lt crawford ensn starke the above are the officers belonging to three companies that went to augusta but your honor knows capt spotswood was absent mr milner was also absent and has been so at his fathers these ten months in a consumption as i am told and i have given sergeant a commission and appointed him to woodwards company in lieu of ensign sumner who is now to join capt mckenzies company as soon as i was informed that colo reid was to supply the troops in augusta with provisions i acquainted major lewis therewith as there is no addition made to the drafts no men recruited and our numbers daily diminishing by desertion i cannot see how you can expect that i should complete the companies that are now under  0 to  00 rank and file each as you mention in your letter i never expected nor ever desired that there should be an addition made to the number of those persons appointed to transact public business much less that there should be one to settle every little affair i only humbly proposed that as captain gist was empowered with your honors approbation to   0 manage the indian affairs here and as he is to be paid for that duty by this colony that he as a more proper person than myself should take in and adjust the accounts against the indians so often mentioned as it cannot reasonably be supposed that i who am stripped of the help i once was allowed and told that i should be freed from these things in consequence can turn my hands and my thoughts to such a multiplicity of business as naturally arises out of the variety of occurrences which are occasioned by our scattered and detached situation and the many extraneous concerns of the indians every person who sees how i am employed will readily testify that very little recreation falls to my lot nevertheless if it is your honors orders that i shall collect these accompts i will do it in the best manner i am able and that with cheerfulness but it will be some time ere it can be accomplished as i have turned them off once the indian chiefs before they departed for their nation warmly solicited me for some drums and as i had none but those belonging to the regiment which could not be spared i was obliged to promise them that i would acquaint your honor with their request that you might if you thought proper provide them against their return since my last the enemy returned to the branch where they killed four men wounded one captivated a man and woman and burned some grain notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the troops who are constantly scouting the people in that quarter are terribly affrighted by this last eruption and i fear can     hardly be prevented from evacuating that valuable settlement enclosed is a return of the deputy commissarys return and report of the state of the provisions at fort cumberland and my letter to doctr ross on that subject an answer to which i hourly expect i have heard from secondhand that they intend to make no allowance for the fish we left there saying they were the kings fish as they really were and therefore as much theirs as ours i should be glad to know your honors sentiments on this matter i apprehended they would claim the fish as a right and therefore when i left ft cumberland to attend the committee in the spring according to order directed colo stephen to have them removed which he neglected to do i have received from mr boyd notwithstanding his first declaration to me £ 00 which with what remains of the  000 shall be applied and accounted for as you direct i was obliged to detain £  0 out of the first sum which came up for the companies but can now refund it when your honor is pleased to order the vacancy which captain spotswood  occasions to be filled up in the name of captain mcneill there will be room for a lieutenant and then if you please to bestow it on mr fairfax  i should take it infinitely kind if you would oblige me so far as to send the commission     immediately from yourself to that gentleman  for altho i esteem him greatly on account of his father for whose memory and friendship i shall ever retain a most grateful sense yet making him lieutenant over many old ensigns will occasion great confusion in the corps and bring censure on me for the officers will readily conceive that my friendship and partiality for the family were the causes of it if mr fairfax would accept of an ensigncy the matter might pretty easily be accommodated the letter under cover to colonel fairfax is not yet come to hand i have heard nothing yet from colonel stanwix but soon shall as i wrote to him a few days ago and expect his answer robert holmes is among the deserters i send your honor a sizeroll of my own captains stewart and lewis companies the others were sent to me but being signed by the commanding officer only as is usual i was obliged to send back for the subalterns to sign also when these come in i shall forward them as we have not at this time either commissary or assistant here it is not in my power to send a return of the provisions with any tolerable exactness but i do not doubt that mr rutherford our acting commissary who is now down has satisfied your honor fully in this particular if he has not i will take care to do it in my next the monthly return for july mentioned in the     body of this letter as sent upon reexamination i find so unintelligible by reason of some mistakes in captns spotswoods and woodwards return that i am ashamed to sign it till the mistakes are rectified and for this end i have ordered those companies in a peremptory manner to be careful for the future or answer the contrary your honor in estimating our numbers at about  00 will be nearer the complement but if i may presume to advise the contractors should provide for companies of  00 each as it is supposed we shall complete to that number as fast as possible i doubt not your honor will see the necessity of making an agreement with the contractors for furnishing the indians with provisions otherwise they will take no concern in this matter as i conceive they are allowed so much for each soldier that shall be returned in which case indians are included if they were not no person would supply them on the same terms they do soldiers for indians eat and waste triple what the latter do i am c george washington    september      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun    september      honble sir a letter of the   d ultimo from captain peachy came to my hands the other day contents as follows here was inserted the letter  i should take it     infinitely kind if your honor would please to inform me whether a report of this nature was ever made to you and in that case who was the author of it it is evident from a variety of circumstances and especially from the change in your honors conduct towards me that some person as well inclined to detract but better skilled in the art of detraction than the author of the above stupid scandal has made free with my character for i cannot suppose that malice so absurd so barefaced so diametrically opposite to truth to common policy and in short to every thing but villainy as the above is could impress you with so ill an opinion of my honor and honesty if it be possible that colonel corbin—for my belief is staggered not being conscious of having given the least cause to any one much less to that gentleman to reflect so grossly i say if it be possible that colonel corbin could descend so low as     to be the propagator of this story he must either be vastly ignorant in the state of affairs in this county at that time or else he must suppose that the whole body of inhabitants had combined with me in executing the deceitful fraud or why did they almost to a man forsake their dwellings in the greatest terror and confusion so that while one half of them sought shelter in paltry forts of their own building the other fled to the adjacent counties for refuge numbers of them even to carolina from whence they have never returned these are facts well known but not better known than that these wretched people while they lay pent up in forts destitute of the common support of life having in their precipitate flight forgotten or were unable rather to secure any kind of necessaries did dispatch messengers of their own thinking i had not represented their miseries in the piteous manner they deserved with addresses to your honor and the assembly praying relief and did i ever send any alarming account without also sending the original papers or the copies which gave rise to it that i have foibles and perhaps many of them i shall not deny i should esteem myself as the world also would vain and empty were i to arrogate perfection knowledge in military matters is to be acquired by practice and experience only and if i have erred great allowance should be made for my errors for want of them unless these errors should appear to be willful and then i conceive it would be more     generous to charge me with my faults and let me stand or fall according to evidence than to stigmatize me behind my back it is uncertain in what light my services may have appeared to your honor but this i know and it is the highest consolation i am capable of feeling that no man that ever was employed in a public capacity has endeavoured to discharge the trust reposed in him with greater honesty and more zeal for the countrys interest than i have done and if there is any person living who can say with justice that i have offered any intentional wrong to the public i will cheerfully submit to the most ignominious punishment that an injured people ought to inflict on the other hand it is hard to have my character arraigned and my actions condemned without a hearing i must therefore again beg in more plain and in very earnest terms to know if colonel corbin has taken the liberty of representing my character to your honor with such ungentlemanly freedom as the letter implies your condescension herein will be acknowledged as a singular favor done your honors most obedient humble servant      george washington    september      fort loudoun captain william peachy to captain william peachy fort loudoun    september      dear sir your favor of the   d ultimo came to hand about four days ago in answer to that part which relates to colonel corbins gross and infamous reflections on my conduct last spring it will be needless i dare say to observe further at this time than that the liberty which he has been pleased to allow himself in sporting with my character is little else than a comic entertainment discovering at one view his passionate fondness for your friend his inviolable love of truth his unfathomable knowledge and the masterly strokes of his wisdom in displaying it these several talents he has i think exhibited in a most conspicuous manner to every person who was in the least degree acquainted with the situation of affairs in this country at that juncture the report of your false musters is equally absurd and may take credit as above you are heartily welcome to make use of any letter or letters which i may at any time have written to you for altho i keep no copies of epistles to my friends nor can remember the contents of all of them yet i am sensible that the narrations are just and that truth and honesty will appear in my writings     of which therefore i shall not be ashamed though criticism may censure my style i am c george washington    september      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun    september      sir enclosed is a copy of a letter which i received from captain mckenzie since my last the different parties i detached in quest of the enemy who committed the late depredations in this neighborhood are returned after having prosecuted the most probable measures and exerted their utmost efforts in vain in endeavoring to come up with and prevent the enemys escape nor is it in any degree surprising for when the vast extent of country the scattered and distant manner in which the inhabitants are settled the nature of the ground and disposition of the enemy we have to cope with are collectively considered it is next to impossible that any of our parties should ever see the enemy except when they possess such advantages as render their victory certain the inhabitants of this valuable and fertile valley are terrified beyond expression some have abandoned their plantations and many are packing up their most valuable effects in order to follow them another irruption into the heart of this settlement will i am afraid be of fatal consequence to it i was always persuaded and almost every day affords new matter for confirming me in the opinion that     the enemy can with the utmost facility render abortive every plan which can be concerted upon our present system of defence and that the only method of effectually defending such a vast extent of mountains covered with thick woods as our frontiers against such an enemy is by carrying the war into their country and i think i may without assuming uncommon penetration venture to affirm that unless an expedition is carried on against the ohio next spring this country will not be another year in our possession sickness and the different parties which the distressed situation of affairs here obliged me to detach from this garrison so greatly retard the works that finishing even the principal parts of them before the winter sets in will i am afraid prove impracticable i understand there are a mortar and a number of shells at williamsburg which would be of infinite service here tho of little or none where they are we have a quantity of round and grapeshot for sixpounders but no cannon to use them a few pieces of that size would be a great addition to our strength and as this is the only place we have were it finished where a stand could be made in case of any formidable attack i conceive nothing in our power should be omitted to make it as defensible as we can mr rutherford is not yet returned enclosed is a list of the killed and captured by the enemy when last down this is sent to fredericksburg in order to go by post   0 george washington  0 sept      mount vernon mary washington to mrs mary washington mount vernon  0 sept      honored madam— your letter by mr smith i received on my way to col fairfaxs  funeral in answer to that part relative to my brother charles marriage i shall observe that if there is no other objection than the one you mention it may soon be removed and that mrs thornton if she believes i am capable of taking these ungenerous advantages knows little of the principles which govern my conduct however i suppose mrs thornton is actuated by prudent motives and therefore would be safe—if she will get any instrument of writing drawn i will sign it provided it does not effect me in other respects than her daughters fortune if my brother dies under age  i have waited till now expecting the arrival of my negros cloaths from great britain but as the season is advancing and risks attending them i can no longer depend and therefore beg the favor of you to choose me about   0 yds osnabrigs  00 yds of cotton    pair plaid hose and as much thread as is recessary in mr lewis store if he has them if not in mr jacksons and send them up by john who comes down with a tumbler  for that purpose i set out this afternoon on my return to winchester i offer my love to charles and am honored madam c     george washington   october      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun   october       honble sir both your honors letters of the   th ultimo i received by jenkins as i cannot now send a proper monthly return of the regiment for want of the remarks of the officers at the outposts i enclose your honor an exact return however of our effective strength and how disposed of which will at present answer the end proposed equally well i likewise send you enclosed the return of provisions specifying the time they will serve i am informed the contractor is to lay in the provisions for the troops in newhampshire at this place that he is to have  d a man per diem for the whole he supplies and that he is not to pay those who must inevitably be employed in issuing out the provisions at the different garrisons this information i flatter myself is without foundation as it is beyond doubt that provisions could be purchased in hampshire where the troops are quartered for half of what the contractor has for laying them in here and that the amount of waggonage and other charges of transporting these provisions from hence to n hampshire will exceed the whole cost of the provisions if purchased there not to mention the great risque trouble of escorts c c the assistant commissaries must still be continued or some persons in their room who under the direction of a principal would have purchased the provisions     upon as good terms as any contractor besides the commissary used to act as wagonmaster supply the different garrisons with candle made from the tallow of the countrys beeves and do many things for the good of the service not to be expected from a contractor i shall take the earliest opportunity of communicating your honors intentions respecting the ranging company to captain hog who i am informed is lying ill in consequence of the bite of a snake at dickinsons fort and will i fear be unable to raise the men i am afraid the recruiting one hundred men will be found a very difficult task i am quite at a loss how to act as you did not inform me upon what terms they are to be levied and supported what bountymoney to allow what pay to engage the officers and men how clothed and supported what the officers pay and what kind of commissions the officers are to have mr robert rutherford late deputycommissary here says that he could raise the men in a shorter time than any other and from his universal acquaintance on the frontiers and the esteem the people in general have for him i am apt to believe he could raise them as soon as any people whatever if they should have the same bounty allowed by the assembly for recruits i shall want money for that purpose the £     s  d i received from colo fairfax of the countrys money i accounted with the committee for in april last enclosed is a copy of the last letter i received from colonel stanwix     the enemy continue their horrid devastations in this settlement enclosed is a letter from capt josha lewis immediately on receipt of capt lewis capt mcneill   subalterns   sergeants and  0 rank and file marched up to act in conjunction with captn lewis the day before captain lewis was attacked twenty cherokees headed by one of the principal warriors of that nation marched from hence to the south branch who with the troops under captains waggener and mckenzie will i hope secure that quarter so soon as captn mcneill returns i will order him up to his company to which i have by your orders appointed him as i have mr chew in room of mr fell when mr atkin went away from here he carried mr gist and the indian interpreter with him since several parties of cherokees have been here by which i and my officers were involved in inconceivable trouble as we had neither an interpreter nor right to hold conferences with them nothing to satisfy their demands of things of which they were in the greatest need nor liberty to procure them these warlike formidable people altho they seem to have a natural strong attachment to our interest will i am afraid be induced by such treatment to hearken to the pressing solicitations of the french who by the latest and best accounts copies of which i enclose are making them vastly advantageous offers the chief of the cherokee party who went last to the branch and is said to be a man of great weight     among that nation was so incensed against what he imagined neglect and contempt that had we not supplied him with a few necessaries without which he could not go to war he threatened to return fired with resentment to his nation in short i dread that by the present management of indian affairs we are losing our interest of those people the preservation of whose friendship is of the last importance to the colonies in general and this in particular i am sorry to acquaint your honor that hamilton the quartermaster hath misbehaved egregiously embezzling and disposing in a clandestine manner of some of the regimental stores and afterwards running away and carrying a man of the regiment with him he had leave to go to alexandria to order up some of the stores left there and managed his affairs with such cunning that he was gone too long to be pursued before he was suspected enclosed is a copy of the proceedings of the court of enquiry several things were found at many different houses and the magistrates did not behave consistently with their duty i do not know that i ever gave your honor cause to suspect me of ingratitude a crime i detest and would most carefully avoid if an open disinterested behavior carries offence i may have offended because i have all along laid it down as a maxim to represent facts freely and impartially but no more to others than i have to you sir if instances of my ungrateful behavior had been particularized i would have answered to them but i have long been convinced     that my actions and their motives have been maliciously aggravated as your honor proposes to leave the colony in november i should be glad of liberty to go down to williamsburg towards the last of this month or first of the next if nothing should intervene to settle some accounts with your honor and the committee which may not be done in so satisfactory a manner after you are gone  the last alarm occasioned a great many of the inhabitants in this county to go off whereupon vast numbers are still moving i fear that in a short time this very valuable valley will be in a great measure depopulated and what further steps to take and how to obviate so great a misfortune i am quite at a loss as i have hitherto neglected nothing in the compass of my power it is very evident that nothing but vigorous offensive measures next campaign can save the country at least all west of the blue ridge from inevitable desolation we are in great want of a quartermaster to take care of the stores and i really do not know of a fit person unless your honor will please to bestow it upon mr kennedy he acted sometimes as quartermastersergeant then as commissary and i believe     is better acquainted with the duty than any one we can get he bears a good character and is acquainted with figures the dunkard doctor gave me notice of his intentions to wait upon your honor again for his release  in a late letter transmitted an information of the french deserters who came from fort cumberland against them and think it my duty further to add that i firmly believe they are employed as spies and are useful to the french of this all the frontier inhabitants seem convinced and are so apprehensive of the consequences that it has caused numbers to remove and will cause a general terror among them if this person is suffered to return and the others to remain out there for which reason i should really be glad to receive orders to bring the others in tis better provided they do not assist the enemy to bring them in than to keep a whole country in perpetual terror on their account mr rutherford set about making his return the moment your honors letter came to hand and but this instant has finished it having everything to measure and weigh in order to be exact since writing the foregoing the express whom i sent to major lewis is come in and brings returns of those companies so that your honor will now receive proper monthly returns of our strength for july and august by which you will see that our total strength amounts to thirtytwo commissioned officers fortyeight noncommissioned and seven hundred and three rank and file whereof twenty     officers thirty noncommissioned and four hundred and sixtyfour rank and file are employed in this county and hampshire but there are always six women allowed to a company who draw provisions and the officers receive more or less according to their respective rank as your honor would see by the estimate i received from colonel stanwix and enclosed to you some time ago which must be allowed for in the calculation i have this instant received letters from captains waggener and mckenzie by express the first writes that two men were killed captured about   miles from his fort the other says that a cherokee party just as they were setting out to go to captn waggeners heard that pearis was at fort cumberland and marched to him george washington   october      fort loudoun colonel stanwix to colonel stanwix fort loudoun   october      dear sir i am favored with an opportunity by mr livingston to acknowledge the receipt of your agreeable favor of the   th ultimo and to inform you of a very extraordinary affair which has happened at this place namely the desertion of our quartermaster this infamous fellow as he has proved himself after having disposed in a clandestine manner of many of our regimental stores being called upon to settle his accounts not that i or any officer in the regiment had the least suspicion of the scene of roguery he was     carrying on pretended that he could not come to an exact settlement without going to alexandria where some of the stores yet lay several of our soldiers deserting at the same time being the time when lt campbell called upon you he was sent in pursuit of them which for we had no doubt of his honest intentions afforded him the desired opportunity of making his escape he was ordered too to take alexandria in his return his villainy was not laid open before his departure and was at last accidentally discovered this person john hamilton had been several years a sergeant in one of his majestys regiments in which character he served three years under me during that time he gave such signal proofs of his bravery and good behavior as bound me in honor and gratitude to do something for him and i therefore got him promoted to be quartermaster as he was acquainted with the duty and capable i thought of discharging it we have had several visitations from the enemy and much mischief done since my last to you about the   th ultimo there were upwards of twenty persons killed only twelve miles from this garrison and notwithstanding i sent a strong detachment from hence to pursue them and ordered the passes of the mountains to be waylaid by commands from other places yet we were not able to meet with these savages on friday sennight a body of near or quite a hundred fell upon the inhabitants along the great road between this place and pennsylvania got fifteen more the mischief would have been much greater     had not an officer and twenty men of the regiment who were then out fallen in with and engaged the enemy finding however that his party was overpowered and like to be surrounded he retreated to a stockade not far distant in which they were besieged for three hours but the firing communicated an alarm from one habitation to another by which means most of the families were timely apprised of their danger and happily got safe off our party killed one indian whose scalp they obtained and wounded several others i exert every means in my power to protect a much distressed country but it is a task too arduous to think of defending a frontier as ours is of more than three hundred and fifty miles extent with only seven hundred men is vain and idle especially when that frontier lies more contiguous to the enemy than any other i am and have for a long time been fully convinced that if we continue to pursue a defensive plan the country must be inevitably lost   00 you will be kind enough sir to excuse the freedom with which i deliver my sentiments and believe me to be for i really am with unfeigned truth and regard your most obedient humble servant n b these constant alarms and perpetual movements of the soldiers of this garrison have almost put a stop to the progress of the public works at this place george washington  th october      governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie  th october      honble sir as i wrote to your honor fully by jenkins have little more to add than the affair hinted at in my last on the conduct of the magistrates here which from what i can collect appears to me to be of a most extraordinary nature and whose substance is or nearly as follows vizt— from the court of enquiry upon the quartermasters affairs and from the credit which the tippling house keepers with which winchester abounds gave to many of the soldiers we had reason strongly to suspect that some there had received and concealed some of the stores arms c belonging to the regiment and upon application justice speake issued his searchwarrants but thomas wood constable refused to execute them from various frivolous pretences nor was there one in the town who woud act even pro tempore so that affair must have been dropped had not mr alexander wood now a merchant here genteelly offered his service and executed  0  the warrants with indefatigable assiduity enclosed is a copy of his return the goods and the people at whose houses they were found were brought before mr speake who being a young justice desired the assistance of captn thomas swearingen one of the representatives of the county and a man of great weight among the meaner class of people and supposed by them to possess extensive knowledge mr john lindsay another justice likewise sat on this affair and after having examined the goods and people brought before them mr swearingen sagaciously determined that the affair must be further tried at court the other two justices readily coincided in opinion with him and accordingly without giving any other judgment or taking any security for the appearance of the delinquents tho many of them have few obligations to common fame for their character they dismissed them by telling them they must appear at the next court when that period arrived i ordered captn stewart to apply to mr gabriel jones for his advice and assistance as i conceived that procedure of the magistrates not only to be absurd and irregular but expressly illegal enclosed is a copy of what he did and advised taken in writing and signed by himself mr jones further advised me to transmit to your honor an account of the whole and observed that you no doubt woud direct the attorney general to prosecute the magistrates—as bringing a suit against them in this court woud not avail for this end i have taken every precaution i coud possibly  0  suggest to prevent the soldiers of this garrison from having any dealings whatever with the inhabitants of the town and have issued the strictest orders against their parting with any of their clothes arms c and moreover several severe examples have been made of those detected in the breach of those orders but from the all alluring temptations of liquor c many ventured to transgress and the fear of consequent punishment induced them to desert were it not too tedious i coud give your honor such instances of the villainous behavior of those tipplinghousekeepers as woud astonish any person but the little i have already said will suffice to convince your honor that it is impossible to maintain that discipline and do that service with a garrison thus corrupted by a set of people whose conduct looks like the effect of a combination to obstruct the service and frustrate the methods pointed out for their own preservation and when some of those practises were at length proved the laws made for the punishment of such gross offences trifled with by the magistrates in the manner the above fact and the enclosed will render conspicuous i could not believe did i not see it that these are the people of a country whose bowels are at this juncture torn by the most horrid devastations of the most cruel and barbarous enemy but enormities of this kind have got to such a height that nothing i fear but your honors interposition in ordering those magistrates to be brought  0  to justice and appointing others from whom more may be hoped can prevent the worst of consequences to a seemingly infatuated people the enemy did not so much mischief in their last irruption as was at first apprehended ten of those who were missing and supposed to be killed or captivated have since appeared the party of the regiment that was out with captain lewis suffered greatly in point of clothes and necessaries from the first intelligence captain lewis received of them he imagined the enemys numbers trifling and inconsiderable and in order to better his chance of coming up with them stripped and ordered his men to follow his example in that condition he soon overtook them but was obliged to make a very precipitate retreat—the enemy getting near the fort almost as soon as he did he has applied to me in behalf of his men to get them supplied out of the public stores for what they lost but as i had no directions in such case coud not let them have any thing altho i thought they deserved it they have likewise applied for the reward of the scalp they took—which i have sent your honor and hope they will by mr byrds return receive it which will greatly encourage them enclosed is a copy of doctr rosss letter respecting the provisions at fort cumberland i am sir c  0  george washington    october      governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie    october      honble sir your favour of the   th instant was delivered to me this evening the raising a company of rangers or augmenting our strength in some other manner is so far necessary that without it the remaining inhabitants of this once fertile and populous valley will scarcely be detained at their dwellings till the spring and if there is no expedition to the westward then—nor a force more considerable than virginia can support posted on our frontiers if we still adhere to our destructive defensive schemes there will not next campaign i dare affirm be one soul living on this side the blue ridge the ensuing autumn unless it be the troops in garrison and a few inhabitants of this town who may shelter themselves under the protection of this fort—this i know to be the immovable determination of all the settlers of this county which to give a more succinct account of than i coud in writing was the principal among many other reasons that induced me to ask leave to come down it was not to enjoy a party of pleasure i wanted leave of absence i have been indulged with few of those winter or summer i must here add that an incredible number of inhabitants has fled in consequence of the two last incursions of the enemy of which your honor has already been advertised and that i have taken indefatigable pains and found it no easy task to prevail on the bulk of the country  0  to wait the consultations of this winter and the event of this spring i do not know on whom this miserable and undone people are to rely for redress if the assembly are to give it to them it is time that measures were concerting if we are to seek it of the commanderinchief it is time our grievances were made known to him for as i before said another campaign such as was the last will depopulate this country then let the consequences be considered—where are we to get supplies of provisions for our armies when this valley which is the only support of them is entirely abandoned to an enemy which by that means will be entirely possessed of every thing necessary to pursue their conquest and that the adjacent counties will fly much faster than this not being half so well settled is a fact indisputable i shall also add what i did not in my last lest it shoud be thought i spoke from prejudice that captain hog is the most unfit person in the world to raise and command a company of rangers—he in the first place is generally disliked—were he not he has neither activity spirit or knowledge enough of the woods to answer this end and again the men most proper for such an undertaking would be backward to enlist under him fearing his discipline whereas i conceive a person in some degree upon a level with themselves woud have it in his power to engage for the good pay which is offered huntsmen who have been used to arms from their childhood and in a particular manner acquainted with the country from which many have been drove  0  these are my reasons against capt hog and in behalf of some such person as mr rutherford—to whom i have no particular attachment or desire to serve he refuses to accept of the second command i have expressed my sentiments upon this latter as well as the first affair with the utmost candor and sincerity in doing which i conceive i have done no more than my duty—the whole is submitted to your honors better judgment yesterday arrived here the indians spoken of in the enclosed copies of letters which came with them to me i purchased four horses bridles and saddles for £   and send them off today escorted by an officer who is charged with the care of conducting them thro this colony the cherokees that were on the branch are on their return to their nation having left this for that purpose several days ago they met about   miles beyond fort cumberland a party of indians under command of a french cadet whom they engaged the french cadet was killed and scalped—his orders found which captain dagworthy detained without even sending me a copy of them i understand however he was ordered to take a view of fort cumberland and then proceed into the inhabitants to kill captivate and lay waste the country mr kennedy i shall appoint in the place of mr hamilton i am c p s your honor has not mentioned what pay  0  the officers commissioned and noncommissiond are to have i coud settle the provisions in dispute at fort cumberland with doctor ross upon no other terms than these—he is to replace the flour and so much of the beef as the marylanders used at this place and to pay for the flour and beans—the remainder of the beef i must have transported to the branch george washington    october      fort loudoun john robinson to john robinson speaker of the house of burgesses fort loudoun    october      sir i applied to the governor for leave to come down in order to settle my accounts before he left the country and to represent the melancholy situation of our distressed frontiers which no written narrative can so well describe as a verbal account to a judicious person inclined to hear in a verbal account the questions resulting from one relation beget others till matters are perfectly understood whereas the most explicit writing will be found deficient but his honor was pleased to deny his leave thinking my request unreasonable and that i had some party of pleasure in view i have in a letter by this conveyance endeavored to set in as clear a point of light as i am able the situation of our frontiers and the disposition of the inhabitants to the governor and shall endeavor also in as succinct a manner as possible to make you sensible of both  0  in doing which it will be necessary to observe to you that the inhabitants of this fertile and once populous valley are now become our most western settlers save the few families that are forted on the branch that the enemy have in great measure ceased committing hostilities on the branch and fallen upon the people of this valley and that a considerable part of them have already removed this by persons unacquainted with the country and the enemy we have to deal with may be attributed to the cowardice of the inhabitants or inactivity of the soldiers but by others it will be imputed to neither no troops in the universe can guard against the cunning and wiles of indians no one can tell where they will fall till the mischief is done and then t is in vain to pursue the inhabitants see and are convinced of this which makes each family afraid of standing in the gap of danger and by retreating one behind another they depopulate the country and leave it to the enemy who subsist upon the plunder this sir is a matter of fact which you may depend on from me and further if we pursue a defensive plan next campaign there will not by the autumn be one soul living on this side of the blue ridge except the soldiers in garrison and such of the inhabitants as may seek shelter therein this sir i know to be the immovable determination of the people and believe me when i tell you that i have been at great pains before i could prevail on them to wait the consultations of this winter and the event of spring  0  i do not know on whom those miserable undone people are to rely for redress if the assembly are to give it to them it is time that measures at least were concerting and not when they should be going into execution as has always been the case if they are to seek it from the commanderinchief it is time our grievances were made known to him for i cannot forbear repeating again that while we pursue defensive measures we pursue inevitable ruin the loss of the country being the inevitable and fatal consequence there will be no end to our troubles while we follow this plan and every year will increase our expense this my dear mr speaker i urge not only as an officer but as a friend who has property in the country and is unwilling to lose it this it is also that makes me anxious for doing more than barely represent which is all that is expected of an officer commanding it is not possible for me to convey a just sense of the posture of our affairs it would be vanity to attempt it i therefore content myself with entreating you to use your influence to prevent such delays as we have hitherto met with if you think this affair depends upon the assembly if you think the assembly have done what they are able and that recourse must be had elsewhere i am determined as i will neither spare cost nor pains to apply to colonel stanwix who commands on this quarter with whom i am acquainted and from whom i have received several kind and affectionate letters for leave to wait on him with an account of our circumstances   0 through these means perhaps we may be able to draw a little of lord loudouns attention to the preservation of these colonies pray let me have your sentiments  in respect to these affairs i have not time to put my thoughts on these matters in a proper dress the bearer is in waiting and i am in other respects hurried but the truth of what i have asserted believe me is unquestionable as well as that i am with the most affectionate regards your most obedient servant and friend george washington   november      fort loudoun governor dinwiddie to governor dinwiddie fort loudoun   november      sir duty to my country and his majestys interest indispensably require that i again trouble your honor on the subject of indian affairs here which have been impeded and embarrassed by such a train of mismanagement as a continuance of which must inevitably produce melancholy consequences the sincere disposition the cherokees have betrayed to espouse our cause heartily has been demonstrated     beyond the most distant doubt and if rewarded in the manner in which that laudable and meritorious disposition entitles them to would in all human probability soon effect a favorable change in the present apparently desperate situation of this poor unhappy part of his majestys dominions but in the stead of meeting with that great encouragement which the essential services of that brave people undoubtedly merit several of them after having undergone the rudest toils and fatigues of an excessively long march destitute of the conveniences and almost necessaries of life and to give us still more convincing proofs of their strong attachment to our interest in that very situation went to war and in the way behaved nobly from which we have reaped a signal advantage and when they returned here with an enemys scalp baggage and other trophies of honor they must have gone home without any kind of reward or thanks or even provisions to support them on their march justly fired with the highest resentment for their maltreatment had not i and my officers strained a point procured them some things of which they were in absolute want and made it the object of our care in various respects to please them  another party of those indians since opportunely arrived to our assistance at the very juncture the enemy made an irruption into this settlement pursued     their tracks came up with three of them two of whom they scalped and wounded the third they are now returned from this pursuit and are nearly in the same situation with those abovementioned i applied to captain gist in their behalf and told him i must represent the matter to your honor but he assures me he has neither goods to reward them money to procure them or even an interpreter which totally incapacitates him for doing any kind of service if so which i have no reason to doubt it is surprising that any man should be entrusted with the negotiating such important affairs and not be possessed of the means to accomplish the undertaking by which he and several others who received high pay from virginia are not only rendered useless but our interests with those indians is at the brink of destruction whenever a party of them arrive here they immediately apply to me but i have neither any thing to give them nor any right to do it nor is there anybody to inform them to what these and their other disappointments are owing which reduces me to a dilemma as i would most gladly be extricated from i must likewise beg leave to mention to your honor once more the vast hardships many of the people groan under here having been so long kept out of the money that the country owes them on account of the indians when i proposed going down to williamsburg many of them brought their accounts to me which i intended had your honor given me liberty to lay before your honor i mention this circumstance     not with any view of being employed in examining and paying off those accounts which for many reasons i can by no means undertake but in hope that your honor will be pleased to give directions to and denominate some person for that purpose for the neglect of which so many poor people greatly suffer  i am c end of vol i   this is the earliest manuscript of washingtons that i have found except his studies in surveying and summaries of his reading and is

given to captain william trent an indian trader and friend and business partner of benjamin franklin while the other—raised in frederick and augusta counties—was given to washington having all things in readiness the instructions to washington read you are to use all expedition in proceeding to the fork of ohio with the men under command and there you are to finish and complete in the best manner

our settlements by any persons whatsoever you are to restrain all such offenders and in case of resistance to make prisoners of or kill and destroy them dinwiddie confidently expected assistance from the other colonies and notified the royal governors of what had been done the efforts of governor dinwiddie to arouse some enthusiasm in the neighboring colonies over the aggressions of the french were without avail the western country was almost unknown and no other colony felt the danger of the neighborhood of the french or even the violation of sovereignty which their movements implied the assembly of pennsylvania denied that the french encroachments and fortifications on the ohio were within his majestys dominions and the assembly of new york coolly told lieutenant governor de lancey

to protect the english on the mississippi but by insisting on the precedents of the canada expedition so clogged the bill with unreasonable regulations and encroachments on the prerogative that it was only through necessity that the governor gave his assent the assembly distrusting the governor retained control over the expenditure of the money by constituting a committee for the purpose composed

john page and john chiswell gentlemen or any nine of them vi hening     with this aid dinwiddie determined to raise a force of three hundred men divided into six companies and appointed colonel joshua

and one from north an error for south carolina to be marched against the french dinwiddie could call out the militia but was unable to march them outside of the province there was therefore an advantage in employing these independent companies which were paid by the king and were not subject to colonial regulations to encourage enlistments the governor issued a proclamation granting  00000 acres of land on the ohio free of quit rent for fifteen years to be divided among the officers and soldiers who should engage in the present expedition this grant involved virginia in a controversy with pennsylvania there being great doubt as to the boundaries of the provinces and consequently of the possession of the territory dinwiddie waived for the present the matter of quit rents allowing pennsylvania to collect them and it was not until august      that the controversy was determined joshua fry was born in england educated at oxford and came to virginia early in the eighteenth century

to their understandings will more and more dispose them to receive our baptism and unite in strict bonds of cordial friendship   mr washington had many of the indians with him but i observe these people remain unactive till they see how affairs go and generally speaking side with the conquerors that in my opinion little dependence is to be put in them—dinwiddie to hamilton july           there was a misunderstanding between the governor and the house of burgesses which prevented any appropriation of money at this juncture it had been a custom in former times that when the governor signed a patent for land he should receive a fee of a pistole about   0 for every such signature which was a perquisite of his office this fee had been revived by governor dinwiddie but the house of burgesses considered it an onerous exaction and determined to resist it as the governor refused to sign patents on any other terms the burgesses had the year before passed some spirited resolves and sent an agent to england with a petition to the kings council that this custom might be abolished the agent was peyton randolph then attorneygeneral of virginia and afterwards president of the first american congress while he was absent the governor wrote to a correspondent in england i have had a great deal of trouble and uneasiness from the factious disputes and violent heats of a most impudent troublesome party here in regard to that silly fee of a pistole they are very full of the success of their agent which i give small notice to the attorneygeneral returned without effecting his whole object but the board of trade made new regulations by which relief was afforded in certain cases and the fee was prohibited except where the quantity of land patented was more than one hundred acres—journal of the house of burgesses for november      the agents expenses were two thousand five hundred pounds the governor refused to sanction any bill for their payment piqued by this obstinacy the house of burgesses affixed the amount to a bill for raising twenty thousand pounds for his majestys service equally indignant at this presumption the governor sent back the bill without his signature and prorogued the assembly for six weeks thus no supplies were granted and the governor was induced to write that there appeared to him an infatuation in all the assemblies in this part of the world the treasurer of the colony had already paid the agent by order of the assembly without any special grant which was no doubt a high disrespect to the governor and council in giving an account of this affair to governor sharpe of maryland governor dinwiddie says i am now persuaded that no expedition can be conducted here with dependence on american assemblies and i have written to that purpose home and propose a british act of parliament to compel the subjects here to obedience to his majestys commands and to protect their property from the insults of the french   received in the action of fort necessity at the great meadows   probably william wright who was killed at braddocks defeat   when the assembly met in october they granted twenty thousand pounds for the public exigencies and the governor received from england ten thousand pounds sterling in specie with the promise of ten thousand more and two thousand firearms thereupon he resolved to enlarge the army to ten companies of one hundred men each and to reduce them all to independent companies by which there would be no officer in the virginia regiment above the rank of a captain this expedient he supposed would remedy the difficulty about command washington accordingly resigned as he would not accept a lower commission than the one he had held referring to the resignation thomas penn wrote i am concerned to find colonel washingtons conduct so imprudent—penn arch ii     meantime governor sharpe of maryland had received the kings commission as commanderinchief of all the forces engaged against the french colonel fitzhugh was to have the command of the army during general sharpes absence in visiting the military posts and in executing his official duties as governor knowing the value of colonel washingtons experience and reputation the commanderinchief wished to bring him back to the service and to effect this object colonel fitzhugh wrote him a letter in which he tried the force of argument and persuasion i am confident he observes that the general has a very great regard for you and will by every circumstance in his power make you very happy for my part i shall be extremely fond of you continuing in the service and would advise you by no means to quit it in regard to the independent companies they will in no shape interfere with you as you will hold your post during their continuance here and when the regiment is reduced will have a separate duty   that is the independent and colonial companies must always act separately and not in concert by detachments from each the inconvenience of this method was proved in the case of captain mackay previously to the battle of the great meadows colonel innes at wills creek contrived to keep up a nominal command by acting under two commissions his old one from the king received in the former war and his new one from governor dinwiddie to each of which he appealed as occasion required—sparks   there is no evidence of any unfair purpose in this matter of reducing the regiment and thereby throwing out the higher officers governor dinwiddie wrote to the earl of halifax on the   th of october as there have been some disputes between the regulars and the officers appointed by me i am now determined to reduce our regiment into independent companies so that from our forces there will be no other distinguished officer above a captain he afterwards asked that blank commissions be sent to him which would place the officers on an equality in this he could urge the carthagena expedition as a precedent   general braddock landed in virginia as commanderinchief of all the military forces in north america on the  0th of february the following order of the king dated at st jamess november   th      respecting the rank of colonial officers was brought out by general braddock all troops serving by commission signed by us or by our general commanding in chief in north america shall take rank before all troops which may serve by commission from any of the governors lieutenant or deputy governors or president for the time being and it is our further pleasure that the general and field officers of the provincial troops shall have no rank with the general and field officers who serve by commission from us but that all captains and other inferior officers of our forces who are or may be employed in north america are on all detachments courtsmartial and other duty wherein they may be joined with officers serving by commission from the governors lieutenant or deputy governors or president for the time being of the said provinces to command and take post of the said provincial officers of the like rank though the commissions of the said provincial officers of like rank should be of elder date since his resignation in october colonel washington had remained inactive at mount vernon general braddock knowing his value and the importance of securing his services to the expedition directed mr orme his aiddecamp to write to him the following letter proposing an expedient by which the chief obstacles would be removed robert orme   march      williamsburg williamsburg   march      sir the general having been informed that you expressed some desire to make the campaign but that you declined it upon some disagreeableness that you thought might arise from the regulation of command has ordered me to acquaint you that he will be very glad of your company in his family by which all inconveniences of that kind will be obviated i shall think myself very happy to form an acquaintance with a person so universally esteemed and shall use every opportunity of assuring you how much i am sir your most obedient servant robert orme aiddecamp   captain orme was now with the army at alexandria nine miles from mount vernon   in reply captain orme wrote the general orders me to give his compliments and to assure you his wishes are to make it agreeable to yourself and consistent with your affairs and therefore desires you will so settle your business at home as to join him at wills creek if more convenient for you and whenever you find it necessary to return he begs you will look upon yourself as entire master and judge what is proper to be done   speaker of the house of delegates and treasurer of the colony   chairman of the military committee   he instances among other things a very valuable and uncommon theodolite calculated not only for superficial measure but for taking of altitudes and other useful purposes which he expected to find useful in laying out fortifications   mount vernon is in fairfax county   soon after general braddock arrived in virginia he wrote march  0 to the governors of massachusetts new york maryland and pennsylvania requesting them to meet him at annapolis in maryland to concert measures for future operations the general commodore keppel and governor dinwiddie proceeded to annapolis but the place of meeting was afterwards changed to alexandria where they all assembled on the   th of april and concerted measures for the united action of the middle and northern colonies the minutes of this council are printed in documentary history of new york ii       the last of genl braddocks orders dated at alexandria were those of april    on the   st they were issued at frederick the march to wills creek that was outlined for colo dunbar was     miles in length he was to leave alexandria on the   th and reach wills creek on the  th of may the following was the movement of the advanced corps— april

outright and the other three are rendered unfit for use so that i have been detained here bullskin for three days already and how much longer i may continue to be so time can only discover   the selection of the route was due to st clair who thought to gain despatch by dividing the army sending one division with powder and ordnance by winchester and the other with military and hospital stores by frederick in maryland on reaching frederick colo dunbar found there was no road through maryland to fort cumberland and he was compelled to cross the potomac and take the winchester route st clair

escorted by   men of the militia of winchester to this camp which   men were two days assembling but i believe they would not have been more than as many seconds dispersing if i had been attacked to john a washington   june        the governors of the different colonies had promised much but performed little and the large deposits of supplies supposed to exist were soon found wanting or in places where they could be of no service and no means at hand to transport them to the army it was at one of these crises that franklin rendered such efficient aid writings ii     for two hundred miles the troops marched with only salt provisions and the general was forced to offer large rewards to such as would bring to the camp provisions paying a higher price than was usual for whatever could be obtained in one case some salted beef was condemned on its arrival in camp as unfit for food the horses were stolen almost as fast as they could be obtained the contractors failed to supply what they had contracted for and cresap lost his position as commissary through his gross negligence on the other hand gen braddock did not hesitate to enlist and take away servants and impress wagons horses teamsters and even carriages and carriage horses   these remarks are applied to the pennsylvanians who were singularly backward in rendering any aids for the public service the merit of procuring the wagons and horses here mentioned was wholly due to franklin and not to any agency or intention of the assembly being at that time postmastergeneral in the colonies he visited general braddock at frederic town for the purpose of maturing a plan for transmitting despatches between the general and the governors becoming acquainted with the obstacles which opposed the progress of the army he stipulated with general braddock to furnish within a given time one hundred and fifty wagons and a proportionable number of horses for which a specified sum was to be allowed he immediately returned to york and lancaster sent out an advertisement among the farmers and in two weeks all the wagons and horses were in readiness at wills creek he gave his personal security that the compensation agreed on should be duly paid according to contract   to mrs fairfax he wrote from fort cumberland on june  — when i had the pleasure to see you last you expressed a wish to be informed of my safe arrival at camp with the charge that was entrusted to my care but at the same time requested that it might be communicated in a letter to some friend of yours am i to consider the proposed mode of communication as a polite intimation of your wishes to withdraw your correspondence to a certain degree it has that appearance for i have not been honoured with a line from you since i parted with you at belvoir if this was your object in what manner shall i apologize for my present disobedience but on the contrary if it was the effect of your delicacy how easy is it to remove my suspicions enliven dull hours and make me happier than i am able to express by honouring me with the correspondence you had given me the hope of   from the   th of june to the  th of july washington was separated from the army

insurmountable obstacle unless some scheme can be fallen upon to retrench the wagons and increase the number of bathorses which is what i recommended at first and which i believe is now found to be the best means of transporting our provisions and stores to the ohio   on the   th the army was at spendelow camp on the   th it marched to martins plantation five miles from spendelow camp on the

remains of the english troops review of the military operations in north america dinwiddie wished dunbar to remain and make a new attempt on duquesne but a council of officers unanimously decided the scheme was impracticable and on the next day august  d began his march towards philadelphia   it is impossible to relate the different accounts that were given of our late unhappy engagement all of which tend greatly to the disadvantage of the poor deceased general who is censured on all hands—to orme    july        an estate left to him by his brother lawrence washington   he arrived at mount vernon on the   th of july he still retained the office of adjutant of the northern division of militia and immediately wrote to the county lieutenants ordering the militia to be ready and properly equipped in each county on certain days when he should be present to review and exercise them such was the alarm created by the success of the french at braddocks defeat that volunteer companies embodied themselves in different parts of virginia to march to the frontiers the reverend samuel davies at that time a clergyman in hanover county preached a sermon to one of these companies on the   th of august which was printed in philadelphia and london and entitled religion and patriotism the constituents of a good soldier after applauding the patriotic spirit and military ardor which had begun to manifest themselves the preacher adds— as a remarkable instance of this i may point out to the public that heroic youth colonel washington whom i cannot but hope providence has hitherto preserved in so signal a manner for some important service to his country   augustine washington was an elder brother by the fathers first marriage and was now at williamsburg as a member of the assembly   mr ludwell another of his friends in the assembly had written to him on the  th of august—i most heartily congratulate you on your safe return from so many dangers and fatigues and by this time i hope you are well enough recovered to give us the pleasure of seeing you here which all your friends are extremely desirous of the house has voted twelve hundred men but it is very probable they will determine at least for four thousand in conversation with the governor i said if this should be done i supposed his honor would give the command of them to colonel washington for i thought he deserved every thing his country could do for him the governor made reply much in your favor though i understand there is another warm solicitation for it if we could be so happy as to have you here at this time and it were known that you are willing to take such a command i believe it would greatly promote the success of our endeavours with the assembly   while colonel washington was writing this letter he had already been appointed to the command the assembly voted forty thousand pounds for the public service and the governor and council immediately resolved to increase the virginia regiment to sixteen companies in the same act the assembly also granted to george washington the sum of three hundred pounds to the captains seventyfive pounds each to the lieutenants and surgeon thirty pounds and to every soldier five pounds as a reward and compensation for their gallant behaviour and losses at the battle of the monongahela washingtons grant was for his losses sustained the governors commission and instructions to colonel washington as commanderinchief of the virginia forces are dated on the   th of august he was allowed all that is demanded in the above letter and also to appoint an aiddecamp and secretary the next officers in rank under him were lieutenantcolonel adam stephen and major andrew lewis i have granted commissions to raise sixteen companies to augment our forces to one thousand men and have incorporated them into a regiment the command thereof is given to colonel george washington who was one of general braddocks aidsdecamp and i think a man of great merit and resolution our officers are greatly dispirited for want of his majestys commissions that when they join the regulars they may have some rank and i am persuaded it would be of infinite service if his majesty would graciously please to honor them with his commissions the same as general shirleys and sir william pepperells regiments and i am convinced if general braddock had survived he would have recommended mr washington to the royal favor—dinwiddie to sir thomas robinson sept        as soon as colonel washington was informed of his appointment he repaired to williamsburg to consult with the governor respecting future operations when he wrote this letter he was on his return to winchester which place was fixed upon as his headquarters the two other points of rendezvous for the recruits were fredericksburg and alexandria i wish my dear charles it was more in my power than it is to answer the favorable opinion my friends have conceived of my military abilities let them not be deceived i am unequal to the task and do assure you that it requires more experience than i am master of to conduct an affair of the importance that this is now arisen to—washington to charles lewis    august        to the governor he wrote i greatly fear we shall also proceed slowly in recruiting it was attempted at the general muster in this county without success and the officers newly appointed began to express their apprehensions so soon as they had their commissions and to draft them will answer no end unless they are put under better regulations a proof of this is very flagrant in fredericksburgh where they were obliged to imprison the men who were afterwards rescued by their companions september           according to washingtons copy of his military orders and instructions the following were his movements at this time— after giving the necessary orders and collecting returns of the provisions clothing c at this place alexandria and stores at rock creek i continued to winchester where i arrived on the   th of september    from thence i continued to fort cumberland and took upon me the command of the troops there issuing the daily orders and giving such instructions and directions as appeared necessary    from thence i proceeded to fort dinwiddie on jacksons river he was there on the   th    after examining into the state of

williamsburgh    from hence i set out on the  th to williamsburgh     from hence i continued my journey to colonel baylors where i was overtaken by an express sent from colonel stephen informing that a body of indians had fallen on the inhabitants killed many of them destroyed and burnt several of their houses i hereupon wrote to the governor and returned immediately to fredericksburgh and wrote a second letter that printed on this page to the governor    at this place fredksbg i pressed horses and rode immediately to lord fairfaxs and winchester and finding everything in the utmost confusion and no certain accounts of the enemy i hired two scouts to go to the branch and endeavour to procure intelligence   of this the governor was convinced for immediately after the defeat of braddock he wrote to his superiors of his intention to press a military law without which little dependence could be placed in the militia in the august session a new regulation of militia was passed—hening vi   0   washington instructed gist to visit montour and use his personal influence in inducing him to bring indians into camp i will promise if he brings many to do something handsome for him you had better be silent on this head though least where you are measures may be taken by the pennsylvanians to prevent him from bringing any indians—to gist    oct        in the october session a mutiny bill

a month regularly further encouragement would be given did he bring more men the shawnees and delawares were in arms against the english and rumors were rife of french machinations among the southern tribes to major lewis he wrote when the indians arrive with captain montour or gist you are to see them properly provided with all necessaries and use your utmost endeavours to see them duly encouraged and the officers are all desired to take notice of them and treat them kindly as their assistance at this time is absolutely necessary montour was taken into the service and paid £   a year virginia money   to a captain he wrote—your late disobedience of orders has greatly displeased me it is impossible to carry on affairs as they ought to be when you pay so little regard to a military order you must be conscious that your crime is sufficient to break the best officer that ever bore a commission   he was now returning from williamsburg to headquarters at winchester having previously made a journey to fort cumberland   the old difficulty about rank between the provincial officers and those with kings commissions had been revived at fort cumberland immediately after the affair of the great meadows the assembly of maryland granted the small sum of six thousand pounds for the defence of the frontiers and in the december following they passed an act authorizing the governor to raise a military force a few soldiers only were enlisted and at this time a maryland company of thirty men was stationed at fort cumberland i have given the command thereof to one capt dagworthy a gentleman born in the jerseys who commanded a company raised in that province for the canada expedition since the miscarriage of which he has resided in this province upon an estate which he purchased in worcester county—gov sharpe to charles calvert   sept      governor innes had gone home to north carolina on his private affairs dagworthy assumed the command and refused to obey any orders of a provincial officer however high in rank this created wranglings and insubordination among the inferior officers who took sides the governor of maryland was tardy in giving any decisive orders to dagworthy because the fort was in that province and he seemed willing to consider it under his command governor dinwiddie argued that it was a kings fort built by an order sent to him from the king chiefly by forces in the kings pay and that it could in no sense be regarded as subject to the authority of maryland and moreover as captain dagworthy had commuted his halfpay for a specific sum of money his commission had thereby become obsolete and there was no propriety in his pretending to act under it and it was an absurdity for a captain with thirty men who in reality had no other commission than that from the governor of maryland to claim precedence of the commanderinchief of all the virginia forces colonel washington refused to interfere but made a forcible remonstrance to the governor and council at williamsburg and insisted on a speedy arrangement that should put an end to the difficulty to effect this purpose governor dinwiddie sent an express to general shirley commander of his majestys forces in north america stating the particulars of the case and requesting from him brevet commissions for colonel washington and the fieldofficers under him proposing at the same time that these commissions should only imply rank without giving any claim to pay from the king—dinwiddies letterbooks—laws of maryland      shirley asked sharpe to accommodate the dispute the governors troubles seemed to thicken at this crisis on the   th of november he wrote to the earl of halifax— our assembly met on the   th ultimo but not above one half of them gave their attendance they fell into cabals and wanted to emit two hundred thousand pounds in paper money for a loanoffice to be discharged in eight years which i thought to be contrary to act of parliament and my instructions they further proposed a secret committee which in course would have been the beginning of great dissensions they likewise were very mutinous and unmannerly for their not meeting in a body when summoned and for the above conduct i thought it for his majestys service and for the good of this dominion to dissolve them and take my chance of a new election which i think cannot be so bad as

determine a plan for future operations it was decided to fortify crown point and attack the french on ontario and to make an attempt against duquesne which it was thought would answer very good purposes especially in securing the fidelity of the western indians virginia was not represented   the warm contest between the governor and assembly of pennsylvania respecting the mode of raising money had hitherto prevented any efficient aid being rendered by that colony for the public service as the proprietaries owned large estates in the province the assembly insisted that these estates should be taxed for the common defence in the same proportion as the estates of the inhabitants and reported all their bills accordingly prohibited by his instructions the governor had no power to sanction such bills in a case so manifestly just and involving a principle of great importance the assembly would not yield and no money was granted at last when the news of braddocks defeat reached england the proprietaries alarmed at the progress of the enemy or as dr franklin has said intimidated by the clamor raised against them for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions ordered the receivergeneral to add five thousand pounds to such sums as the assembly should grant for the security of the province when this was made known to the house a new bill was framed granting sixty thousand pounds for the use of the crown with a clause exempting the proprietary estates from the tax—votes of the pennsylvania assembly for november      in the may preceding the assembly had given fifteen thousand pounds for the kings use by an order appropriating funds then within their control five thousand pounds of this money were applied to victualling the kings troops in virginia and ten thousand pounds to procuring and transporting provisions for the massachusetts troops engaged in the kings service at the same time that the above grant of sixty thousand pounds was made a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia was drafted by franklin which as he says passed through the house with little difficulty as the quakers were left at liberty several companies were organized but none ever joined the virginians in any expedition against the indians the money was chiefly expended in building forts on the pennsylvania frontiers under

no regular troops joined can only take rank as a provincial captain and of course is under the command of all provincial fieldofficers and in case it should happen that colonel washington and captain dagworthy should join at fort cumberland it is my order that colonel washington shall take the command w shirley as soon as he returned from this tour he proceeded onward to williamsburg he had been

the bowstrings of the enemy rather than attempt to drive them from her frontiers   the council of war determined that enochs fort should be abandoned and destroyed and that all of the garrison that could be spared from fort edwards should march to winchester   his orders for preserving discipline must be allowed to have been sufficiently rigid the following is a specimen— any commissioned

immediately reduced and receive corporal punishment any soldier who shall presume to quarrel or fight shall receive five hundred lashes without the benefit of a courtmartial the offender upon complaint made shall have strict justice done him any soldier found drunk shall receive one hundred lashes without benefit of a courtmartial to the major of his regiment he wrote on another occasion—your own good sense has sufficiently prompted you to study the nature of your duty but at the same time permit me as a duty incumbent on myself to recommend in the strongest terms to you the necessity of qualifying yourself by reading for the discharge of the duty of major a post which requires a thorough knowledge of the service and on the due execution of which your own credit as well as that of the regiment greatly depends   governor dinwiddie had formed a project of a much more extensive chain of forts embracing the whole line of frontier from crown point to the country of the creek indians this project he communicated to the board of trade on the   d of february a peculiar feature of this plan was that the expenses of erecting and supporting these forts should be provided for by a land and polltax to be levied by an act of parliament which should take effect equally throughout all the colonies he proposed a polltax of one shilling sterling for two years which he thought would be sufficient for building the forts and a perpetual landtax of two shillings on every hundred acres of land as a fund for keeping up the garrison i know he adds that our people will be inflamed if they hear of my making this proposal as they are averse to all taxes but in my duty and in obedience to your commands i cannot but think it the most eligible and it will remain as long as the land but if not done by an act of the british parliament i may venture to affirm that no governors on this continent will be able to prevail on the assemblies to pass laws for this purpose by his calculation there were at least a million of taxable polls in the colonies hence this tax would produce fifty thousand pounds a year and the landtax estimated by the quitrents paid in virginia he believed would yield annually sixty thousand pounds the population of virginia he considered at this time to be        of whom        were white and   0    black the militia were computed at   000 men

assembled at winchester upon the recent alarm had given the commander infinite trouble and anxiety on this subject colonel william fairfax wrote to him— i am sensible that such a medley of undisciplined militia must create you various troubles but having cæsars commentaries and perhaps quintus curtius you have therein read of greater fatigues murmurings mutinies and defections than will probably come to your share though if any of those casualties should interrupt your quiet i doubt not you would bear them with a magnanimity equal to that of any of the heroes of those times the council and burgesses are mostly your friends so that if you have not always particular instructions from the governor which you think necessary and desire the omission or neglect may proceed from the confidence entertained in your ability and discretion to do what is fit and praiseworthy   this company appears to have originated among the lawyers and the association was entered into on may  d on

attorney general peyton randolph at their head being volunteers serving at their own cost the governor gave them no orders they marched towards winchester but the alarm subsided before they had an opportunity of putting their martial spirit to the test mr robinson the speaker after giving notice to colonel washington of the organization of this company of gentlemen volunteers added—the council

our affairs to a happy issue the governor wrote as follows to majorgeneral abercrombie may   th as we are told the earl of loudoun is to raise three regiments on this continent on the british establishment i dearnt venture to trouble him immediately on his arrival with any recommendations but good sir give me leave to pray your interest with his lordship in favor of colonel george washington who i will venture to say is a very deserving gentleman and has from the beginning commanded the forces of this dominion general braddock had so high an esteem for his merit that he made him one of his aiddecamps and if he had survived i believe he would have provided handsomely for him in the regulars he is a person much beloved here and he has gone through many hardships in the service and i really think he has great merit and believe he can raise more men here than any one present that i know if his lordship will be so kind as to promote him in the british establishment i think he will answer my recommendation   this fort built at winchester was called fort loudoun   the assembly have resolved that their troops shall not march out of the colony whether this is binding on the whole or only the drafts i know not and therefore i would not advise your going into maryland unless it be to procure some manifest advantage to virginia in keeping the enemy out of it c to range for and search them in another province i cannot think consistent with the intention of the assembly nor is it the design of the assembly or governor as the men are raised solely for the defence of the colony and not acting in conjunction with other corps that governor sharpe or his officers shoud have any connection with them you are therefore to pay no regard to any orders that you may receive from him or any other than the governor of virginia myself or your superior officers in the virginia regiment—to captain robert stewart   june        if the six quakers will not fight you must compel them to work on the forts to carry timber c if they will not do so confine them with a short allowance of bread and water till you bring them to reason—dinwiddie to washington june        on the same day he wrote the governor—i was in hope that by garrisoning the forts with part of the militia we should have been able to have mustered a greater number of soldiers to work upon the forts that are to be built but i am under the greatest apprehensions that all who are now up will desert they go off in twenties and all threaten to return if they are not relieved in a very short time or discharged    if they should go as i suppose they will we shall again be much exposed to all excursions and cannot defend so extensive a frontier the governor replied i am really ashamed of the dastardly pusillanimous spirits of the people in general in this time of danger and we must depend much more on the protection of heaven than the second means expected from us by god   the governor and assembly of maryland had come at last to a temporary reconciliation of their differences so far as to agree in a bill for raising forty thousand pounds for his majestys service of this sum eleven thousand pounds were to be appropriated to building a fort on the frontiers near but not beyond the north mountain and twentyfive thousand for carrying on any expedition for the public service in which the other colonies might join by the same act the governor was authorized to raise two hundred men to be employed in constructing the fort—acts of assembly passed in may     —mcmahons history of

thing as he must be certain it would appear as a palpable fraud in him three men were enlisted here by sergeant wilper he received both money and provision from me for carrying them up to you and as that afterwards appeared insufficient had a further allowance made and will you after that presume to charge eight pence per diem for their subsistence till they were delivered to you did you pay a farthing on that account and do you not know the eight pennies were allowed the officers for the expence of maintaining and marching their recruits to the rendezvous you have been paid these ten months for a full company and by your returns have never been complete i have instructions to allow for no men but those present therefore i hope you will account for all the noneffective money you have received by the next opportunity agreeable to your returns—to captain hog    july        the following extract from the orderly book issued in general orders by the commander two days after he reached fort cumberland will show that he enforced rigid rules of discipline— colonel washington has observed that the men of his regiment are very profane and reprobate he takes this opportunity of informing them of his great displeasure at such practices and assures them if they do not leave them off they shall be severely punished the officers are desired if they hear any man swear or make use of an oath or execration to order the offender twentyfive lashes immediately without a courtmartial for the second offence they will be more severely punished to a captain he also wrote about the same time—your suffering such clamors among the men argues very great remissness in you i imagined your being put there over them was partly with an intent to keep them quiet and passive but this express sent purely to humor them would indicate that you are afraid to do your duty let me tell you in your own words that i was very much surprised at the contents of your letter written in such a commanding style and your demands were so express and peremptory that the direction was the only thing which gave me the least room to suspect it could be written to any but john roe or some other of your menial servants i am sorry to find your conduct so disagreeable to all the officers as to occasion two who were appointed to your company to resign i must therefore desire you will act circumspectly as i assure you if i have any just complaints made against you you may expect to answer them again to another captain he wrote—you are now to acquaint mr lemon that he is to remain at his fort and act as lieutenant to the rangers until further orders and when he has retired from that he may seek a service which he more prefers since he has refused my offer tell him also not to stir from thence at his peril until he has leave if he does i will arrest him for disobedience of orders and try him so soon as he arrives here notwithstanding there have been orders given that no man should cut off his hair the colonel has observed that some of them have acted contrary to these orders he desires the officers will take notice of those persons and confine them   john rutherford of

question of enlisting indented servants that is immigrants who had hired themselves out for a term of years to repay the money that had been advanced for their passage proved a knotty problem to the colonies when completing the regiments after braddocks defeat the recruiting officers did not hesitate to take such servants often secretly and generally without making recompense to the masters in maryland the planters of the eastern shore were so incensed by such acts that they attacked the recruiting officers and some blood was spilt shirley who became commanderinchief after braddocks death though he could cite the example of massachusetts where indented servants had been impressed for garrisoning the frontier forts was convinced of its impolicy when applied to the middle colonies the assembly of pennsylvania earnestly protested against the practice—penn col records vii    and franklin in his draft of instructions for the agents of the colonies instanced it as one of the grievances of which the province had cause to complain—works ii         and     you must know that most of the servants in this country are more particularly their masters property than they are in any other

four battalions to be commanded by officers bearing the kings commission and called the royal american regiment he was authorized also to enlist servants of the above description paying to their masters a proper compensation for the time they had yet to serve recruiting officers were now employed in virginia enlisting men for the royal regiment and interfered essentially with the enlistments for the service of the colony the governor endeavored to prevail on the assembly to draft militia for this regiment but without success they voted eight thousand pounds to be paid for enlisting men and transporting them to new york—dinwiddies letterbooks the maryland assembly appropriated five thousand pounds to aid enlistments in that colony for the royal regiment and resolved to raise three hundred men a bounty was given not exceeding five pounds for each man enlisted a letter was received by the governor from henry fox one of his majestys principal secretaries of state directing that the compensation to masters for enlisted servants should be paid by the colony but the assembly refused to comply with this order by a majority of more than two to one—see votes and proceedings for september      governor dinwiddie said in reply—if you can enlist servants agreeably to the act of parliament the masters of such servants shall be paid for the time they have to serve in proportion to the first purchase but i think you should be careful not to enlist any convicts who probably may be factious and bad examples to the others   a great body of quakers waited on me in regard to their

only perhaps put them to flight or fright them to another part of the country which answers not the end proposed whereas had we strength enough to invade their lands and assault their towns we should then restrain them from coming abroad and leave their families exposed we should then remove the principal cause and have stronger probability of success we should then be free from the many alarms mischiefs and murders that now attend us we should then inspirit up the hearts of our few indian friends and gain more esteem with them in short could pennsylvania and maryland be induced to join us in an expedition of this nature and to petition his excellency lord loudoun for a small train of artillery with some engineers we should then be able in all human probability to subdue the terror of fort duquesne retrieve our character with the indians and restore peace to our unhappy frontiers i wish sincerely the three colonies could be brought to act in conjunction as our frontiers are so contiguous and our mutual interest so closely connected—to robinson   nov        and indeed the most probable method to render this plan efficacious would be to induce the inhabitants to assemble in townships contiguous to these forts as many of them seem agreeable to the proposal and would be more encouraged by the sanction of the assembly then they could cultivate their lands preserve their stocks and contribute to their mutual security thus did the new englanders settle when infested as we are now and answers well in either case offensive and defensive—to robinson   nov        in reply to a request for the appointment of a chaplain to the regiment governor dinwiddie had written to him—i have recommended to the commissary to get a chaplain but he cannot prevail with any person to accept of it i shall again press it to him   one of these priests was william johnston or johnson who had lived among the french and their allies for two years govr sharpe suspected that he had been engaged in the attacks on the frontier settlements and had surrendered to the english when found on a reconnoiter to discover the expediency of attacking fort cumberland—penn colonial records vii       dinwiddie had written— the abuses mentioned in yours i have been made acquainted with from several hands but i expected you would have been more particular in regard to the officers neglecting their duty and the different forts not being properly garrisoned with men—nay without their officers this vague report makes it impossible for me to call on the delinquents    i am of opinion the string of forts proposed is only weakening our strength and will be a poor defence to our frontiers i hope you will keep the indians properly employed major lewis has orders to send up the cherokees you seem to charge neglect in me not having proper conductors this charge is unmannerly as i did what i thought proper though disappointed by the villanous traders    if you had sent down the amount of the money due for the servants enlisted i should have given a warrant for the money its probable i might have refused payment to masters of some servants enlisted for want of certificates but never said you did not act properly in enlisting them    in regard to a chaplain you should know that his qualifications and the bishops letter of license should be produced to the commissary and myself but this person is also nameless i received the opinion of the council of war in regard to fort cumberland as it was an affair of great consequence i called the council for their advice and enclose you their and my opinion thereon in consequence thereof i hereby order you immediately to march one hundred men to fort cumberland from the forces you have at winchester which captain mercer says are one hundred and sixty enlisted men you are to remain at fort cumberland and make the place as strong as you can in case of an attack you are to send out parties from the fort to observe the motions of the enemy if they should march over the alleghany mountains any stores at the fort not absolutely necessary for its defence you are to send to winchester you are to order one of your subaltern officers in whom you can confide to command at winchester and to oversee the finishing of the fort building at that place these orders i expect you will give due obedience to and i am with respect c   atkin disapproved of offering high rewards to indians for scalps as it encouraged private scalping whereby the most innocent and helpless persons even women and children were murdered for their scalps he instanced also some case where the indians picked quarrel among themselves that the scalp of the killed might be sold further the high rewards sharpened the ingenuity of the indians for the cherokees in particular have got the art of making four scalps out of one man killed atkin asserted that he was well assured lord loudoun detests that practice of purchasing scalps and that the french general montcalm in canadas does the same sir wm johnson gives no reward at all in particular for scalps by name—penn archives iii       i heartily commiserate the poor unhappy inhabitants left by this means exposed to every incursion of a merciless enemy and wish it were in my power to offer them better support than good wishes merely will afford you may assure the settlement that this unexpected and if i may be allowed to say unavoidable step was taken without my concurrence and knowledge that it is an express order from the governor and can neither be evaded nor delayed therefore any representations to me of their danger and the necessity of continuing troops among them will be fruitless for as i before observed i have inclination but no power left to serve them it is also the governors order that the forts be left standing for the inhabitants to possess if they think proper—to captain william bronaugh    dec      a similar order was sent to the commanders of other forts on the south branch   in reply to this letter mr speaker robinson wrote— i am truly concerned at the uneasiness you are under in your present situation and the more so as i am sensible you have too much reason for it the resolution of defending fort cumberland and evacuating the other forts was taken before i knew or mistrusted any thing of the matter i must confess i was not a little surprised at it and took the liberty to expostulate with many of the council upon it who gave me in answer that lord loudoun had insisted that fort cumberland should be preserved and as we had so few troops it could not be done without breaking up the small forts and taking the men from them it was to no purpose to tell them that our frontiers would thereby be entirely exposed to our cruel and savage enemy and that they could receive no protection from fort cumberland as it was in another province and so remote from any of our inhabitants—and further that the act of assembly which gave the money solely for the defence and protection of our frontiers would be violated and the money applied otherwise than the assembly intended yet notwithstanding all i could say they persisted in their resolution without alleging any other reason than that it was in pursuance of lord loudouns desire it cannot be a difficult matter to guess who was the author and promoter of this advice and resolution or by whom lord loudoun has been persuaded that the place is of such importance but supposing it were really so it ought to be defended by the people in whose province it is maryland or at least at the expense of the three colonies jointly and our own frontiers not left exposed for the defence of a place from which we cannot receive the least advantage or protection the present unhappy state of our country must fill the mind of every wellwisher to it with dismal and gloomy apprehensions and without some speedy alterations in our counsels which may god send the fate of it must soon be determined   as your people are enlisted with the money raised for his majestys service and paid with the same and incorporated into a regiment in his pay i conceive they are subject to the articles of war and all other regulations as his majestys more immediate regular forces in this opinion the attorneygeneral agrees with me—dinwiddie to washington    january        sparks very properly suggests that this word should be militia   mr cunningham aiddecamp to lord loudoun acknowledged the receipt of this letter on the   th of february and added his lordship seems very much pleased with the accounts you have given him of the situation of affairs to the southward colonel washington had stationed himself according to orders at fort cumberland he went likewise to philadelphia by consent of the governor his lordship has desired all the southern governors his honor writes to meet him at philadelphia and consult what is proper to be done in these parts as this appears to be the design of this meeting i cannot conceive what service you can be of in going there as the plan concerted will in course be communicated to you and the other officers however as you seem so earnest to go i now give you leave lord loudoun did not go to virginia as originally intended but summoned the governors of the southern colonies to confer with him at philadelphia where they began to assemble in the middle of february but did not formally meet until march    the conference lasted nine days the general informed the governors that his instructions were to employ the greatest number of the troops to the northward but to protect the southern colonies he would leave about   00 men and fearing an attack on carolina from the creek territory he further detailed col bouquet to charlestown to command  000 men   00 of whom were to be raised by the southern colonies and of this number virginia was to contribute  00 men this council of governors decided that the virginia troops should be withdrawn from fort cumberland as soon as maryland could garrison it under capt dagworthy washington removed to fort loudoun   in a letter dated on the  th of april governor dinwiddie believing that gov sharpe had already directed fort cumberland to be garrisoned by maryland troops had ordered the immediate evacuation of the place by the virginia troops and also that two hundred men should be forthwith despatched to fredericksburg under colonel stephen destined by direction of lord loudoun for south carolina where an attack from the enemy was apprehended both by sea and on the frontiers in another letter dated on the  th the governor had reiterated his orders in this dilemma a council of war was called who decided that the fort ought not to be evacuated till the maryland forces under captain dagworthy should arrive fort cumberland seemed destined to be a perpetual source of uneasiness in some quarter when the maryland assembly met governor sharpe requested means to supply provisions for that garrison the assembly retorted with a warmth of disapprobation amounting to a reprimand that garrison say they was stationed contrary to the plain destination of all the forces raised and to be supported by law and if any evil consequences have heretofore or may hereafter follow a want of supplies let those answer for them who have contrary to law been the means of stationing troops where they had no authority to place them—votes and proceedings for october      the maryland assembly denied the power of lord loudoun over the forces raised and paid by that colony and his right to command them under any exigency without their consent whereupon his lordship wrote a letter to governor sharpe protesting against this doctrine as without precedent and peculiar to maryland alone—ibid for february      governor dinwiddie declared it inconsistent and unmannerly in the maryland assembly to make any hesitation or to dispute his lordships power—letter to governor sharpe   one hundred and twentyfour catawbas had arrived without notice at fort cumberland on the  th the two catawbas were killed while pleasuring in a canoe some distance from the fort—penn col records vii  0  the catawbas and cherokees were to go on an expedition against the shawnees   the governor discontinued the two per cent commission but allowed washington an additional sum of £ 00 a year for his table and expenses   the assembly having considered the great expense the virginia regiment has cost the country from the number of companies it has consisted of and those companies not half complete in proportion to the vast charge of officers remodelled its form and made it consist of ten companies of  00 men each reducing all captains but seven the force was distributed as follows— at fort loudoun  00 men commanded by washington  maidstone  0 capt stewart edwards    a subaltern pearsalls    capt mckenzie in the neighborhood of buttermilk fort   0 capt waggener dickinsons  0 maj lewis vosss  0 capt woodward washington was to remain at winchester and was deprived of all concern with or management of indian affairs mr atkin being appointed the kings agent to take charge of all affairs relating to the indians who inhabited the country between pennsylvania and georgia   when i proceed to the southward i shall appoint some person to act for me in this colony according to my instructions during my absence who i believe will be capt gist who resigns his post in the virginia regiment he is so well recommended to me and does i believe understand the indian affairs so much better than any man else i can find or hear of in this colony that i hope he will give satisfaction to all that will be interested in his behaviour—atkin to gov sharpe  0 june        washingtons experience with indian allies was not such as to give him great confidence in them the catawbas have been of little use but a great expence to this colony and are now gone home the cherokees i apprehend will follow their example there is a party of  0 or  0 of them with some soldiers now out commanded by major lewis of the regiment but i expect very little from them as i conceive it will scarcely be in the power of the officers to carry them far enough to do much service—to col stanwix    may        in his letter to dinwiddie he says cherokee   warhatche spelt also wawhatchee and probably the wahawtehew mentioned by dinwiddie was chief of all the southern cherokee towns atkin described him as the greatest rogue among them most certainly of unbounded avarice well and long known to me in particular and not having the least regard for the english further than he can get presents from them the cause of the separation mentioned by washington is fully described in a letter from atkin to croghan in penn archives iii       i fear that the different colonies struggling with each other for their assistance will be productive of very great evils and in the end introduce insupportable expence to these governments or to the crown maryland hath already held treaties with and given presents to them pennsylvania hath sent speeches to them and offers presents and to the latter a great part is now gone the consequence is that these savages look upon themselves in a more important light than ever and have behaved very insolently thereupon—to dinwiddie  0 june      as to indian matters you must know i can be but a stranger and i find all those employed as agents very jealous of one another and i can perceive mr croghan so of colonel armstrong and    mr atkin so of them all as well as of the provinces—col stanwix to gov denny    june      armstrong said that atkin was miffed about the provinces taking any notice of the southern tribes without first consulting him while croghan believed that atkin had been prejudiced by the virginians atkin wrote to croghan on june   that on arriving in virginia he found it just on the brink of confusion and distraction by means of the very indians that had been drawn with great pains and expence to its assistance as they behaved like freebooters in an enemies country and to governor sharpe you will see how fortunate my being at williamsburg was to prevent a convulsion which must otherways happened in this colony and shaken all the colonies in its consequences   that matter which i hinted to you about mercer is since cleared up he borrowed £  0 by my order and for the use of the public while he remained at this place  was ordered to fort cumberland and went off from here without rendering me any account of it so that i was liable for payment and unacquainted with the disbursement—to robinson  0 july        colonel stanwix was stationed by the earl of loudoun on the frontiers of pennsylvania with the command of five companies of the royal american regiment and such troops as pennsylvania maryland and virginia might raise he was now at lancaster but his headquarters were afterwards at carlisle   these officers were wounded but the indians killed them in revenge for the death of the truly brave swallow warrior   the swallow fired first knocked down an officer and on springing up to scalp him was unfortunately shot through the head—armstrong to gov denny    june        washington had recently been taken to task by the governor for asking allowance for a greater number of batmen than col stanwix had surely colo washington wont expect more than colo stanwix and surely it was your duty to inform me of this and conform your regiment to the allowance given the royal americans and pray how shall i appear to lord loudoun on my report of our regiment when so widely different from that he commands    you know the clamor of the people in regard to the vast expense and its your duty as well as mine to make all prudent savings—dinwiddie to washington   june        six cherokee indians came to fort cumberland and told captain dagworthy that they saw the french near fort duquesne coming in that direction with wagons and great guns three indians wrote washington to county lieutenants are come in wounded and saw the french army this side of monongahela near the place of genl braddocks defeat so that the truth of this report is i believe unquestionable an attack was apprehended the country alarmed the militia called out and colonel stanwixs regulars were put in motion but it proved to be a false report the council of war was held at two oclock in the morning its determination was that as reinforcing this garrison is absolutely necessary that the detached enfeebled situation of the garrisons on the south branch must make them fall an easy prey to the enemy and that as drawing them all to one place on the branch would be giving up all the settlements except that place which supposing it could be maintained would by no means be of such consequence as reinforcing this important place that therefore they ought to be ordered hither immediately colonel washington told me armstrong wrote to gov denny if he the enemy came without erecting something by the way that it was not in his power to be early enough to assist the garrison nor would all his men be more than a breakfast to the french and their indians—penn archives iii       the assembly had voted to increase the regiment to   00 men and three companies of rangers of  00 men each appropriating £ 0000 for the establishment   the storm which threatened us with such formidable appearances is in a manner blown over it arose in a great measure from a misunderstanding in captn dagworthy of the indians for want of a proper interpreter the indians are nevertheless unanimous in asserting that a large body of french and indians have marched from fort duquesne but without artillery and that they pursued the rays town road which leads very conveniently to the three colonies of virginia maryland and pennsylvania—to colo fairfax    june      i have since received various intelligence of their appearing at many different parts widely distant from each other at the same time which inclines me to think that they have detached their principal force into many scalping parties—to dinwiddie    june        commandant of the garrison at fort frederick in maryland   colonel washington was in some sort under the command of colonel stanwix but to what extent he did not know as he had received no instructions on that head and the governor continued to issue his orders as formerly at length the governor wrote as follows—colonel stanwix being appointed commanderinchief of the middle and southern provinces you must submit to his orders without regard to any you have from me he being near the place can direct affairs better than i can notwithstanding the above direction the governor did not cease to write give commands require returns and utter complaints as usual thereby increasing the endless perplexities and bewildering doubts with which colonel washington was harassed in all his plans and operations it has heretofore been seen that he had requested leave of absence for a few days to attend to certain private affairs of a very pressing nature at mount vernon he afterwards repeated this request and as he seemed to be under two commanders he thought it expedient to consult them both the governor answered—as to the settlement of your brothers estate your absence on that account from fort loudoun must be suspended till our affairs give a better prospect colonel stanwix replied to the same request—more than two weeks ago i answered your letter in which you mentioned its being convenient to your private affairs to attend to them for a fortnight in that answer i expressed my concern that you should think such a thing necessary to mention to me as i am sure you would not choose to be out of call should the service require your immediate attendance and i hope you will always take that liberty upon yourself which i hope you will now do   also spelled outacita he was one of the most noted cherokee chiefs of the day and as early as      was known as king of the lower and middle cherokee settlements in    0 he visited england with sir alexander cumming and entered into a treaty with george ii his name occurs frequently in connection with indian affairs in the colonial records and as late as july      he signed the treaty of holston—maxwell virginia historical register v      if there should be any thing done in it purchase of clothing i hope as it is a perquisite inseparable from the colonel that the country will allow it to me especially since the governor has stripped me of the only one that was allowed and substituted a very inadequate reward in its room—to robinson  0 july        a person employed to ride express between williamsburg and the army   our printing office is so closely engaged in printing the paper currency that i could not get the mutiny and desertion act in print—dinwiddie to washington    july        the postoffice of the colonies was at this time under the management of franklin and colonel john hunter and its service extended from georgia to new hampshire the assembly of pennsylvania when braddock marched west had established a special post from winchester to philadelphia for the accommodation of the army chiefly but as early as august      franklin had given notice that it must be discontinued unless supported by grants from maryland and virginia—franklin works ii   0 governor denny of pennsylvania asserted that franklin took advantage of his official position to circulate his newspaper and receive intelligence free which he may make the best or worst use of in the present situation of affairs—penn colonial records vii       upon the receipt of this letter governor sharpe at once issued circular instructions calling upon all and every of the officers both civil and military in baltimore county to use their best endeavors in securing the deserters   your honor will i hope excuse my hanging instead of shooting them it conveyed much more terror to others and it was for example sake that we did it—to dinwiddie   aug        sergeant fent who had recently escaped from fort du quesne the governor described him as a wellbehaved man   in the letter to which this was an answer the governor had used much freedom of complaint and censure you have sent a detachment from the regiment to augusta he observed but you do not mention the number nor do you mention the receipt of the small arms sent from this nor any account of the misunderstanding with the indians at winchester you must allow this is a loose way of writing and it is your duty to be more particular to me   captain spotswood with a party under him had been cut off by the indians   william henry the son of col fairfax   the commission had not been solicited by colonel washington nor was the application of mr fairfaxs friends made through him but directly to the governor   the letter begins by detailing a conversation which the writer had lately held with mr charles carter of shirley respecting a transaction in which captain peachy had been concerned some months before on a mission to williamsburgh when the frontiers were in great alarm from the incursions of the enemy and then proceeds— he mr carter says that mr christopher robinson told him he heard colonel richard corbin say that i affirmed that my whole business at that time was to execute a scheme of yours to cause the assembly to levy largely both in men and money and that there was not an indian in the neighbourhood that the frontiers or even winchester and the adjacent country did not appear to be in any more danger at that time than any other mr robinson also informed mr carter it was said that that piece of deceit or imposition of yours as they term it had lessened the governors and some of the leading mens esteem for you or at least they make use of it as a reason for their ill treatment and the worse opinion they say they have than formerly of you i hope colo washington knows me better than even to suppose i could be guilty of a thing of this kind therefore shall only add that you may depend i shall use my endeavor to trace the matter till i find the scoundrel that dares make himself the author of such a scandalous report if you think fit to make use of the above you are at full liberty to do so   to this request governor dinwiddie replied in a letter dated september   th— your other letter of the   th i perused i would gladly hope there is no truth in it i never heard of it before or did i ever conceive you would have sent down any alarms without proper foundation however i shall show it to colonel corbin when he comes to town but i d advise you not to give credit to every idle story you hear for if i was to notice reports of different kinds i should be constantly perplexed my conduct to you from the beginning was always friendly but you know i had great reason to suspect you of ingratitude which i am convinced your own conscience and reflection must allow i had reason to be angry but this i endeavor to forget but i cannot think colonel corbin guilty of what is reported however as i have his majestys leave to go for england i propose leaving this in november and i wish my successor may show you as much friendship as i have done   bryan fairfax died   sept        charles washington married mildred daughter of col francis thornton of spotswood county he laid out the town of charlestown in jefferson co w va   tumbler is a provincialism for tumbrel   acknowledged by dinwiddie as written on the  d   i cannot agree to allow you leave to come down at this time you have been frequently indulged with leave of absence you know the fort is to be finished and i fear when you are away little will be done and surely the commanding officer should not be absent when daily alarmed with the enemys intentions to invade our frontiers and i think you were wrong in asking it you have no accounts that i know of to settle with me and what accounts you have to settle with the country may be done at a more proper time—dinwiddie to washington    october        from the time that the virginia regiment was organized it had been colonel washingtons opinion that an offensive war should be kept up against the enemy in this sentiment governor dinwiddie agreed with him and he urged upon lord loudoun the advantage of an expedition against fort duquesne but the great operations at the north absorbed his lordships attention and he placed the whole southern frontier upon the defensive hence the enemy made perpetual inroads committing murders and ravages considering the weak state of the garrison at fort duquesne a large portion of which had been withdrawn to defend the canada borders it was deemed an object of easy attainment as no doubt it was for colonel stanwix with his five hundred royal americans in conjunction with the virginia and maryland troops to seize that fort this would have effectually put a stop to all the savage depredations but such were not his orders and nothing was done the indians were emboldened by this inactivity and the frontier inhabitants were molested in every quarter—sparks   the speaker at the conclusion of his answer to this letter after mentioning the governors intended departure writes— we have not yet heard who is to succeed him god grant it may be somebody better acquainted with the unhappy business we have in hand and who by his conduct and counsel may dispel the cloud now hanging over this distressed country till that event i beg my dear friend that you will bear so far as a man of honor ought the discouragements and slights you have too often met with and continue to serve your country as i am convinced you have always hitherto done in the best manner you can with the small assistance afforded you   it will be remembered that colonel washington was not now charged with indian affairs nor furnished with any instructions on that head an agent had been appointed for the purpose   this was his last letter to governor dinwiddie it was duly answered and further provisions were made for the indians colonel washington was now laboring under an indisposition which shortly increased to an alarming illness he left the army at the pressing request of the surgeon dr craik his physician and intimate friend through life and retired to mount vernon where he was reduced so low by dysentery and fever that it was more than four months before he was able to resume his command the governor sailed for europe in january george mason the neighbour and friend of colonel washington wrote to him on the  th of january urging him not to think of joining the army in the present state of his health and adding—you will in all probability bring on a relapse and render yourself incapable of serving the public at a time when there may be the utmost occasion there is nothing more certain than that a gentleman of your station owes the care of his health and his life not only to himself and his friends but to his country
