distinguished for the same excellence have generally had something in their lives similar to each other the place of homers nativity has not been more variously conjectured or his parents more differently assigned than our authors leland who lived nearest to chaucers time of all those who have wrote his life was commissioned by king henry viii to search all the libraries and religious houses in england when those archives were preserved before their destruction was produced by the reformation or polydore virgil had consumed such curious pieces as would have contradicted his framed and fabulous history he for some reasons believed oxford or berkshire to have given birth to this great man but has not informed us what those reasons were that induced him to believe so and at present there appears no other but that the seats of his family were in those countries pitts positively asserts without producing any authority to support it that woodstock was the place which opinion mr camden seems to hint at where he mentions that town but it may be suspected that pitts had no other ground for the assertion than chaucers mentioning woodstock park in his works and having a house there but after all these different pretensions he himself in the testament of love seems to point out the place of his nativity to be the city of london and though mr camden mentions the claim of woodstock he does not give much credit to it for speaking of spencer who was uncontrovertedly born in london he calls him fellow citizen to chaucer  the descent of chaucer is as uncertain and unfixed by the critics as the place of his birth mr speight is of opinion that one richard chaucer was his father and that one elizabeth chaucer a nun of st helens in the second year of richard ii might have been his sister or of his kindred but this conjecture says urry life of chaucer prefixed to ogles edition of that author modernized seems very improbable for this richard was a vintner living at the corner of kirtonlane and at his death left his house tavern and stock to the church of st mary aldermary which in all probability he would not have done if he had had any sons to possess his fortune nor is it very likely he could enjoy the family estates mentioned by leland in oxfordshire and at the same time follow such an occupation pitts asserts that his father was a knight but though there is no authority to support this assertion yet it is reasonable to suppose that he was something superior to a common employ we find one john chaucer attending upon edward iii and queen philippa in their expedition to flanders and cologn who had the kings protection to go over sea in the twelfth year of his reign it is highly probable that this gentleman was father to our geoffry and the supposition is strengthened by chaucers first application after leaving the university and inns of law being to the court nor is it unlikely that the service of the father should recommend the son  it is universally agreed that he was born in the second year of the reign of king edward iii a d      his first studies were in the university of cambridge and when about eighteen years of age he wrote his court of love but of what college he was is uncertain there being no account of him in the records of the university from cambridge he was removed to oxford in order to complete his studies and after a considerable stay there and a strict application to the public lectures of the university he became says leland a ready logician a smooth rhetorician a pleasant poet a great philosopher an ingenious mathematician and a holy divine that he was a great master in astronomy is plain by his discourses of the astrolabe that he was versed in hermetic philosophy which prevailed much at that time appears by his tale of the chanons yeoman his knowledge in divinity is evident from his parsons tale and his philosophy from the testament of love thus qualified to make a figure in the world he left his learned retirement and traveled into france holland and other countries where he spent some of his younger days upon his return he entered himself in the inner temple where he studied the municipal laws of the land but he had not long prosecuted that dry study till his superior abilities were taken notice of by some persons of distinction by whose patronage he then approached the splendour of the court the reign of edward iii was glorious and successful he was a discerning as well as a fortunate monarch he had a taste as well for erudition as for arms he was an encourager of men of wit and parts and permitted them to approach him without reserve at edwards court nothing but gallry and a round of pleasure prevailed and how well qualifed ou poet was to shine in the soft circles whoever has read his works will be at no loss to determine but besides the advantages of his wit and learning he possessed those of person in a very considerable degree he was then about the age of thirty of a fair beautiful complexion his lips red and full his size of a just medium and his air polished and graceful so that he united whatever could claim the approbation of the great and charm the eyes of the fair he had abilities to record the valor of the one and celebrate the beauty of the other and being qualified by his genteel behavior to entertain both he became a finished courtier the first dignity to which we find him preferred was that of page to the king a place of so much honor and esteem at that time that richard ii leaves particular legacies to his pages when few others of his servants are taken notice of in the fortyfirst year of edward iii he received as a reward of his services an annuity of twenty marks per ann payable out of the exchequer which in those days was no inconsiderable pnsion in a year after he was advanced to be of his majestys privy chamber and a very few months to be his shield bearer a title at that time though now extinct of very great honor being always next the kings person and generally upon signal victories rewarded with military honors our poet being thus eminent by his places contracted friendships and procured the esteem of persons of the first quality queen philippa the duke of lancaster and his duchess blanch showed particular honor to him and lady margaret the kings daughter and the countess of pembroke gave him their warmest patronage as a poet in his poems called the romaunt and the rose and troilus and creseide he gave offense to some court ladies by the looseness of his description which the lady margaret resented and obliged him to atone for it by his legend of good women a piece as chaste as the others were luxuriously amorous and under the name of the daisy he veils lady margaret whom of all his patrons he most esteemed  thus loved and honored his younger years were dedicated to pleasure and the court by the recommendation of the duchess blanch he married one philippa rouet sister to the guardianess of her graces children who was a native of hainault he was then about thirty years of age and being fixed by marriage the king began to employ him in more public and advantageous posts in the fortysixth year of his majestys reign chaucer was sent to venice in commission with others to treat with the doge and senate of genoa about affairs of great importance to our state the duke of lancaster whose favorite passion was ambition which demanded the assistance of learned men engaged warmly in our poets interest besides the duke was remarkably fond of lady catherine swynford his wises sister who was then guardianess to his children and whom he afterward made his wife thus was he doubly attached to chaucer and with the varying fortune of the duke of lancaster we fid him rie or fall much about this time for his successful negociations at genoa the king granted to him by letters patent by the title of armiger noster one pitcher of vine aily in the port of london and soon after mad him comptroller of the customs with this particular proviso that he should personally execute the office and write the accounts relating to it with his own hand  but as he was advanced to higher places of trust so he became more entangled in the affairs of state the consequence of which proved very prejudicial to him the duke of lancaster having been the chief instrument of raising him to dignity expected the fruits of those favors in a ready compliance with him in all his designs that prince was certainly one of the proudest and most ambitious men of his time nor could he patiently bear the name of a  even to his father nothing but absolute power and the title of king could satisfy him upon the death of his elder brother edward the black prince he fixed an eye upon the english own and seemed to stretch out an impatient  to  it in this view he sought by all  possible to secure his interest against the  of the old king and being afraid of the opposition of the clergy who are always strenu against an irregular succession he embraced the opinions and espoused the interests of wickliff who now appeared at oxford and being a man of very great abilities and much esteemed at court drew over to his party great numbers as well fashionable as low people in this confusion the duke of lancaster endeavored all he could to shake the power of the clergy and to procure votaries amongst the leading popular men chaucer had no small hand in promoting these proceedings both by his public interest and writings toward the close of edwards reign he was very active in the intrigues of the court party and so recommended himself to the prince successor that upon his asconding the throne he confirmed to him by the title of dilects armiger noster the gant made by the late king of twenty marks per annum and at the same time confirmed the other grant of the late king for a pitcher of wine to be delivered him daily in the port of london in less than two years after this we find our poet so reduced in his circumsance but by what means is unknown that the king in order to screen him from his creditors took him under his protection and allowed him still to enjoy his former grants the duke of lancaster whose restless ambition ever excited him to disturb the state engaged now with all the interest of which he was master to promote himself to the crown the opinions of wickliff gained ground and so great a commotion now prevailed amongst the clergy that the king perceiving the state in danger and being willing to support the clerical interest suffered the archbishop of cantrbury to summon wickliff to appear before him whose interest after this arraignment very much decayed some biographers of chaucer say that pope gregory ix gave orders to the archbishop of canterbury to summon him and that when a synod was convened at st pauls a quarrel happened between the bishop of london and the duke of lancaster concerning wickliffs sitting down in their presence the king who was devoted to his pleasures resigned himself to some young courtiers who hated the duke of lancaster and caused a friar to accuse him of an attempt to kill the king but before he had an opportunity of making out the charge against him the friar was murdered in a cruel and barbarous manner by lord john holland to whose care he had been committed this lord john holland called lord huntington and duke of exeter was half brother to the king and had married elizabeth daughter of the duke of lancaster he was a great patron of chaucer and much respected by him with the duke of lancasters interest chaucers also sunk his patron being unable to support him he could no longer struggle against opposite parties or maintain his pos of honor the duke passing over sea his friends felt all the malice of an enraged court which induced them to call in a number of the populace to assist them of which our poet was a zealous promoter one john of northampton a late lord mayor of london was at the head of these disturbances which did not long continue for upon beheading one of the rioters and northamptons being taken into custody the commtion subsided strict search was made after chaucer who escaped into hainault afterward he went to france and finding the king resolute to get him into his hands he fled from thence to zealand several accomplices in this affair were with him whom he supprted in their exile while the chief ringleaders except northampton who was condemned at reading upon the evidence of his clerk had restored themselves to court favor by acknowledging their crime and now forgot the integrity and resolution of chaucer who suffered exile to secure their secrets and so monstrously ungrateful were they that they wished his death and by keeping supplies of money from him endeavored to effect it  while he expended his fortune in removing from place to place and in supporting his fellow exiles so far from receiving any assistance from england his apartments were let and the money received for rent was never acccounted for to him nor could he recover any from those who owed it him they being of opinion it was impossible for him ever to return to his own country the government  pursuing their resentment against him and his friends they were obliged to leave zealand and chaucer being unable to bear longer the calamities of poverty and exile and finding no security wherever he fled chose rather to throw himself upon the laws of his country than perish abroad by hunger and oppression he had not long returned till he was arrested by order of the king and confined in the tower of london the court sometimes flattered him with the return of the royal favor if he would impeach his accomplices and sometimes threatened him with immediate destruction their threats and promises he along while disregarded but recollecting the ingratitude of his old friends and the miseries he had already suffered he at last made a confession and according to the custom of trials at that time offered to prove the truth of it by combat what the consequence of this discovery was to his accomplices is uncertain it no doubt exposed him to their resentment and procured him the name of a traitor but the king who regarded him as one beloved by his grandfather was pleased to pardon him thus fallen from a height of greatness our poet retired to bemoan the sickleness of fortune and then wrote his testament of love in which are many pathetic exclamations concerning the vicissitude of human things which he then bitterly experienced but as he had formerly been the favorite of fortune when dignities were multiplied thick upon him so his miseries now succeeded with an equal swiftness he was not only discarded by his majesty unpensioned and abandoned but he lost the favor of the duke of lancaster as the influence of his wifes sister with that prince was now much lessened the duke being dejected with the troubles in which he was involved began to reflect on his vicious course of life and particularly his keeping that lady as his concubine which produced a resolution of putting her out of his house and he made a vow to that purpose chaucer thus reduced and weary of the perpetual turmoils at court retired to woodstock to enjoy a studious quiet where he wrote his excellent treatise of the astrolabe but notwithstanding the severe treatment of the government he still retained his loyalty and strictly enjoined his son to pray for the king as the pious resolutions of some people are often the consequence of a present evil so at the return of prosperity they are soon dissipated this proved the case with the duke of lancaster his party again gathered strength his interest began to rise upon which he took again his mistress to his bosom and not content with heaping favors honors and titles upon her he made her his wife procured an act of parliament to legitimate her children which gave great offense to the duchess of gloucester the countess of derby and arundel as she then was entitled to take place of them with her interest chaucers also returned and after a long and bitter storm the sun began to shine upon him with an evening ray for at the sixtyfifth year of his age the king granted to him by the title of delectus armiger noster an annuity of twenty marks per annum during his life as a compensation for the former pension his needy circumstances obliged him to part with but however sufficient that might be for present support yet as he was encumbered with debts he durst not appear publicly till his majesty again granted him his royal protection to screen him from the persecution of his creditors he also restored to him his grant of a pitcher of wine daily and a pipe annually to be delivered to him by his son thomas who that year possessed the office of chief butler to the king  now that i have mentioned his son it will not be improper to take a view of our authors domestical affairs at least as far as we are enabled by materials that have descended to our times  thomas his eldest son was married to one of the greatest fortunes in england maud daughter and heir of sir john burgheershe knight of the garter and dr henry burghurshe bishop of lincoln chancellor and treasurer of england mr speight says this lady was given him in marriage by edward iii in return of his services performed in his embassies in france his second son lewis was born in      for when his father wrote the treatise of the astrolabe he was ten years old he was then a student in merton college in oxford and pupil to nicholas strade but there is no further account of him thomas who now enjoyed the office of chief butler to his majesty had the same place confirmed to him for life by letters patent to king henry iv and continued by henry vi in the  d year of henry iv we find him speaker of the house of commons sheriff of oxfordshire and berkshire and constable of wallingford castle and knaresborough castle during life in the  th year of the same prince he was sent ambassador to france in the  th of the same reign the commons presented him their speaker as they did likewise in the   th year soon after this queen jane granted to him for his good service the manor of woodstock hannerborough and wotten during life and in the   th year he was again presented speaker as he was in the  d of henry v and much about that time he was sent by the king to treat of a marriage with catherine daughter to the duke of burgundy he was sent again ambassador to france and passed through a great many public stations mr stebbing says that he was knighted but we find no such title given him in any record he died at ewelm the chief place of his residence in the year      by his wife maud he had one daughter named alice who was thrice married first to sir john philips and afterward to thomas montacute earl of salisbury her third husband was the famous william de la pole duke of suffolk who lost his head by the fury of the yorkists who dreaded his influence in the opposite party though he stood proscribed by the parliament of henry vi for misguiding that easy prince their son john had three sons the second of whom edmund forfeited his life to the crown for treason against henry vii by which means the estates which chaucers family possessed came to the crown but to return to our poet by means of the duke of lancasters marriage with his sister in law he again grew to a considerable share of wealth but being now about seventy years of age and fatigued with a tedious view of hurried greatness he quitted the stage of grandeur where he had acted so considerable a part with varied success and retired to dunnigton castle mr camden gives a particular description of this castle near newbury to reflect at leisure upon past transactions in the still retreats of contemplation in this retirement did he spend his few remaining years universally loved and honored he was familiar with all men of learning in his time and contracted friendship with persons of the greatest eminence as well in literature as politics gower occleve lidgate wickliffe were great admirers and particular friends of chaucer besides he was well acquainted with foreign poets particularly francis petrarch the famous italian poet and refiner of the language a revolution in england soon after this happened in which we find chaucer but little concerned he made no mean compliments to henry iv but gower his cotemporary though then very old flattered the reigning prince and insulted the memory of his murdered sovereign all acts of parliament and grantsin the last reign being annulled chaucer again repaired to court to get fresh grants but bending with age and weakness though he was successful in his request the fatigue of attendance so overcame him that death prevented his enjoying his new possessions he died the   th of october in the year   00 in the second of henry iv in the   d of his age and bore the shock of death with the same fortitude and resignatin with which he had undergone a variety of pressures and vicissitudes of fortune  dryden says he was poet laureat to three kings but urry is of opinion that dryden must be mistaken as among all his works not one court poem is to be found and seldom observes that he could find no poet honored with that title in england before the reign of edward iv to whom one john kaye dedicated the siege of rhodes in prose by the title of his humble poet laureat  i cannot better display the character of this great man than in the following words of urry as to his temper says he he had a mixture of the gay the modest and the grave his reading was deep and extensive his judgment sound and discerning he was communicative of his knowledge and ready to correct or pass over the faults of his cotemporary writers he knew how to judge of and excuse the slips of weaker capacities and pitied rather than exposed the ignorance of that age in one word he was a great scholar a pleasant wit a candid critic a sociable companion a steadfast friend a great philosopher a temperate oeconomist and a pious christian as to his genius as a poet dryden than whom a higher authority cannot be produced speaking of homer and virgil positively asserts that our author exceeded the latter and stands in competition with the former  his language how unintelligible soever it may seem is almost as modern as any of his cotemporaries or of those who followed him at the distance of  0 or  0 years as harding skeleton and others and in some places it is so smooth and beautiful that dryden would not attempt to alter it i shall now give some account of his works in the order in which they were written so far as can be collected from them and subjoin a specimen of his poetry of which profession as he may justly be called the morning star so as we descend into later times we may see the progress of poetry in england from its great original chaucer to its full blaze and perfect consummation in dryden  mr philips supposes a greater part of his works to be lost than what we have extant of him of that number may be many a song and many a lecherous lay which perhaps might have been written by him while he was a student at cambridge  the court of love as has been before observed was written while he resided at cambridge in the   th year of his age  the craft lovers was written in the year of our lord      and probably the remedy of love was written about that time or not long after  the lamentation of mary magdalen taken from origin was written by him in his early years and perhaps boethius de consolatione philosophiae was translated by him about the same time  the romaunt of the rose is a translation from the french this poem was begun by william de lerris and continued by john de meun both famous french poets it seems to have been translated about the time of the rise of wickliffes opinions it consisting of violent invectives against religious orders  the complaint of the black knight during john of gaunts courtship with blanch is supposed to be written on account of the duke of lancasters marriage  the poem of troilus and creseide was written in the early part of his life translated as he says from lollius an historiographer in urbane in italy he has added several things of his own and borrowed from others what he thought proper for the embellishment of this work and in this respect was much indebted to his friend petrarch the italian poet  the house of fame from this poem mr pope acknowledges he took the hint of his temple of fame  the book of blaunch the duchess commonly called the dreme of chaucer was written upon the death of that lady  the assembly of fowls or parliament of briddis as he calls it in his retraction was written before the death of queen philippa  the life of st cecilia seems to have been first a single poem afterward made one of his canterbury tales which is told by the second nonne and so perhaps was that of the wife of bath which he advises john of gaunt to read and was afterward inserted in his canterbury tales  the canterbury tales were written about the year      it is certain the tale of the nonnes priest was written after the insurrection of jack straw and wat tyler  the flower and the leaf was written by him in the prologue to the legend of good women  chaucers abc called la priere de nostre dame was written for the use of the duchess blaunch  the book of the lion is mentioned in his retraction and by lidgate in the prologue to the fall of princes but is now lost as is that  de vulcani vene i e of the brocke of vulcan which is likewise mentioned by lidgate  la belle dame sans mercy was translated from the french of alain chartier secretary to lewis xi king of france  the complaint of mars and venus was translated from the french of sir otes de grantson a french poet  the complaint of annilida to false arcite  the legend of good women called the assembly of ladies and by some the nineteen ladies was written to oblige the queen at the request of the countess of pembroke  the treatise of the conclusion of the astrolabie was written in the year       of the cuckoo and nightingale this seems by the description to have been written at woodstock  the ballade beginning in feverre etc was a compliment to the countess of pembroke  several other ballads are ascribed to him some of which are justly suspected not to havebeen his the comedies imputed to him are no other than his canterbury tales and the tragedies were those the monks tell in his tales  the testament of love was written in his trouble the latter part of his life  the song beginning fly sro the prese etc was written in his deathbed  leland says that by the consent of the learned in his time the plowmans tale was attributed to chaucer but was suppressed in the edition then extant because the vices of the clergy were exposed in it mr speight in his life of chaucer printed in   0  mentions a tale in william thynnes first printed book of chaucers works more odious to the clergy than the plowmans tale one thing must not be omitted concering the works of chaucer in the year      the bishop of london prohibited a great number of books which he thought had a tendency to destroy religion and virtue as did also the king in      but in so great esteem were his works then and so highly valued by the people of taste that they were excepted out of the prohibition of that act  the pardoners prologue lordings quoth he in chirch when i preche i pain me to

that has his hand well put in this mittaine he shall have multiplying of his grain when he has sown be it wheat or otes so that he offer good pens or grotes those who would prefer the thoughts of this father of english poetry in a modern dress are referred to the elegant versions of him by dryden pope and others who have done ample justice to their illustrious predecessor  langland it has been disputed amongst the critics whether this pet preceded or followed chaucer mrs cooper thor of the muses library is of opinion that he preceded chaucer and observes that in more places than one that great poet seems to copy langland but i am rather inclined to believe that he was cotemporary with him which accounts for her observation and my conjecture is strengthened by the consideration of his style which is equally unmusical and obsolete with chaucers and though dryden has told us that chaucer exceeded those who followed him at  0 or  0 years distance in point of smoothness yet with great submission to his judgment i think there is some alteration even in skeleton and harding which will appear to the reader to the best advantage by a quotation of langlands family we have no account seldom in his notes on draitons poly olbion quotes him with honor but he is entirely neglected by philips and winstanly though he seems to have been a man of great genius besides chaucer few poets in that or the subsequent age had more real inspiration or poetical enthusiasm in their compositions one cannot read the works of this author or chaucer without lamenting the unhappiness of a fluctuating language that buries in its ruins even genius itself for like edifices of sand every breath of time defaces it and if the form remain the beauty is lost the piece from which i shall quote a few lines is a work of great length and labor of the allegoric kind it is animated with a lively and luxurious imagination pointed with a variety of pungent satire and dignisied with many excellent lessons of morality but as to the conduct of the whole it does not appear to be of a piece every vision seems a distinct rhapsody and does not carry on either one single action or a series of many but we ought rather to wonder at its beauties than cavil at its defects and if the poetical design is broken the moral is entire which is uniformly the advancement of piety and resormation of the roman clergy the piece before us is entitled the vision os piers the plowman and i shall quote that particular part which seems to have furnished a hint to milton in his paradise lost b   l     kind conscience though

triumphant death his dart shook p l b xi l      sir john gower flourished in the reign of edward iii and richard ii he was cotemporary with chaucer and much esteemed and honored by him as appears by his submitting his troilus and cressida to his censure stow in his survey of london seems to be of opinion that he was no knight but only an esquire however it is certain he was descended of a knightly family at sittenham in yorkshire he received his education in london and studied the law but being possessed of a great fortune he dedicated himself more to pleasure and poetry than the bar though he seems not to have made any proficiency in poetry for his works are rather cool translations than originals and are quite destitute of poetical fire bale makes him equitem auratum and poetam laureatum but winstanly says that he was neither laureated nor hederated but only rosated having a chaplet of four roses about his head in his monumental stone erected in st mary overys southwark he was held in great esteem by king richard ii to whom he dedicates a book called confessio amantis that he was a man of no honor appears by his behavior when the revolution under henry iv happened in england he was under the highest obligations to richard ii he had been preferred patronized and honored by him yet no sooner did that unhappy prince who owed his misfortunes in a great measure to his generosity and easiness of nature fall a sacrifice to the policy of henry and the rage of rebellion but he worshipped the rising sun he joined his interest with the new king and though he was then stoneblind and as might naturally be imagined too old to desire either riches or power yet he was capable of the grossest flattery to the reigning prince and like an ungratefal monster insulted the memory of his murdered sovereign and generous patron he survived chaucer two years winstanly says that in his old age he was made a judge possibly in consequence of his adulation to henry iv his death happened in the year   0  and as he is said to have been born some years before chaucer so he must have been near fourscore years of age he was buried in st mary overys in southwark in the chapel of st john where he founded a chauntry and lest money for a mass to be daily sung for him as also an obit within the church to be kept on friday after the feast of st gregory he lies under a tomb of stone with his image also of stone over him the hair of his head auburn long to his shoulders but curling up and a small forked beard on his head a chaplet like a coronet of roses an habit of purple damasked down to his feet and a collar of gold about his neck under his feet the likeness of three books which he compiled the first named speculum meditantis written in french the second vox clamantis in latin the third confessio amantis in english this last piece was printed by one thomas berthalette and by him dedicated to king henry viii hi vox clamantis with his chronica tripartita and other works both in latin and french stow says he had in his possession but his speculum meditantis he never saw besides on the wall where he lies there were painted three virgins crowned one of

est ubi virtutum regnum sine labe est statum i shall take a quotation from a small piece of his called the envious man and the miser by which it will appear that he was not as winstanley says a refiner of our language but on the other hand that poetry owes him few or no obligations of the envious man and the miser of jupiter thus i find ywrite how whilom that he would wite upon the plaintes which he herd among the men how that it farde as of her wrong condition to do justification and for that cause down he sent an angel which about went that he the sooth know may   besides the works already mentioned our poet wrote the following de compunctione cordi in one book chronicon ricardi secundi ad henricum quartum in one book ad eundem de laud pacis in one book de rege henrico quarto in one book de peste vitiorum in one book scrutinium lucis in one book de regimine principum de conjugii dignitate de amoris varietate   john lydgate commonly called the monk of bury because a native of that place he was another disciple and admirer of chaucer and it must be owned far excelled his master in the article of versification after some time spent in our english universities he traveled through france and italy improving his time to the accomplishment of learning the languages and arts pitseus says he was not only an elegant poet and an eloquent rhetorician but also an expert mathematician a acute philosopher and no mean divine his verses were so very smooth and indeed to a modern ear they appear so that it was said of him by his cotemporaries that his wit was framed and fashioned by the muses themselves after his return from france and italy he became tutor to many noblemens sons and sor his excellent endowments was much esteemed and reverenced by them he writ a poem called the life and death of hector from which i shall give a specimen of his versification i am a monk by my profession in bury called john lydgate by my name and wear a habit of perfection although my life agree not with the same that meddle should with things spiritual as i must needs confess unto you all but seeing that i did herein proceed at k henry v his commands whom i could not refuse i humbly do beseech all those that read or leisure have this story to peruse if any fault therein they find to be or error that committed is by me that they will of their gentleness take pain the rather to correct and mend the same than rashly to condemn it with disdain for well i wot it is not without blame because i know the verse therein is wrong as being some too short and some too long   his prologue to the story of thebes a tale as he says he was constrained to tell at the command of his host of the tabard in southwark whom he found in canterbury with the rest of the pilgrims who went to visit st thomass shrine is remarkably smooth for the age in which he writ this story was first written in latin by chaucer and translated by lydgate into english verse pitseus says he writ partly in prose and partly in verse many exquisite learned books amongst which are eclogues odes and satires he flourished in the reign of henry vi and died in the sixtieth year of his age ann    0 and was buried in his own convent at bury with this epitaph mortuus saeclo superis superstes hic jacet lydgate tumulatus urna qui fuit quondam celebris britannae fama poesis   which is thus rendered into english by winstanly dead in this world living above the sky entombed within this urn does lydgate lie in former times famed for his poetry all over england   john harding john harding the famous english chronologer was born says bale in the northern parts and probably yorkshire being an esquire of an eminent parentage he was a man addicted both to arms and arts in the former of which he seems to have been the greatest proficient his first military exploit was under robert umreuil governor of roxborough castle where he distinguished himself against the scots before which the king of scotland was then encamped and unfortunately lost his life he afterward followed the standard of edward iv to whose interest both in prosperity and distress he honorably adhered but what endeared him most to the favor of that prince and was indeed the masterpiece of his service was his adventuring into scotland and by his courteous insinuating behavior so far ingratiating himself into the favor of their leading men that he procured the privilege of looking into their records and original letters a copy of which he brought to england and presented to the king this successful achievement established him in his princes affections as he was sollicitous to know how often the kings of scotland had taken oaths of fealty and subjected themselves to the english monarchs in order to secure their crown these submissions are warmly disputed by the scotch historians who in honor of their country contend that they were only yielded for cumberland and some parcels of land possessed by them in england south of tweed and indeed when the warlike temper and invincible spirit of that nation is considered it is more than probable that the scotch historians in this particular contend only for truth our author wrote a chronicle in verse of all our english kings from brute to king edward iv for which dr fuller and winstanly bestow great encomiums upon him but he sems to me to be totally destitue of poetry both from the wretchedness of his lines and the unhappiness of his subject a chronicle being of all others the driest and the least susceptible of poetical ornament but let the reader judge by the specimen subjoined he died about the year      being then very aged from gower to barclay it must be observed that kings and princes were constantly the patrons of poets on the magnificent household of king richard ii truly i herd robert irelefe say clark of the green cloth and that to the household came every day forth most part always ten thousand folk by his messes told that followed the house aye as they would and in the ktchen three hundred scruitours and in each office many occupiours and ladies fair with their gentlewomen chamberers also and launderers three hundred of them were occupied then there was great pride among the officers and of all men far passing their compeers of rich arraye and much more costous then was before or since and more precious   john skeleton was born of an ancient family in cumberland he received his education at oxford and entering into holy orders was made rector of dysso in norfolk in the reign of henry viii though more probably he appeared first in that of henry vii and may be said to be the growth of that time that he was a learned man erasmus has confirmed who in his letter to king henry viii styles him britanicarum literarum lumen and decus though his style is rambling and loose yet he was not without invention and his satire is strongly pointed he lived near fourscore years after chaucer but seems to have made but little improvement in versification he wrote some bitter satires against the clergy and particularly his keen reflections on cardinal wolsey drew on him such severe prosecutions that he was obliged to fly for sanctuary to westminster under the protection of islip the abbot where he died in the year      it appears by his poem entitled the crown of laurel that his performances were numerous and such as remain are chiefly these philip sparrow speak parrot the death of king edward iv a treatise of the scots ware the hawk the tunning of elianer rumpkin in these pieces there is a very rich vein of wit and humor though much debased by the rust of the age he lived in his satires are remarkably broad open and illbred the verse cramped by a very short measure and encumbered with such a profusion of rhimes as makes the poet appear almost as ridiculous as those he endeavors to expose in his more serious pieces he is not guilty of this absurdity and confines himself to a regular stanza according to the then reigning mode his bouge of court is a poem of some merit it abounds with wit and imagination and shows him well versed in human nature and the insinuating manners of a court the allegorical characters are finely described and well sustained the fabric of the whole i believe entirely his own and not improbably may have the honor of furnishing a hint even to the inimitable spencer how or by whose interest he was made laureat or whether it was a title he assumed to himself cannot be determined neither is his principal patron any where named but if his poem of the crown laurel before mentioned has any covert meaning he had the happiness of having the ladies for his friends and the countess of surry the lady elizabeth howard and many others united their services in his favor when on his deathbed he was charged with having children by a mistress he kept he protested that in his conscience he kept her in the notion of a wife and such was his cowardice that he chose rather to confess adultery than own marriage a crime at that time more subjected to punishment than the other  the prologue to the bouge court in autumpne when the sun in vyrgyne by

eloquently manners of the court invective against william lyle the grammarian epitaphs on kings princes and nobles collin clout poetical fancies and satires verses on the death of arthur prince of wales   alexander barclay he was an author of some eminence and merit though there are few things preserved concerning him and he has been neglected by almost all the biographers of the poets that excellent writer mrs cooper seems to have a pretty high opinion of his abilities it is certain that he very considerably refined the language and his verses are much smoother than those of harding who wrote but a few years before him he styles himself priest and chaplain in the college of st mary otory in the county of devon and afterward monk of ely his principal work is a translation of a satirical piece written originally in high dutch and entitied the ship of fools it exposes the characters vices and follies of all degrees of men and though much inferior in its execution to the canterbury tales has yet considerable merit especially when it is considered how barren and unpolite the age was in which he flourished in the prologue to this he makes an apology for his youth and it appears that the whole was finished anno dom   0  which was about the close of the reign of henry vii in elegancy of manners he has the advantage of all his predecessors as is particularly remarkable in his address to sir giles alington his patron the poet was now grown old and the knight desiring him to abridge and improve gowers confessio amantis he declines it in the politest manner on account of his age profession and infirmities but though love is an improper subject says he i am still an admirer of the sex and shall introduce to the honor of your acquaintance four of the finest ladies

labor translated from the french into english   bale gives this author but an indifferent character as to his morals he is said to have intrigued with women notwithstanding his clerical profession it is certain he was a gay courtly man and perhaps tho he espoused the church in his profession he held their celebacy and pretended chastity in contempt and being a man of wit indulged himself in those pleasures which seem to be hereditary to the poets  sir thomas more though poetry is none of the excellencies in which this great man was distinguished yet as he wrote some verses with tolerable spirit and was in almost every other respect one of the foremost geniusses our nation ever produced i imagine a short account of his life here will not be disagreable to the readers especially as all biographers of the poets before me have taken notice of him and ranked him amongst the number of bards sir thomas more was born in milkstreet london a d    0 he was son to sir john more knight and one of the justices of the kings bench a man held in the highest esteem at that time for his knowledge in the law and his integrity in the administration of justice it was objected by the enemies of sir thomas that his birth was obscure and his family mean but far otherwise was the real case judge more bore arms from his birth having his coat of arms quartered which proves his having come to his inheritance by descent his mother was likewise a woman of family and of an extraordinary virtue  doctor clement relates from the authority of our author himself a vision which his mother had the next night after her marriage she thought she saw in her sleep as it were engraven in her wedding ring the number and countenances of all the children she was to have of whom the face of one was so dark and obscure that she could not well discern it and indeed she afterward suffered an untimely delivery of one of them the face of the other she beheld shining most gloriously by which the future fame of sir thomas was presignified she also bore two daughters but though this story is told with warmth by his great grandson who writes his life yet as he wa a roman catholic and and disposed to a superstitious belief in miracles and visions there is no great stress to be laid upon it lady more might perhaps communicate this vision to her son and he have embraced the belief of it but it seems to have too little authority to deserve credit from posterity  another miracle is related by stapleton which is said to have happened in the infancy of more his nurse one day crossing a river and her horse stepping into a deep place exposed both her and the child to great danger she being more anxious for the safety of the child than her own threw him over a hedge into a field adjoining and escaping likewise from the imminent danger when she came to take him up she found him quite unhurt and smiling sweetly upon her  he was put to the free school in london called st anthonys under the care of the famous nicholas holt and when he had with great rapidity acquired a knowledge of his grammar rules he was placed by his fathers interest under the great cardinal merton archbishop of canterbury and lord high chancellor whose gravity and learning generosity and tenderness allured all men to love and honor him to him more dedicated his utopia which of all his works is unexceptionably the most masterly and finished the cardinal finding himself too much incumbered with business and hurried with state affairs to superintend his education placed him in canterbury college in oxford where by his assiduous application to books his extraordinary temperance and vivacity of wit he acquired the first character among the students and then gave proos of a genius that would one day make a great blaze in the world when he was but eighteen years old such was the sorce of his understanding he wrote many epigrams which were highly esteemed by men of eminence as well abroad as at home beatus rhenanus in his epistle to bilibalus pitchemerus passes great encomiums upon them as also leodgarius a quercu public reader of humanity at paris one brixius a german who enved the reputation of this young epigramatist wrote a book against these epigrams under the title of antimorus which had no other effect than drawing erasmus into the field who celebrated and honored more whose high patronage was the greatest compliment the most ambitious writer could expect so that the friendship of erasmus was cheapl purchased by the malevolence of a thousand such critics as brixius about the same time of life he translated for his exercise one of lucians orations out of greek into latin which he calls his rst fruits of the greek tongue and adds another oration of his own to answer that of lucian for as he had defended him who had slain a tyrant he opposed against it another with such forcible arguments that it seems not to be inferior to lucians either in invention or eloquence when he was about twenty years old finding his appetites and passions very predominant he struggled with all the heroism of a christian against their influence and inflicted severe whippings and austere mortifications upon himself every friday and on high fasting days lest his sensuality should grow too insolent and at last subdue his reason but notwithstanding all his efforts finding his lusts ready to endanger his soul he wisely determined to marry a remedy much more natural than personal inflictions and as a pattern of life he proposed the example of a singular layman john picus earl of mirandula who was a man famous for chastity virtue and learning he translated this noblemans life as also many of his letters and his twelve receipts of good life which are extant in the beginning of his english works for this end he also wrote a treatise of the four last things which he did not quite finish being called to other studies  at his meals he was very abstemious norever eat but of one dish which was most commonly powdered beef or some such salt meat in his youth he abstained wholly from wine and as he was temperate in his diet so was he heedless and negligent in his apparel being once told by his secretary mr harris that his shoes were all torn he bad him tell his man to buy him new ones whose business it was to take care of his clothes whom for this cause he called his tutor his first wifes name was jane cole descended of a genteel family who bore him four children and upon her decease which in not many years happened he married a second time a widow one mrs alice middleton by whom he had no children this he says he did not to indulge his passions for he observes that it it harder to keep chastiy in wedlock than in a single life but to take care of his children and household affairs upon what principle this observation is founded i cannot well conceive and wish sir thomas had given his reasons why it is harder to be chaste in a married than single life this wife was a worldly minded woman had a very indifferent person was advanced in years and possessed no very agreeable temper much about this time he became obnoxious to henry vii for opposing his exactions upon the people henry was a covetous mean prince and entirely devoted to the council of emson and dudley who then were very justly reckoned the caterpillars of the state the king demanded a large subsidy to bestow on his eldest daughter who was then about to be married to james iv of scotland sir thomas being one of the burgesses so influenced the lower house by the force of his arguments who were cowardly enough before not to oppose the king that they refused the demands upon which mr tiler of the kings privychambers went presently to his majesty and told him that more had disappointed all their expectations which circumstance not a little enraged him against more upon this henry was base enough to pick a quarrel without a cause against sir john more his venerable father and in revenge to the son clapped him in the tower keeping him there prisoner till he had forced him to pay one hundred pounds of a fine for no offense king henry soon after dying his son who began his reign with some popular acts though afterward he degenerated into a monstrous tyrant caused dudley and emson to be impeached of high treason for giving bad advice to his father and however illegal such an arraignment might be yet they met the just fate of oppressors and traitors to their country  about the year      he composed his famous book called the utopia and gained by it great reputation soon after it was published it was translated both into french and italian dutch and english dr stapleton enumerates the opinions of a great many learned men in its favor this work though not writ in verse yet in regard of the fancy and invention employed in composing it may well enough pass for an allegorical poem it contains the idea of a complete commonwealth in an imaginary sland pretended to be lately discovered in america and that so well counterfeited that many upon reading it mistook it for a real truth in so much says winstanly that some learned men as budeus johannes plaudanus out of a principle of frvent zeal wished that some excellent divines might be sent hither to preach christs gospel  much about the same time he wrote the history of richard iii which was likewise held in esteem these works were undertaken when he was discharged from the business of the state  roper in his life of our author relates that upon an occasion in which king henry viii and the pope were parties in a cause tried in the star chamber sir thomas most remarkably distinguished himself and became so great a favorite with that discerning monarch that he could no longer forbear calling him into his service  a ship of the popes by the violence of a storm was driven into southampton which the king claimed as a forfeiture when the day of hearing came on before the lord high chancellor and other judges more argued so forcibly in favor of the pope that though the judges had resolved to give it for the king yet they altered their opinion and confirmed the popes right in a short time after this he was created a knight and after the death of mr weston he was made treasurer of the exchequer and one of the privy council he was now speaker of the house of commons and thus exalted in dignity the eyes of the nation were fixed upon him wolsey who then governed the realm found himself much grieved by the burgesses because all their transactions were so soon made public and wanting a fresh subsidy came to the house in person to complain of this usage when the burgesses heard of his coming it was long debated whether they should admit him or no and sir thomas strongly urged that he should be admitted for this reason that if he shall find fault with the spreading of our secrets says he we may lay the blame upon those his grace brought with him the proud churchman having entered the house made a long speech for granting the subsidy and asked several of the members opinion concerning it they were all so confounded as not to be able to answer and the house at last resolved that their speaker should reply for them upon this sir thomas showed that the cardinals coming into the house was unprecedented illegal and a daring insult on the liberty of the burgesses and that the subsidy demanded was unnecessary upon which wolsey suddenly departed in a rage and ever after entertained suspicions of more and became jealous of his great abilities our authors fame was not confined to england only all the scholars and statesmen in every country in europe had heard of and corresponded with him but of all strangers he had a peculiar esteem for erasmus who took a journey into england in order to converse with him and enter more minutely into the merit of one whose learning he had so high an opinion of they agreed to meet first at my lord mayors table and as they were personally unknown to make the experiment whether they could discover one another by conversation they met accordingly and remained some hours undiscovered at last an argument was started in which both engaged with great keenness erasmus designedly defended the unpopular side but finding himself so strongly pressed that he could hold it no longer he broke out in an ecstasy aut tu es morus aut nullus upon which more replied aut tu es erasmus aut diabolus as at that time erasmus was striving to defend very impious propositions in order to put his antagonists strength to the proof  when he lived in the city of london as a justice of peace he used to attend the sessions at newgate there was then upon the bench a venerable old judge who was very severe against those who had their purses cut as the phrase then was and told them that it was by their negligence that so many pursecutters came before him sir thomas who was a great lover of a joke contrived to have this judges purse cut from him in the sessions house by a felon when the felon was arraigned he told the court that if he were permitted to speak to one of the judges in private he could clear his innocence to them they indulged him in his request and he made choice of this old judge and while he whispered something in his ear he slily cut away his purse the judge returned to the bench and the felon made a sign to sir thomas of his having accomplished the scheme sir thomas moved the court that each of them should bestow some alms on a needy person who then stood falsely accused and was a real object of compassion the motion was agreed to and when the old man came to put his hand in his purse he was astonished to find it gone and told the court that he was sure he had it when he came there what says more in a pleasant manner do you charge any of us with felony the judge beginning to be angry our facetious author desired the felon to return his purse and advised the old man never to be so bitter against innocent mens negligence when he himself could not keep his purse safe in that open assembly  although he lived a courtier and was much concerned in business yet he never neglected his family at home but instructed his daughters in all useful learning and conversed familiarly with them he was remarkably fond of his eldest daughter margaret as she had a greater capacity and sprightlier genius than the rest his children often used to translate out of latin into english and out of english into latin and dr stapleton observes that he has seen an apology of sir thomas mores to the university of oxford in defense of learning turned into latin by one of his daughters and translated again into english by another margaret whose wit was superior to the rest writ a treatise on the four last things which sir thomas declared was finer than his she composed several orations especially one in answer to quintilian defending a rich man which he accused for having poisoned a poor mans bees with certain venomous flowers in his garden so eloquent and forcible that it may justly rival quintilian himself she also translated eusebius out of greek  though sir thomas was thus involved in public affairs and domestic concerns yet he found leisure to write many books either against heretics or of a devotional cast for at that time what he reckoned heresy began to diffuse itself over all germany and flanders he built a chapel in his parish church at chelsea which he constantly attended in the morning so steady was he in his devotion he hired a house also for many aged people in the parish which he turned into an hospital and supported at his own expense he at last rose to the dignity of lord high chancellor upon the fall of wolsey and while he sat as the chief judge of the nation in one court his father aged upwards of  0 sat as chief justice in the kings bench a circumstance which never before nor ever since happened of a father being a judge and his son a chancellor at the same time every day as the chancellor went to the bench he kneeled before his father and asked his blessing the people soon found the difference between the intolerable pride of wolsey and the gentleness and humility of more he permitted every one to approach him without reserve he dispatched business with great assiduity and so cleared the court of tedious suits that he more than once came to the bench and calling for a cause there was none to try as no dignity could inspire him with pride so no application to the most important affairs could divert him from sallies of humor and a pleasantry of behavior it once happened that a beggars little dog which she had lost was presented to lady more of which she was very fond but at last the beggar getting notice where the dog was she came to complain to sir thomas as he was sitting in his hall that his lady withheld her dog from her presently my lady was sent for and the dog brought with her which he taking in his hand caused his wife to stand at the upper end of the hall and the beggar at the other he then bad each of them call the dog which when they did the dog went presently to the beggar forsaking my lady when he saw this he bad my lady be contented for it was none of hers my lord chancellor then gave the woman a piece of gold which would have bought ten such dogs and bid her be careful of it for the future  a friend of his had spent much time in composing a book and went to sir thomas to have his opinion of it he desired him to turn it into rhyme which at the expense of many years labor he at last accomplished and came again to have his opinion yea marry says he now it is somewhat now it is rhyme but before it was neither rhyme nor reason  but fortune which had been long propitious to our author began now to change sides and try him as well with affliction as prosperity in both which characters his behavior integrity and courage were irreproachable the amorous monarch king henry viii at last obtained from his parliament and council a divorce from his lawful wife and being passionately fond of anna bullen he marred her and declared her queen of england this marriage sir thomas had always opposed and held it unlawful for his sovereign to have another wife during his first wifes life the queen who was of a petulant disposition and elated with her new dignity could not withhold her resentment against him but animated all her relations and the parties inclined to the protestant interest to persecute him with rigor not long after the divorce the council gave authority for the publication of a book in which the reasons why this divorce was granted were laid down an answer was soon published with which sir thomas more was charged as the author of which report however he sufficiently cleared himself in a letter to mr cromwell then secretary and a great favorite with king henry in the parliament held in the year      there was an oath framed called the oath of supremacy in which all english subjects should renounce the popes authority and swear also to the succession of queen anns children and lady mary illegitimate this oath was given to all the clergy as well bishops as priests but no layman except sir thomas more was desired to take it he was summoned to appear at lambeth before archbishop cranmer the lord chancellor audley mr secretary cromwell and the abbot of westminster appointed commissioners by the king to tender this oath more absolutely refused to take it from a principle of conscience and after various expostulations he was ordered into the custody of the abbot of westminster and soon after he was sent to the tower and the lieutenant had strict charge to prevent his writing or holding conversation with any persons but those sent by the secretary the lord chancellor duke of norfolk and mr cromwell paid him frequent visits and pressed him to take the oath which he still refused about a year after his commitment to the tower by the importunity of queen ann he was arrignd at the kings bench bar for obstinately refusing the oath of supremacy and wilfully and obstinately opposing the kings second marriage he went to the court leaning on his staff because he had been much weakened by his imprisonment his judges were audley lord chancellor fitz james chief justice sir john baldwin sir richard leister sir john port sir john spelman sir walter luke sir anthony fitzherbert the kings attorney opened against him with a very opprobious libel the chief evidence were mr secretary cromwell to whom he had uttered some disrepectful expressions of the kings authority the duke of suffolk and earl of wiltshire he replied to the accusation with great composure and strength of argument and when one mr rich swore against him he boldly asserted that rich was perjured and wished he might never see gods countenance in mercy if what he asserted was not true besides that rich added to perjury the baseness of betraying private conversation but notwithstanding his defense the jury who were composed of creatures of the court brought in their verdict guilty and he had sentence of death pronounced against him which he heard without emotion he then made a long speech addressed to the chancellor and observed to mr rich that he was more sorry for his perjury than for the sentence that had just been pronounced against him rich had been sent by the secretary to take away all sir thomass books and papers during which time some conversation passed which rich misrepresented in order to advance himself in the kings favor he was ordered again to the tower till the kings pleasure should be known when he landed at tower wharf his favorite daughter margaret who had not seen him since his confinement came there to take her last adieu and forgetting the bashfulness and delicacy of her sex pressed through the multitude threw her arms about her fathers neck and often embraced him they had but little conversation and their parting was so moving that all the spectators dissolved in tears and applauded the affection and tenderness of the lady which could enable her to take her farewell under so many disadvantages  some time after his condemnation mr secretary cromwell waited on sir thomas and entreated him to accept his majestys pardon upon the condition of taking the oath and expressed great tenderness toward him this visit and seeming friendship of cromwell not a little affected him he revolved in his mind the proposal which he made and as his fate was approaching perhaps his resolution staggered a little but calling to mind his former vows his cnscience his honor he recovered himself again and stood firmly prepared for his sall upon this occasion it was that he wrote the following verses mentioned both by mr roper and mr hoddeson which i shall here insert as a specimen of his poetry ey flattering fortune look thou never so fair or never so pleasantly begin to smile as though thou would my ruin all repair during my life thou shall not me begile trust shall i god to enter in a while his haven of heaven sure and uniforme ever after thy calm look i for a storm   on the  th of july      in the   th year of his age the sentence of condemnation was executed upon him on tower hill by severing his head from his body as he was carried to the scaffold some low people hired by his enemies cruelly insulted him to whom he gave cool and effectual answers being now under the scaffold he looked at it with great calmness and observing it too slenderly built he said merrily to mr lieutenant i pray you sir see me safe up and for my coming down let me shift for myself when he mounted on the scaffold he threw his eyes round the multitude desired them to pray for him and to bear him witness that he died for the holy catholic church a faithful servant both to god and the king his gaiety and propension to jesting did not forsake him in his last moments when he laid his head upon the block he bad the executioner stay till he had removed aside his beard saying that that had never committed treason when the executioner asked his forgiveness he kissed him and said thou will do me this day a greater benefit than any mortal man can be able to give me pluck up thy spirit man and be not afraid to do thy office my neck is very short take heed therefore that thou strike not awry for saving thy honesty  thus by an honest but mistaken zeal fell sir thomas more a man of wit and parts superior to all his cotemporaries of integrity unshaken of a generous and noble disposition of a courage intrepid a great scholar and a devout christian wood says that he was but an indifferent divine and that he was very ignorant of antiquity and the learning of the fathers but he allows him to be a man of a pleasant and fruitful imagination and a statesman beyond any that succeeded him  his works besides those we have already mentioned are chiefly these a merry jest how a sergeant

of the peers had fastened upon the one they took care that the other should not escape he was the first nobleman says camden that illustrated his high birth with the beauty of learning he was acknowledged by all to be the gallantest man the politest lover and the most complete gentleman of his time he received his education at windsor with a natural son of henry viii and became first eminent for his devotion to the beautiful geraldine maid of honor to queen catherine she first inspired him with poetry and that poetry has conferred immortality on her so transported was he with his passion that he made a tour to the most elegant courts in europe to maintain her peerless beauty against all opposers and every where made good his challenge with honor in his way to florence he touched at the emperors court where he became acquainted with the learned cornelius agrippa so famous for magic who showed him the image of his geraldine in a glass sick weeping on her bed and melting into devotion for the absence of her lord upon sight of this he wrote the following passionate sonnet which for the smoothness of the verse the tenderness of expression and the heartfelt sentiments might do honor to the politest easiest most passionate poet in our own times all soul no earthly flesh why do thou fade all gold no earthly dross why look thou pale sickness how dare thou one so fair invade too base infirmity to work her bale heaven be distempered since she grieved pines never be dry these my sad plaintive lines perch thou my spirit on her silver breasts and with their pains redoubled music beatings let them toss thee to world where all toil rests where bliss is subject to no fears defeatings her praise i tune whose tongue does tune the spheres and gets new muses in her hearers ears stars fall to fetch fresh light from the rich eyes her bright brow drives the sun to clouds beneath her hair reflex with red strakes paints the skies sweet morn and evening dew flows from her breath phoebe rules tides she my tears tides forth draws in her sick bed love sits and makes laws her dainty lips tinsel her silksoft sheets her rosecrownd cheeks eclipse my dazzled sight o glass with too much joy my thoughts thou greets and yet thou show me day but by twilight i will kiss thee for the kindness i have felt her lips one kiss would into nectar melt   from the emperors court he went to the city of florence the pride and glory of italy in which city his beauteous geraldine was born and he had no rest till he found out the house of her nativity and being shown the room where his charmer first drew air he was transported with ecstasy of joy his tongue overflowed with her praises and winstanly says he eclipsed the sun and moon with comparisons of his geraldine and wrote another sonnet in praise of the chamber that was honored as he says with her radiant conception this sonnet is equally amorous and spirited with that already inserted in the duke of florences court he published a proud challenge against all comers whether christians turks canibals jews or saracens in defense of his mistresss beauty this challenge was the better received there as she whom he defended was born in that city the duke of florence however sent for him and enquired of his fortune and the intent of his coming to his court of which when the earl informed him he granted to all countries whatever as well enemies and outlaws as friends and allies free access into his dominions unmolested till the trial were ended  in the course of his combats for his mistress his valor and skill in arms so engaged the duke to his interest that he offered him the highest preferments if he would remain at his court this proposal he rejected as he intended to proceed through all the chief cities in italy but his design was frustrated by letters sent by king henry viii which commanded his speedy return into england  in the year      upon the expedition to boulogne in france he was made field marshal of the english army and after taking that town being then knight of the garter he was in the beginning of september      constituted the kings lieutenant and captain general of all his army within the town and county of boulogne dugdales baronage  during his command there in      hearing that a convoy of provisions of the enemy was coming to the fort at oultreaw he resolved to intercept it but the rhinegrave with four thousand lanskinets together with a considerable number of french under the de bieg making an obstinate defense the english were routed sir edward poynings with diverse other gentlemen killed and the earl himself obliged to fly though it appears by a letter to the king dated january        that this advantage cost the enemy a great number of men but the king was so highly displeased with this ill success that from that time he contracted a prejudice against the earl and soon after removed him from his command and appointed the earl of hertford to succeed him upon which sir william page wrote to the earl of surry to advise him to procure some eminent post under the earl of hertford that he might not be unprovided in the town and field the earl being desirous in the mean time to regain his former favor with the king skirmished with the french and routed them but soon after writing over to the kings council that as the enemy had cast much larger cannon than had been yet seen with which they imagined they should soon demolish boulogne it deserved consideration whether the lower town should stand as not being defensible the council ordered him to return to england in order to represent his sentiments more fully upon those points and the earl of hertford was immediately sent over in his room this exasperating the earl of surry occasioned him to let fall some expressions which savoured of revenge and dislike to the king and a hatred of his counselors and was probably one cause of his ruin which soon after ensued the duke of norfolk who discovered the growing power of the seymours and the influence they were likely to bear in the next reign was for making an alliance with them he therefore presed his son to marry the earl of hertfords daughter and the duchess of richmond his own daughter to marry sir thomas seymour but neither of these matches were effected and the seymours and howards then became open enemies the seymours failed not to inspire the king with an aversion to the norfolkfamily whose power they dreaded and represented the ambitious views of the earl of surry but to return to him as a poet  that celebrated antiquary john leland speaking of sir thomas wyat the elder calls the earl the conscript enrolled heir of the said sir thomas in his learning and other excellent qualities the author of a treatise entitled the art of english poetry alleges that sir thomas wyat the elder and henry earl of surry were the two chieftains who having traveled into italy and there tasted the sweet and stately measures and style of the italian poetry greatly polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poetry from what it had been before and therefore may be justly called the reformers of our english poetry and style our noble author added to learning wisdom fortitude munificence and affability yet all these excellencies of character could not prevent his falling a sacrifice to the jealousy of the peers or as some say to the resentment of the king for his attempting to wed the princess mary and by these means to raise himself to the crown history is silent as to the reasons why the gallantries he performed for geraldine did not issue in a marriage perhaps the reputation he acquired by arms might have enflamed his soul with a love of glory and this conjecture seems the more probable as we find his ambition prompting him to make love to the princess from no other views but those of dominion he married frances daughter to john earl of oxford after whose death he addressed princess mary and his first marriage perhaps might be owing to a desire of strengthening his interest and advancing his power in the realm the adding some part of the royal arms to his own was also made a pretense against him but in this he was justified by the heralds as he proved that a power of doing so was granted by some preceding monarchs to his foresathers upon the strength of these suspicions and surmises he and his father were committed to the tower of london the one by water the other by land so that they knew not of each others apprehension the fifteenth day of january next following he was arraigned at guildhall where he was found guilty by twelve common jurymen and received judgment about nine days before the death of the king he lost his head on tower hill and had not that monarchs decease so soon ensued the fate of his father was likewise determined to have been the same with his sons  it is said when a courtier asked king henry why he was so zealous in taking off surry i observed him says he an enterprizing youth his spirit was too great to brook subjection and though i can manage him yet no successor of mine will ever be able to do so for which reason i have dispatched him in my own time  he was first interred in the chapel of the tower and afterward in the reign of king james his remains were removed to farmingam in suffolk by his second son henry earl of northampton with this epitaph henrico howardo thomae secundi ducis norfolciae filio primogenito thomae tertii patri comiti surriae and georgiani ordinis equiti aurato immature anno salutis      abrepto et franciscae uxoris ejus filiae johannis comitis oxoniae henricus howardus comes northamptoniae filius secundo genitus hoc supremum pietatis in parents monumentum posuit a d       upon the accession of queen mary the attainder was taken off his father which circumstance has furnished some people with an opportunity to say that the princess was fond of and would have married the earl of surry i shall transcribe the act of repeal as i find it in collinss peerage of england which has something singular enough in it  that there was no special matter in the act of attainder but only general words of treason and conspiracy and that out of their care for the preservation of the king and the prince they passed it and this act of repeal further sets forth that the only thing of which he stood charged was for bearing of arms which he and his ancestors had born within and without the kingdom in the kings presence and sight of his progenitors as they might lawfully bear and give as by good and substantial matter of record it did appear it also added that the king died after the date of the commission likewise that he only empowered them to give his consent but did not give it himself and that it did not appear by any record that they gave it moreover that the king did not sign the commission with his own hand his stamp being only set to it and that not to the upper part but to the nether part of it contrary to the kings custom  besides the amorous and other poetical pieces of this noble author he translated virgils aeneid and rendered says wood the first second and third book almost word for word  all the biographers of the poets have been lavish and very justly in his praise he merits the highest encomiums as the refiner of our language and challenges the gratitude and esteem of every man of literature for the generous assistance he afforded it in its infancy and his ready and liberal patronage to all men of merit in his time  sir thomas wyat was distinguished by the appellation of the elder as there was one of the same name who raised a rebellion in the time of queen mary he was son to henry wyat of alingtoncastle in kent he received the rudiments of his education at cambridge and was afterward placed at oxford to finish it he was in great esteem with king henry viii on account of his wit and love elegies pieces of poetry in which he remarkably succeeded the affair of anne bullen came on when he made some opposition to the kings passion for her that was likely to prove fatal to him but by his prudent behavior and retracting what he had formerly advanced he was restored again to his royal patroage he was cotemporary with the earl of surry who held him in high esteem he travlled into foreign parts and as we have observed in the earl of surrys life he added something toward refining the english style and polishing our numbers though he seems not to have done so much in that way as his lordship pitts and bale have entirely neglected him yet for his translation of davids pialms into english meter and other poetical works leland scruples not to compare him with dante and petrarch by giving him this ample commendation let florence fair her dantes justly boast and royal rome her petrarchs numbered feet in english wyat both of them does coast in whom all graceful eloquence does meet   leland published all his works under the title of naenia some of his biographers mrs cooper and winstanley say that he died of the plague as he was going on an embassy to the emperor charies v but wood asserts that he was only sent to palmo by the king to meet the spanish ambassador on the road and conduct him to the court which it seems demanded very great expedition that by overfatiguing himself he was thrown into a fever and in the thirtyeighth year of his age died in a little countrytown in england greatly lamented by all lovers of learning and politeness in his poetical capacity he does not appear to have much imagination neither are his verses so musical and well polished as lord surrys those of gallantry in particular seem to be too artificial and labored for a lover without that artless simplicity which is the genuine mark of feeling and too stiff and negligent of harmony for a his letters to john poynes and sir francis bryan deserve more notice they argue him a man of great sense and honor a critical observer of manners and wellqualified for an elegant and genteel satirist these letters contain observations on the courtiers life and i shall quote a few lines as a specimen by which it will be seen how much he falls short of his noble cotemporary lord surry and is above those writers that preceded him in versification the courtiers life in court to serve decked with fresh array of sugared meats feling the sweet repast the life in blankets and sundry kinds of play amidst the press the worldly looks to waste has with it joined often such bitter taste that whosoever joys such kind of life to hold in prison joys fettered with chains of gold   thomas sackville earl dorset was son of richard sackville and winifrede daughter of sir john bruges lord mayor of london fullers worthies p  0  he was born at buckhurst in the parish of withiam in sussex and from his childhood was distinguished for wit and manly behavior he was first of the university of oxford but taking no degree there he went to cambridge and commenced master of arts he afterward studied the law in the inner temple and became a barrister but his genius being too lively to be confined to a dull plodding study he chose rather to dedicate his hours to poetry and pleasure he was the first that wrote scenes in verse the tragedy of ferrex and perrex sons to gorboduc king of britain being performed in the presence of queen elizabeth long before shakespeare appeared wood ath ox praed on the stage by the gentlemen of the inner temple at whitehall the   th of january      which sir philip sidney thus characterises it is full of stately speeches and well sounding phrases climbing to the height of senecas style and as full of notable morality which it does most delightfully teach and so obtain the very end of poetry in the course of his studies he was most delighted with the history of his own country and being likewise well acquainted with ancient history he med a design of writing the lives of several great personages in verse of which we have a specimen in a book published    0 called the mirror of magistrates being a true chronicle history of the untimely falls of such unfortunate princes and men of note as have happened since the first entrance of brute into this island until his own time it appears by a preface of richard nicolls that the original plan of the mirror of magistrates was principally owing to him a work of great labor use and beauty the induction from which i shall quote a few lines is indeed a masterpiece and if the whole could have been completed in the same manner it would have been an honor to the nation to this day nor could have sunk under the ruins of time but the courtier put an end to the poet and one cannot help wishing for the sake of our national reputation that his rise at court had been a little longer delayed it may easily be seen that allegory was brought to great perfection before the appearance of spencer and if mr sackville did not surpass him it was because he had the disadvantage of writing first agreeable to what tasso exclaimed on seeing guarinis pastor fido if he had not seen my aminta he had not excelled it  our authors great abilities being distinguished at court he was called to public affairs in the th and  th years of queen mary we find him in parliament in the  th year of elizabeth when his father was chosen for sussex he was returned one of the knights of buckinghamshire to the parliament then held he afterward traveled into foreign parts and was detained for some time prisoner at rome his return into england being procured in order to take possession of the vast inheritance his father left him he was knighted by the duke of norfolk in her majestys presence collinss peerage          and at the same day advanced to the degree and dignity of a baron of this realm by the title of lord buckhurst he was of so profuse a temper that though he then enjoyed a great estate yet by his magnificent way of living he spent more than the income of it and ib     a story is told of him that calling on an alderman of london who had got very considerably by the loan of his money to him he was obliged to wait his coming down so long as made such an impression on his generous humor that thereupon he turned a thrifty improver of his estate but others make him the convert of queen elizabeth to whom he was allied his grandfather having married a lady related to ann bullen who by her frequent admonitions diverted the torrent of his profusion and then received him into her particular favor camden says that in the   th of that princess he was sent ambassador to charles ix king of france to congratulate his marriage with the emperor maximilians daughter and on other important affairs where he was honorably received according to his queens merit and his own and having in company guido cavalcanti a gentleman of florence a person of great experience and the queen mother being a florentine a treaty of marriage was publicly transacted between queen elizabeth and her son the duke of anjou in the   th of her majesty he was one of the peers rapins history of england p     that sat on the trial of thomas howard duke of norfolk the nobleman suffered death for a plot to recover the liberty of the queen of scots and on the   th of elizabeth was nominated one of the commissioners for the trial of mary queen of scots and at that time was of the privy council but his lordship is not mentioned amongst the peers who met at fotheringay castle and condemned the queen yet when the parliament had confirmed the sentence he was made choice of to convey the news to her majesty and see their determination put in execution against that beauteous princess possibly because he was a man of fine accomplishments and tenderness of disposition and could manage so delicate a point with more address than any other courtier in the succeeding year he was sent ambassador to the states of the united provinces upon their dislike of the earl of leicesters proceedings in a great many respects there to examine the business and compose the difference he faithfully discharged this invidious office but thereby incurred the earl of leicesters displeasure who prevailed with the queen as he was her favorite to call the lord buckhurst home and confine him to his house for nine months but surviving that earl the queens favor returned and he was elected the april following without his knowledge one of the knights of the most noble order of the garter he was one of the peers that sat on the trial of philip howard earl of arundel in the  th year of the queens reign he was joined with the lord treasurer burleigh in promoting a peace with spain in which trust he was so successful that the high admiral of holland was sent over by the states of the united provinces to renew their treaty with the crown of england being afraid of its union with spain lord buckhurst had the sole management of that negotiation as burleigh then lay sick and concluded a treaty with him by which his mistress was eased of no less than   0000 l per annum besides other advantages  his lordship succeeded sir christopher hatton in the chancellorship of the university of oxford in opposition to robert devereux earl of essex master of the horse to the queen who a little before was incorporated master of arts in the said university to capacitate him for that office but on receipt of letters from her majesty in favor of lord buckhurst the academicians elected him chancellor on the   th of december following on the death of lord burleigh the queen considering the great services he had done his country which had cost him immense expenses was pleased to constitute him in the   st year of her reign lord high treasurer of england in the succeeding year      he was in commission with sir thomas egerton lord chancellor and the earl of essex earlmarshal for negotiating affairs with the senate of denmark as also in a special commission for suppressing schism and afterward when libels were dispersed by the earl of essex and his faction against the queen intimating that her majesty took little care of the government and altogether neglected the state of ireland rapins history of england volii p     his lordship engaged in a vindication of her majesty and made answers to these libels representing how brave and well regulated an army had been sent into ireland completely furnished with all manner of provisions and likewise that her majesty had expended on that war in six months time the sum of  00000 l which lord essex must own to be true he suspected that earls mutinous designs by a greater concourse of people resorting to his house than ordinary and sent his son to pay him a visit rapins history of england vol ii p   0 and to desire him to be careful of the company he kept essex being sensible that his scheme was already discovered by the penetrating eye of lord buckhurst he and his friends entered upon new measures and breaking out into an open rebellion were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners when that unfortunate favorite together with the earl of southampton was brought to trial lord buckhurst was constituted on that occasion lord high steward of england and passing sentence on the earl of essex his lordship in a very eloquent speech desired him to implore the queens mercy after this it being thought necessary for the safety of the nation that some of the leading conspirators should suffer death his lordship advised her majesty to pardon the rest upon this he had a special commission granted him together with secretary cecil and the earl of nottingham lord high admiral to call before them all such as were concerned in the conspiracy with the earls of essex and southampton and to treat and compound with such offenders for the redemption and composition of their lands after the death of queen elizabeth his lordship was concerned in taking the necessary measures for the security of the kingdom the administration being devolved on him and other counselors who unanimously proclaimed king james and signed a letter march      0  to the lord eure and the rest of the commissioners for the treaty of breme notifying her majestys decease and the recognition and proclamation of king james of scotland who had such a sense of lord buckhursts services and superior abilities that before his arrival in england he ordered the renewal of his patent as lord high treasurer for life on the   th of march next ensuing he was created earl of dorset and constituted one of the commissioners for executing the office of earlmarshal of england and for reforming sundry abuses in the college of arms  in the year   0  this great man died suddenly at the council table whitehall after a bustling life devoted to the public weal and the   th of may following his remains were deposited with great solemnity in westminster abbey his funeral sermon being preached by dr abbot his chaplain afterward archbishop of canterbury besides this celebrated sermon of the primates in which he is very lavish in his praise lord chancellor bacon and sir robert naunton bestow particular encomiums upon him and sir richard baker observes that he had excellent parts and in his place was exceeding industrious and that he had heard many exchequer men say there never was a better treasurer both for the kings profit and the good of the subject  by his dying suddenly at the council table his death was interpreted by some people in a mysterious manner chron  d edit p     but his head being opened there were found in it certain little bags of water which whether by straining in his study the night before in which he sat up till    oclock or otherwise by their own maturity suddenly breaking and falling upon his brain produced his death to the universal grief of the nation for which he had spent his strength and for whose interest in a very immediate manner he may be justly said to have fallen a sacrifice of all our court poets he seems to have united the greatest industry and variety of genius it is seldom found that the sons of parnassus can devote themselves to public business or execute it with success i have already observed that the world has lost many excellent works which no doubt this cultivated genius would have accomplished had he been less involved in courtaffairs but as he acted in so public a sphere and discharged every office with inviolable honor and consummate prudence it is perhaps somewhat selfish in the lovers of poetry to wish he had wrote more and acted less from him is descended the present noble family of the dorsets and it is remarkable that all the descendants of this great man have inherited his taste for liberal arts and sciences as well as his capacity for public business an heir of his was the friend and patron of dryden and is styled by congreve the monarch of wit in his time and the present age is happy in his illustrious posterity rivalling for deeds of honor and renown the most famous of their ancestors  induction to the mirror of magistrates the wrathful winter hastening on apace with

assistants in the mirror of magistrates he was born in the town of shrewsbury winst    as himself affirms in his book made in verse of the worthiness of wales he was equally addicted to arts and arms he had a liberal education and inherited some fortune real and personal but he soon exhausted it in a tedious and unfruitful attendance at court for he gained no other equivalent for that mortifying dependence but the honor of being retained a domestic in the family of lord surry during which time by his lordships encouragement he commenced poet upon his masters death he betook himself to arms was in many engagements and was frequently wounded he was twice a prisoner and redeemed by the charity of two noble ladies yet still languishing in distress and bitterly complaining of fortune neither of his employments afforded him a patron who would do justice to his obscure merit and unluckily he was as unhappy in his amors as in his circumstances some of his mistresses treating his addresses with contempt perhaps on account of his poverty for though it generally happens that poets have the greatest power in courtship as they can celebrate their mistresses with more elegance than people of any other profession yet it very seldom falls out that they marry successfully as their needy circumstances naturally deter them from making advances to ladies of such fashion as their genius and manners give them a right to address this proved our authors case exactly he made love to a widow named browning who possessed a very good jointure but this lady being more in love with money than laurels with wealth than merit rejected his suit which not a little discouraged him as he had spent his money in hopes of effecting this match which to his great mortification all his rhimes and sonnets could not do he dedicated his works to sir christopher hatton but addresses of that nature dont always imply a provision for their author it is conjectured that he died about the eleventh year of queen elizabeth and according to mr wood was buried near skeleton in the chancel of st margarets westminster by his writings he appears a man of sense and sometimes a poet though he does not seem to possess any degree of invention his language is generally pure and his numbers not wholly inharmonious the legend of jane shore is the most finished of all his works from which i have taken a

was styled civis londinensis yet he laid a foundation of learning at oxford but the severity of an academical life not suiting with his airy genius he retired to his native place and had the honor to have a great intimacy with sir thomas more it is said that he had admirable skill both in instrumental and vocal music but it is not certain whether he left any compositions of that sort behind him he

a poet he received his education at the university of oxford but of what college he was wood himself has not been able to discover he removed from thence to lincolnsinn where by a diligent application

the bar he was the menial servant of king henry viii biog brit p      and discharged his trust both in time of war and peace with great honor and gallantry and shared that monarchs favor in a very considerable degree who made him a grant in his own country as an evidence of his affection for him this grant of the kings happened in the year      and yet in seven years afterward either through want of economy or by a boundless confidence in his friends he reduced his affairs to a very indifferent situation which perhaps might be the reason why he procured himself to be chosen member for the borough of plymouth in the county of devon willis notitia parliam vol   p     in the parliament summoned the thirtythird year of that kings reign during the sessions he had the misfortune to be arrested by an officer belonging to the sheriffs of london and carried to the counter then in breadsteet no sooner had the house of commons got notice of this insult offered to one of their members than they immediately enacted a settled rule which from that accident took place with respect to privilege and ever sice that time the members of the house have been exempt from arrests for debt his majesty likewise resented the affront offered to his servant and with the concurrence of the parliament proceeded very severely against the sheriffs  hollinshed in his chronicle vol   p     gives a very full account of it sir thomas moils knight then speaker of the house gave a special order to the sergeant of the parliament to repair to the compter and there demand the delivery of the prisoner but notwithstanding this high authority the officers in the city refused to obey the command and after many altercations they absolutely resisted the sergeant upon which a fray ensued within the comptergates between feras and the officers not without mutual hurt so that the sergeant was driven to defend himself with his mace of arms and had the crown of it broken with warding off a stroke the sheriffs of london so far from appeasing fomented the quarrel and with insolent language refused to deliver their prisoner upon which the sergeant thus abused returned to the house and related what had happened this circumstance so exasperated the burgesses that they all rose and went into the upper house and declared they would transact no more business till their member was restored to them they then commanded their sergeant again to go to the compter with his mace and make a second demand by their authority  the sheriffs hearing that the upper house had concerned themselves in it and being afraid of their resentment restored the prisoner before the sergeant had time to return to the compter but this did not satisfy the burgesses they summoned the sheriffs before them together with one white who in contempt of their dignity had taken out a writ against ferrars and as a punishment for their insolence they were sent to the tower and ever since that period the power and privilege of the commons have been on the increase  ferrars continued in high favor with henry during the remainder of his reign and seems to have stood upon good terms with somerset lord protector in the beginning of edward vi since it appears that he attended the protector in quality of one of the commissioners of the army in his expedition into scotland in      pattens journal of the scotch expedition p    which perhaps might be owing to his being about the person of prince edward in his fathers lifetime another instance of this happened about four years afterward at a very critical juncture for when the unfortunate duke of somerset lay under sentence of death and it was observed that the people murmured and often gave testimonies of discontent and that the king himself was very uneasy those about him studied every method to quiet and amuse the one to entertain and divert the other stows annal p  0   in order to this at the entrance of christmas holidays mr ferrars was proclaimed lord misrule that is a kind of prince of sports and pastimes which office he discharged for twelve days together at greenwich with great magnificence and address and entirely to the kings satisfaction  in this character attended by the politest part of the court he made an excursion to london where he was splendidly entertained by the lord mayor and when he took his leave he had presents given him him in token of respect but notwithstanding he made so great figure in the diversions at court yet he was no idle spectator of political affairs and maintained his reputation with the learned world he wrote the reign of queen mary which though published in the name of richard grafton in his chronicles yet was certainly the performance of ferrars according to the annals of stow p     whose authority in this case is very high our author was an historian a lawyer and a politician even in his poetry as appears from these pieces of his which are inserted in the mirror of magistrates and which are not inferior to any others that have found a place there land  0  in the early part of his life he wrote some tracts on his own profession which gained him great reputation and which discover that he was a lover of liberty and not disposed to sacrifice to the crown the rights and properties of the subject it seldom happens that when a man often changes his situation or is forced to do so that he continues to preserve the good opinion of different parties but this was a happiness which ferrars enjoyed he was consulted by the learned as a candid critic admired and loved by all who conversed with him  with respect to the time of our authors death we cannot be absolutely certain all we know is that he died in the year      at his house in flamstead in hertfordshire and was buried in the parish church for as wood informs us on the eighteenth of may the same year a commission was granted from the prerogative to administer the goods debts chattles etc of george ferrars lately deceased athen oxon vol   col      none of our authors deliver any thing as to mr ferrarss religion but it is highly probable that he was a zealous protestant not from his accepting grants of abbeylands for that is but a precarious proof but from his coming into the world under the protection of thomas lord cromwell who was certainly persuaded of the truth of the protestant religion  having this occasion to mention thomas lord cromwell the famous earl of essex who was our authors warmest patron i am persuaded my readers will forgive me a digression which will open to them the noblest instance of gratitude and honor in that worthy nobleman that ever adorned the page of an historian and which has been told with rapture by all who have writ of the times particularly by dr burnet in his history of the reformation and fox in his martyrology  thomas lord cromwell was the son of a blacksmith at putney and was a soldier under the duke of bourbon at the sacking of rome in the year      while he was abroad in a military character in a very low station he fell sick and was unable to follow the army he was observed one day by an italian merchant to walk very pensive and had all the appearance of penury and wretchedness the merchant enquired of him the place of his birth and fortune and upon conversing with cromwell was so well pleased with the account he gave of himself that he supplied him with money and credit to carry him to england cromwell afterward made the most rapid progress in statepreferments ever known honors were multiplied thick upon him and he came to have the dispensing of his sovereigns bounty it happened that this italian merchants circumstances decayed and he came to england to solicit the payment of some debts due to him by his correspondents who finding him necessitous were disposed to put him off and take the advantage of his want to avoid payment this not a little embarrassed the foreigner who was now in a situation forlorn enough as providence would have it lord cromwell then earl of essex rding to court saw this merchant walking with a dejected countenance which put him in mind of his former situation he immediately ordered one of his attendants to desire the merchant to come to his house his lordship asked the merchant whether he knew him he answered no cromwell then related the circumstance of the merchants relieving a certain englishman and asked if he remembered it the merchant answered that he had always made it his business to do good but did not remember that circumstance  his lordship then enquired the reason of his coming to england and upon the merchants telling him his story he so interested himself as soon to procure the payment of all his debts  cromwell then informed the merchant that he was himself the person he had thus relieved and for every ducat which the merchant had given him he returned to the value of a hundred telling him that this was the payment of his debt he then made him a munificent present and asked him whether he chose to settle in england or return to his own country the foreigner chose the latter and returned to spend the remainder of his days in competence and quiet after having experienced in lord essex as high an instance of generosity and gratitude as perhaps ever was known this nbe act of his lordship employed says burnet the pens of the best writers at that time in panegyris on so great a behavior the finest poets praised him his most violent enemies could not help admiring him and latest posterity shall hold the name of him in veneration who was capable of so generous an act of honor but to return to ferrars  in our authors history of the reign of queen mary though he shows himself a great admirer of the personal virtues of that princess and a very discerning and able historian yet it is every where evident that he was attached to the protestant interest but more especially in the learned account he gives of archbishop cranmers death and sir thomas wyats insurrection graftons chron p    0       the works of this author which are printed in the mirror of magistrates are as follow the fall of robert tresilian chief justice of england for misconstruing the laws and expounding them to serve the princes affections the tragedy or unlawful murder of thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester the tragedy of richard ii the story of dame eleanor cobham duchess of gloucester the story of humphry plantagenet duke of gloucester protector of england the tragedy of edmund duke of somerset   among these the complaints of eleanor cobham duchess of gloucester who was banished for consulting conjurers and fortune tellers about the life of king henry vi and whose exile quickly made way for the murder of her husband has of all his compositions been most admired and from this i shall quote a few lines which that lady speaks the isle of man was the appointed place to penance me for ever in exile thither in haste they posted me apace and doubting scape they pined me in a pyle close by myself in care alas the while there felt i first poor prisoners hungry fare much want things skant and stone walls hard and bare the change was strange from silk and cloth of gold to rugged fryze my carcass for to cloth from princes fare and dainties hot and cold to rotten fish and meats that one would loath the diet and dressing were much alike boath bedding and lodging were all alike fine such down it was as served well for swyne   sir philip sidney this great ornament to human nature to literature and to britain was the son of sir henry s dney knight of the garter and three times lord deputy of ireland and of lady mary dudley daughter to the duke of northumberland and nephew to that great favorite robert earl of leicester  oxford had the honor of his education under the tuition of dr thomas thornton canon of christ church at the university he remained till he was    years of age and in june      set out on his travels on the   th of august following when the massacre fell out at paris he was then there athen oxon solio p     and with other englishmen took shelter in sir francis walsinghams house her majestys ambassador at that court when this storm subsided he departed from paris went through lorrain and by strasburgh and heydelburgh to francfort in september or october following where he settled for some time and was entertained agent for the duke of saxony at his return her majesty was one of the first who distinguished his great abilities and as proud of so rich a treasure she sent him ambassador to rodolph the emperor to condole him on the death of maximilian and also to other princes of germany the next year      he went to the court of that gallant prince don john de austria viceroy in the low countries for the king of spain don john was the proudest man in his time haughty and imperious in his behavior and always used the foreign ambassadors who came to his court with unsufferable insolence and superiority at first he paid but little respect to sidney on account of his youth and seeming inexperience but having had occasion to hear him talk and give some account of the manners of every court where he had been he was so struck with his vivacity the propriety of his observations and the luster of his parts that he ever afterward used him with familiarity and paid him more respect in his private character than he did to any ambassador srom whatever court some years after this wood observes that in a book called cabala he set forth his reasons why the marriage of the queen with the duke of anjou was disadvantageous to the nation this address was written at the desire of the earl of leicester his uncle upon which a quarrel happened between him and the earl of oxford which perhaps occasioned his retirement from court for two years when he wrote that renowned romance called arcadia we find him again in high favor when the treaty of marriage was renewed he was engaged with sir fulk greville in tilting for the diversion of the court and at the departure of the duke of anjou from england he attended him to antwerp wood p       on the  th of january      he received the honor of knighthood from the queen and in the beginning of the year      he designed an expeditin with sir francis drake into america but being hindered by the queen who thought the court would be deficient without him he was made governor of flushing about that time delivered to the queen for one of the cautionary towns and general of the horse in both these places of important trust his behavior in point of prudence and valor was irreproachable and gained additional honor to his country especially when in july      he surprised axil and preserved the lives and reputation of the english army at the enterprise of gravelin about that time he was in election for the crown of poland but the queen refused to promote this his glorious advancement not from jealousy but from the fear  of her times he united the statesman the scholar and the soldier and as by the one he purchased same and honor in his life so by the other he has acquired immortality after death  in the year      when that unfortunate stand was made against the spaniards before zutphen the   d of september when he was getting upon the third horse having had two slain under him besore he was wounded with a musket shot out of the trenches which broke the bone of his thigh the horse he rode upon was rather furiously choleric than bravely proud so forced him to forsake the field but not his back as the noblest and fittest bier says lord brook to carry a martial commander to his grave in this progress passing along by the rest of the army where his uncle the earl of leicester general was and being faint with excess of bleeding he called for drink which was presently brought him but as he was putting the bottle to his mouth he saw a poor soldier carried along who had been wounded at the same time wishfully cast up his eyes at the bottle whereupon sir philip took it from his own mouth before he drank and delivered it to the poor man with these words thy necessity is yet greater than mine and when he had assisted this poor soldier and sellow sufferer as he called him he was presently carried to arnheim where the principal surgeons of the camp attended him  this generous behavior of our gallant knight ought not to pass without a panegyric all his deeds os bravery his politeness his learning and courtly accomplishments do not reflect so much honor upon him as this one disinterested truly heroic action it discovered so tender and benevolent a nature a mind so fortified against pain a heart so overflowing with generous sentiments to relieve in opposition to the violent call of his own necessities a poor man languishing in the same distress before himself that as none can read it without the highest admiration of the wounded hero so none i hope will think me extravagant in thus endeavoring to extol it bravery is often constitutional fame may be the motive to feats of arms a statesman and a courtier may act from interest but a sacrifice so generous as this can be made by none but those who are good as well as great who are nobleminded and gloriously compassionate like sidney  when the surgeons began to dress his wound he told them that while his strength was yet entire his body free from a fever and his mind able to endure they might freely use their art cut and search to the bottom but if they should neglect their art and renew torments in the declination of nature their ignorance or overtendernes would prove a kind of tyranny to their friend and reflect no honor upon themselves  for sometime they had great hopes of his recovery and so zealous were they to promote it and overjoyed at its seeming approach that they spread the report of it which soon reached london and disfased the most general joy at court that ever was known  at the same time count hollock was under the care of a most excellent surgeon for a wound in his threat by a musket shot yet he neglected his own extremity to save his friend and for that purpose sent him to sir philip this surgeon notwithstanding ou of love to his master returning one day to dress his wound the count cheerfully aked him how sir philip did he answered with a dejected look that he was not well at these words the count as having more sense of his friends wound than his own cried out away villain never see my face again till you bring better news of that gentlemans recovery for whose redemption many such as i were happily lost  finding all the efforts of the surgeons in vain he began to put no more confidence in their skill and resigned himself with heroic patience to his fate he called the ministers to him who were all excellent men of different nations and before them made such a confession of christian faith as no book but the heart can truly and feelingly deliver then calling for his will and settling his temporal affairs the last scene of this tragedy was the parting between the two brothers sir philip exerted all his soul in endeavoring to suppress his sorrow in which affection and nature were too powerful for him while the other demonstrated his tenderness by immoderate transports of grief a weakness which every tender breast will easily forgive who have ever felt the pangs of parting from a brother and a brother of sir philip sidneys worth demanded still additional sorrow he took his leave with these admonishing words my dear much loved honored brother love my memory cherish my friends their faith to me may assure you they are honest but above all govern your will and affections by the will and word of your creator in me beholding the end of this world with all her vanities and with this farewell he desired the company to lead him away  after his death which happened on the   th of october the states of zealand became suitors to his majesty and his noble friends that they might have the honor of burying his body at the public expense of their government lord brooks life but in this they were denied for soon after his body was brought to flushing and being embarked with great solemnity on the  st of november landed at tower wharf on the  th of the same month and the   th of february following after having lain in state it was magnificently deposited in st pauls cathedral  as the funeral of many princes has not exceeded it in solemnity so few have equalled it in the undissembled sorrow for his loss for a great many months after his death it was reckoned indecent in any gentleman to appear splendidly dressed the public mouned him not with exterior formality but with the genuine sorrow of the heart of all our poets he seems to be the most courtly the bravest the most active and in the moral sense the best  king james writ an epitaph upon him and the muses of oxford lamenting him composed elegies to his memory it may be justly said of this great man what a celebrated poet now living has applied to archbishop laud around his tomb did art and genius weep beauty wit piety and bravery were undissembled mourners   he left behind him one child named elizabeth married to the earl of rutland whom he had by sir francis walsinghams daughter and who unfortunately died without issue to perpetuate the living virtues of her illustrious family she is said to have been excessively beautiful that she married the earl of rutland by authority but that her affections were dedicated to the earl of essex and as queen elizabeth was in love with that nobleman she became very jealous of this charming countess it has been commonly reported camden brit in kent that sir philip some hours before his death enjoined a near friend to consign his works to the flames what promise his friend returned is uncertain but if he broke his word to befriend the public posterity has thanked him and every future age will with gratitude acknowledge the favor  of all his works his arcadia is the most celebrated it is dedicated to his sister the countess of pembroke who was a lady of as fine a character and as equally finished in every female accomplishment as her brother in the manly she lived to a good old age and died in      ben johnson has wrote an epitaph upon her so inimitably excellent that i cannot resist the temptation of inserting it here she was buried in the cathedral church of salisbury among the graves of the family of the pembrokes epitaph underneath this marble hearse lies the subject of all verse sidneys sister pembrokes mother death ere thou have killed another learned and fair and good as she time shall throw his dart at thee   the arcadia was printed first in      in  to it has been translated into almost every language as the ancient egyptians presented secrets under their mystical hyeroglyphics so that an easy figure was exhibited to the eye and a higher notion couched under it to the judgment so all the arcadia is a continual grove of morality shadowing moral and political truths under the plain and striking emblems of lovers so that the reader may be deceived but not hurt and happily surprised to more knowledge than he expected  besides the celebrated arcadia sir philip wrote a dissuasive letter addressed to queen elizabeth against her marriage with the duke of anjou printed in a book called serinia ceciliana  to      astrophel and stella written at the desire of lady rich whom he perfectly loved and is thought to be celebrated in the arcadia by the name of philoclea  ourania a poem   0  an essay on valor some impute this to sir thomas overbury almanzor and almanzaida a novel printed in      which is likewise disputed and

each other to abuse chistopher marloe was bred a student in cambridge but there is no account extant of his family he soon quitted the university and became a player on the same stage with the incomparable shakespeare he was accounted says langbaine a very fine poet in his time even by ben johnson himself and heywood his fellowactor styles him the best of poets in a copy of verses called the censure of the poets he was thus characterized next marloe bathed in thespian springs had in him those brave sublunary things that your first poets had his raptures were all air and fire which made his verses clear for that fine madness still he did retain which rightly should possess a poets brain   his genius inclined him wholly to tragedy and he obliged the world with six plays besides one he joined for with nash called dido queen of carthage but before i give an account of them i shall present his character to the reader upon the authority of anthony wood which is too singular to be passed over this marloe we are told presuming upon his own little wit thought proper to practice the most epicurean indulgence and openly professed atheism he denied god our savior he blasphemed the adorable trinity and as it was reported wrote several discourses against it affirming our savior to be a deceiver the sacred scriptures to contain nothing but idle stories and all religion to be a device of policy and priestcraft but marloe came to a very untimely end as some remarked in consequence of his execrable blasphemies it happened that he fell deeply in love with a low girl and had for his rival a fellow in livery who looked more like a pimp than a lover marloe fired with jealousy and having some reason to believe that his mistress granted the fellow favors he rushed upon him to stab him with his dagger but the footman being quick avoided the stroke and catching hold of marloes wrist stabbed him with his own weapon and notwithstanding all the assistance of surgery he soon after died of the wound in the year      some time before his death he had begun and made a considerable progress in an excellent poem called hero and leander which was afterward finished by george chapman who fell short as it is said of the spirit and invention of marloe in the execution of it  what credit may be due to mr woods severe representation of this poets character the reader must judge for himself for my part i am willing to suspend my judgment till i meet with some other testimony of his having thus heinously offended against his god and against the best and most amiable system of religion that ever was or ever can be marloe might possibly be inclined to freethinking without running the unhappy legths that mr wood tells us it was reported he had done we have many instances of characters being too lightly taken up on report and mistakenly represented through a too easy credulity especially against a man who may happen to differ from us in some speculative points wherein each party however may think himself orthodox the good dr clarke himself has been as ill spoken of as wood speaks of marloe  his other works are   dr faustus his tragical history

occasion of the massacre and ends with the death of henry iii of france   tamerlain the great or the scythian shepherd a tragedy in two parts printed in an old black letter  vo      this is said to be the worst of his productions   robert green received his education at the university of cambridge and was as winstanley says a great friend to the printers by the many books he writ he was a merry droll in those times and a man so addicted to pleasure that as winstanley observes he drank much deeper draughts of sack than of the heliconian stream he was amongst the first of our poets who writ for bread and in order the better to support himself though he lived in an age far from being dissolute viz in that of the renowned queen elizabeth yet he had recourse to the mean expedient of writing obscenity and favoring the cause of vice by which he no doubt recommended himself to the rakes about town who as they are generally no true judges of wit so estimate the merit of a piece as it happens to suit their appetite or encourage them in every irregular indulgence no man of honor who sees a poet endowed with a large share of natural understanding prostituting his pen to the vilest purpose of debauchery and lewdness can think of him but with contempt and his wit however brilliant ought not to screen him from the just indignation of the sober part of mankind when wit is prostituted to vice it is wit no more that is it ceases to be true wit and i have often thought there should be some public mark of infamy fixed on those who hurt society by loose writings but mr green must be freed from the imputation of hypocrisy for we find him practicing the very doctrines he taught winstanley relates that he was married to a very fine and deserving lady whom he basely forsook with a child she had by him for the company of some harlots to whom he applied the wages of iniquity while his wife starved after some years indulgence of this sort when his wit began to grow stale we find him fallen into abject poverty and lamenting the life he had led which brought him to it for it always happens that a mistress is a more expensive piece of furniniture than a wife and if the modern adulterers would speak the truth i am certain they would acknowledge that half the money which in the true sense of the word is misspent upon those daughters of destruction would keep a family with decency and maintain a wife with honor when our author was in this forlorn miserable state he writ a letter to his wife which mr winstanly has preserved and which as it has somewhat tender in it i shall insert it has often been observed that half the unhappy marriages in the world are more owing to the men than the women that women are in general much better beings in the moral sense than the men who as they bustle less in life are generally unacquainted with those artifices and tricks which are acquired by a knowledge of the world and that then their yokefellows need only be tender and indulgent to win them but i believe it may be generally allowed that women are the best or worst part of the human creation none excel them in virtue but when they depart from it none exceed them in vice in the case of green we shall see by the letter he sent his wife how much she was injured  the remembrance of many wrongs offered thee and thy unreproved virtues add greater sorrow to my miserable state than i can utter or thou conceive neither is it lessened by consideration of thy absence though shame would let me hardly behold thy face but exceedingly aggravated for that i cannot as i ought to thy ownself reconcile myself that thou might witness my inward woe at this instant that has made thee a woeful wife for so long a time but equal heaven has denied that comfort giving at my last need like succor as i have sought all my life being in this extremity as void of help as thou have been of hope reason would that after so long waste i should not send thee a child to bring thee charge but consider he is the fruit of thy womb in whose face regard not the father so much as thy own perfections he is yet green and may grow strait if he be carefully tended otherwise apt enough to follow his fathers folly that i have offended thee highly i know that thou can forget my injuries i hardly believe yet i persuade myself that if thou saw my wretched estate thou could not but lament it nay certainly i know thou would all thy wrongs muster themselves about me and every evil at once plagues me for my contempt of god i am contemned of men for my swearing and forswearing no man will believe me for my gluttony i suffer hunger for my drunkenness thirst for my adultery ulcerous sores thus god has cast me down that i might be humbled and punished for example of others and though he suffers me in this world to perish without succor yet i trust in the world to come to find mercy by the merits of my savior to whom i commend thee and commit my soul  thy repentant husband for his disloyalty robert green   this authors works are chiefly these  the honorable history of friar bacon and friar bungy played by the prince of palatines servants i know not whence our author borrowed his plot but this famous friar minor lived in the reign of henry iii and died in the reign of edward i in the year      he joined with dr lodge in one play called a looking glass for london he writ also the comedies of friar bacon and fair enome his other pieces are quip for an upstart courtier and dorastus and fawnia winstanley imputes likewise to him the following pieces tullys loves philomela the lady fitzwaters nightingale greens news too late first and second part greens arcadia greens farewell to folly greens groatsworth of wit  it is said by wood in his fasti p     vol i that our author died in the year      of a surfeit taken by eating pickled herrings and drinking with them rhenish wine at this fatal banquet thomas nash his cotemporary at cambridge was with him who rallies him in his apology of pierce pennyless thus died robert green whose end may be looked upon as a kind of punishment for a life spent in riot and infamy  edmund spenser was born in london and educated at pembroke hall in cambridge the accounts of the birth and family of this great man are but obscure and impersect and at his first setting out into life his fortune and interest seem to have been very inconsiderable  after he had for some time continued at the college and laid that foundation of learning which joined to his natural genius qualified him to rise to so great an excellency he stood for a fellowship in competition with mr andrews a gentleman in holy orders and afterward lord bishop of winchester in which he was unsuccessful this disappointment joined with the narrowness of his circumstances forced him to quit the university hughess life of spenser prefixed to the edition of our authors works  and we find him next residing at the house of a friend in the north where he fell in love with his rosalind whom he finely celebrates in his pastoral poems and of whose cruelty he has written such pathetical complaints  it is probable that about this time spensers genius began first to distinguish itself for the shepherds calendar which is so full of his unprosperous passion for rosalind was amongst the first of his works of note and the supposition is strengthened by the consideration of poetrys being frequently the offspring of love and retirement this work he addressed by a short dedication to the maecenas of his age the immortal sir philip sidney this gentleman was now in the highest reputation both for wit and gallantry and the most popular of all the courtiers of his age and as he was himself a writer and especially excelled in the fabulous or inventive part of poetry it is no wonder he was struck with our authors genius and became sensible of his merit a story is told of him by mr hughes which i shall present the reader as it serves to illustrate the great worth and penetration of sidney as well as the excellent genius of spenser it is said that our poet was a stranger to this gentleman when he began to write his pairy queen and that he took occasion to go to leicesterhouse and introduce himself by sending in to mr sidney a copy of the ninth canto of the first book of that poem sidney was much surprised with the description of despair in that canto and is said to have shown an unusual kind of transport on the discovery of so new and uncommon a genius after he had read some stanzas he turned to his steward and bid him give the person that brought those verses fifty pounds but upon reading the next stanza he ordered the sum to be doubled the steward was no less surprised than his master and thought it his duty to make some delay in executing so sudden and lavish a bounty but upon reading one stanza more mr sidney raised the gratuity to two hundred pounds and commanded the steward to give it immediately lest as he read further he might be tempted to give away his whole estate from this time he admitted the author to his acquaintance and conversation and prepared the way for his being known and received at court  though this seemed a promising omen to be thus introduced to court yet he did not instantly reap any advantage from it he was indeed created poet laureat to queen elizabeth but he for some time wore a barren laurel and possessed only the place without the pension hughes ubi supra  lord treasurer burleigh under whose displeasure spenser labored took care to intercept the queens favors to this unhappy great man as misfortunes have the most influence on elegant and polished minds so it was no wonder that spenser was much depressed by the cold reception he met with from the great a circumstance which not a little detracts from the merit of the ministers then in power for i know not if all the political transactions of burleigh are sufficient to counterballance the infamy affixed on his name by prosecuting resentment against distressed merit and keeping him who was the ornament of the times as much distant as possible from the approach of competence these discouragements greatly sunk our authors spirit and accordingly we find him pouring out his heart in complaints of so injurious and undeserved a treatment which probably would have been less unfortunate to him if his noble patron sir philip sidney had not been so much absent from court as by his employments abroad and the share he had in the low country wars he was obliged to be in a poem called the ruins of time which was written some time after sidneys death the author seems to allude to the discouragement i have mentioned in the following stanza o grief of griefs o gall of all good hearts to see that virtue should despised be of such as first were raised for virtues parts and now broadspreading like an aged tree let none shoot up that nigh them planted be o let not these of whom the muse is scorned alive or dead be by the muse adorned   these lines are certainly meant to reflect on burleigh for neglecting him and the lord treasurer afterward conceived a hatred toward him for the satire he apprehended was levelled at him in mother hubbards tale in this poem the author has in the most lively manner painted out the misfortune of depending on court favors the lines which follow are among others very remarkable full little know thou that have not tried what hell it is in suing long to bide to close good days that nights be better spent to waste long nights in pensive discontent to speed to day to be put back tomorrow to feed on hope to pine with fear and sorrow to have thy princes grace yet want her peers to have thy asking yet wait many years to fret thy soul with crosses and with care to eat thy heart through comfortless despair to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run to spend to give to want to be undone   as this was very much the authors case it probably was the particular passage in that poem which gave offense for as hughes very elegantly observes even the sighs of a miserable man are sometimes resented as an affront by him who is the occasion of them there is a little story which seems founded on the grievance just now mentioned and is related by some as a matter of fact winst p    commonly reported at that time it is said that upon his presenting some poems to the queen she ordered him a gratuity of one hundred pounds but the lord treasurer burleigh objecting to it said with some scorn of the poet of whose merit he was totally ignorant what all this for a song the queen replied then give him what is reason spenser for some time waited but had the mortification to find himself disappointed of her majestys bounty upon this he took a proper opportunity to present a paper to queen elizabeth in the manner of a petition in which he reminded her of the order she had given in the following lines i was promised on a time to have reason for my rhyme from that time unto this season i received nor rhyme nor reason   this paper produced the intended effect and the queen after sharply reproving the treasurer immediately directed the payment of the hundred pounds she had first ordered in the year      he was sent abroad by the earl of leicester as appears by a copy of latin verses dated from leicesterhouse and addressed to his friend mr harvey but mr hughes has not been able to determine in what service we was employed when the lord gray of wilton was chosen deputy of ireland spenser was recommended to him as secretary this drew him over to another kingdom and settled him in a scene of life very different from what he had formerly known but that he understood and discharged his employment with skill and capacity appears sufficiently by his discourse on the state of ireland in which there are many solid and judicious remarks that show him no less qualified for the business of the state than for the entertainment of the muses his life was now freed from the difficulties under which it had hitherto struggled and his services to the crown received a reward of a grant from queen elizabeth of  000 acres of land in the county of cork his house was in kilcolman and the river mulla which he has more than once so finely introduced in his poems ran through his grounds much about this time he contracted an intimate friendship with the great and learned sir walter raleigh who was then a captain under the lord gray the poem of spensers called colin clouts come home again in which sir walter raleigh is described under the name of the shepherd of the ocean is a beautiful memorial of this friendship which took its rise from a similarity of taste in the polite arts and which he agreeably describes with a softness and delicacy peculiar to him sir walter afterward promoted him in queen elizabeths esteem through whose recommendation she read his writings he now fell in love a second time with a merchants daughter in which says mrs cooper author of the muses library he was more successful than in his first amor he wrote upon this occasion a beautiful epithalamium with which he presented the lady on the bridalday and has consigned that day and her to immortality in this pleasant easy situation our excellent poet finished the celebrated poem of the fairy queen which was begun and continued at different intervals of time and of which he at first published only the three first books to these were added three more in a following edition but the six last books excepting the two cantos of mutability were unfortunately lost by his servant whom he had in haste sent before him into england for though he passed his life for some time very serenely here yet a train of misfortunes still pursued him and in the rebellion of the earl of desmond he was plundered and deprived of his estate this distress forced him to return to england where for want of his noble patron sir philip sidney he was plunged into new calamities as that gallant hero died of the wounds he received at zutphen it is said by mr hughes that spenser survived his patron about twelve years and died the same year with his powerfl enemy the lord burleigh      he was buried says he in westminsterabbey near the famous geoffery chauer as he had desired his obsequies were attended by the poets of that time and others who paid the last honors to his memory several copies of verses were thrown after him into his grave and his monument was erected at the charge of the famous robert devereux the unfortunate earl of essex this is the account given by his editor of the death of spenser but there is some reason to believe that he spoke only upon imagination as he has produced no authority to support his opinion especially as i find in a book of great reputation another opinion delivered upon probable grounds the ingenious mr drummond of hawthronden a noble wit of scotland had an intimate correspondence with all the geniuss of his time who resided at london particularly the famous ben johnson who had so high an opinion of mr drummonds abilities that he took a journey into scotland in order to converse with him and stayed some time at his house at hawthronden after ben johnson departed mr drummond careful to retain what past betwixt them wrote down the heads of their conversation which is published amongst his poems and history of the five jamess kings of scotland amongst other particulars there is this ben johnson told me that spensers goods were robbed by the irish in desmonds rebellion his house and a little child of his burnt and he and his wife nearly escaped that he afterward died in king street dublin by absolute want of bread and that he refused twenty pieces sent him by the earl of essex the general of the english army in ireland  and gave this answer to the person who brought them that he was sure he had no time to spend them  mr drummonds works from whence i have extacted the above are printed in a thin quarto and may be seen at mr wilsons at platoshead in the strand i have been thus particular in the quotation that no one may suspect such extraordinary circumstances to be advanced upon imagination in the inscription on his tomb in westminster abbey it is said he was born in the year    0 and died      cambden says      but in regard to his birth they must both be mistaken for it is by no means probable he was born so early as    0 if we judge by the remarkable circumstance of his standing for a fellowship in competition with mr andrews who was not born according to hughes till      besides if this account of his birth be true he must have been sixty years old when he first published his shepherds calendar an age not very proper for love and in this case it is no wonder that the beautiful rosalind slighted his addresses and he must have been seventy years old when he entered into business under lord gray who was created deputy in ireland    0 for which reasons we may fairly conclude that the inscription is false either by the error of the carver or perhaps it was put on when the monument was aired  there are very few particulars of this great poet and it must be a mortification to all lovers of the muses that no more can be found concerning the life of one who was the greatest ornament of his profession no writer ever found a nearer way to the heart than he and his verses have a peculiar happiness of recommending the author to our friendship as well as raising our admiration one cannot read him without fancying oneself transported into fairy land and there conversing with the graces in that enchanted region in elegance of thinking and fertility of imagination few of our english authors have approached him and no writers have such power as he to awake the spirit of poetry in others cowley owns that he derived inspiration from him and i have heard the celebrated mr james thomson the author of the seasons and justly esteemed one of our best descriptive poets say that he formed himself upon spenser and how closely he pursued the model and how nobly he has imitated him whoever reads his castle of indolence with taste will readily confess  mr addison in his characters of the english poets addressed to mr sacheverel thus speaks of spenser old spenser next warmed with poetic rage in ancient tales amused a barbarous age an age that yet uncultivate and rude wherever the poets fancy led pursued through pathless fields and unfrequented floods to dens of dragons and enchanted woods but now the mystic tale that pleased of yore can charm an understanding age no more the long spun allegories fulsome grow while the dull moral lies too plain below we view well pleased at distance all the sights of arms and palfries battles fields and fights and damsels in distress and courteous knights but when we look too near the shades decay and all the pleasing landscape fades away   it is agreed on all hands that the distresses of our author helped to shorten his days and indeed when his extraordinary merit is considered he had the hardest measure of any of our poets it appears from different accounts that he was of an amiable sweet disposition humane and generous in his nature besides the fairy queen we find he had written several other pieces of which we can only trace out the titles among these the most considerable were nine comedies in imitation of the comedies of his admired ariosto inscribed with the names of the nine muses the rest which are mentioned in his letters and those of his friends are his dying pelicane his pageants semmata dudleyana the canticles paraphrazed ecclesiastes seven psalms hours of our lord sacrifice of a sinner purgatory a sennight slumber the court of cupid and hell of lovers it is likewise said he had written a treatise in prose called the english poet as for the epithalamion thamesis and his dreams both mentioned by himself in one of his letters mr hughes thinks they are still preserved though under different names it appears from what is said of the dreams by his friend mr harvey that they were in imitation of petrarchs visions  to produce authorities in favor of spenser as a poet i should reckon an affront to his memory that is a tribute which i shall only pay to inferior wits whose highest honor it is to be mentioned with respect by geniuss of a superior class the works of spenser will never perish though he has introduced unnecessarily many obsolete terms into them there is a flow of poetry an elegance of sentiment a fund of imagination and an enchanting enthusiasm which will ever secure him the applauses of posterity while any lovers of poetry remain  we find little account of the family which spenser left behind him only that in a few particulars of his life prefixed to the last folio edition of his works it is said that his great grandson hugolin spenser after the restration of king charles ii wa restored by the court of claims to so much of the lands as uld be found to have been his ancestors there is another remarkable passage of which says hughes i can give the reader much better assurance that a person came over from ireland in king williams time to solicit the same affair and brought with him letters of recommendation as a descendant of spenser his name procured him a favorable reception and he applied himself particularly to mr congeve by whom he was generously recommended to the favor of the earl of hallifax who was then at the head of the treaury and by that means he obtained his suit this man was somewhat advanced in years and might be the same mentioned before who had possibly recovered only some part of his estate at first or had been disturbed in the possession of it he could give no account of the works of his ancestor which are wanting and which are therefore in all probability irrecoverably lost  the following stanzas are said to be those with which sir philip sidney was first struck from him returning sad and comfortless as on the way together we did fare we met that villain god from him me bless that cursed wight from whom i escaped whylear a man of hell that calls himself despair who first us greets and after fair areeds of tidings strange and of adventures rare so creeping close as snake in hidden weeds inquireth of our states and of our knightly deeds which when he knew and felt our feeble hearts embossed with bale and bitterbiting grief which love had launced with his deadly darts with wounding words and terms of foul reprief he plucked from us all hope of due relief that est us held in love of lingering lite then hopeless heartless gan the cunning thief persuade us die to stin all further strife to me he lent this rope to him a rusty knife   the following is the picture the darksome cave they enter where they find that cursed man low sitting on the ground musing full sadly in his sullen mind his greasy locks long growing and unbound disordered hung about his shoulders round and hid his face through which his hollow eyne looked deadly dull and stared as astound his rawbone cheeks through penury and pine were shrunk into his jaws as he did never dine his garments naught but many ragged clouts with thorns together pinned and patched was the which his naked sides he wrapped abouts and him beside there lay upon the grass a dreary corse whose life away did pass all wallowed in his own yet lukewarm blood that from his wound yet welled fresh alas in which a rusty knife fast fixed stood and made an open passage for the gushing flood   it would perhaps be an injury to spenser to dismiss his life without a few remarks on that great work of his which has placed him among the foremost of our poets and discovered so eleated and sublime a genius the work i mean is his allegorical poem of the fairy queen  sir william temple in his essay on poetry says that the religion of the gentiles had been woven into the contexture of all the ancient poetry with an agreeable mixture which made the moderns affect to give that of christianity a place also in their poems but the true religion was not found to become fictitious so well as the false one had done and all their attempts of this kind seemed rather to debase religion than heighten poetry spenser endeavored to supply this with morality and to make instruction instead of story the subject of an epic poem his execution was excellent and his flights of fancy very noble and high but his design was poor and his moral lay so bare that it lost the effect it is true the pill was gilded but so thin that the color and the taste were easily discovered  mr rymer asserts that spenser may be reckoned the first of our heroic poets he had a large spirit a sharp judgment and a genius for heroic poetry perhaps above any that ever wrote since virgil but our misfortune is he wanted a true idea and lost himself by following an unfaithful guide though besides hmer and virgil he had read tasso yet he rather suffered himself to be misled by ariosto with whom blindly rambling on marvels and adventures he makes no conscience of probability all is fanciful and chimerical without any uniformity or without any foundation in truth in a word his poem is perfect fairyland thus far sir william temple and mr rymer let us now attend to the opinion of a greater name mr dryden in his dedication of juvenal thus proceeds the english have only to boast of spenser and milton in heroic poetry who neither of them wanted either genius or learning to have been perfect poets and yet both of them are liable to many censures for there is no uniformity in the design of spenser he aims at the accomplishment of no one action he raises up a hero for every one of his adventures and endows each of them with some particular moral virtue which renders them all equal without subordination or preference every one is valiant in his own legend only we must do him the justice to observe that magnanimity which is the character of prince arthur shines throughout the whole poem and succors the rest when they are in distress the original of every knight was then living in the court of queen elizabeth and he attributed to each of them that virtue which he thought was most conspicuous in them an ingenious piece of flattery though it turned not much to his account had he lived o finish his poem in the remaining  it had certainly been more of a piece but could not have been perfect because the model was not true but prince arthur or his chief patron sir philip sidney dying before him deprived the poet both of means and spirit to accomplish his design for the rest his obsolete language and ill choice of his stanza are faults both of the second magnitude for notwithstanding the first he is still intelligible at least after a little practice and for the last he is more to be admired that laboring under such disadvantages his verses are so numerous so various and so harmonious that only virgil whom he has professedly imitated has surpassed him among the romans and only waller among the english mr hughes in his essay on allegorical poetry prefixed to spensers works tells us that this poem is conceived wrought up and colored with stronger fancy and discovers more the particular genius of spenser than any of his other writings and having observed that spenser in a letter to sir walter raleigh calls it a continued allegory or dark conceit he gives us some remarks on allegorical poetry in general defining allegory to be a fable or story in which under imaginary persons or things is shadowed some real action or instructive moral or as i think says he it is somewhere very shortly defined by plutarch it is that in which one thing is related and another thing understood it is a kind of poetical picture or hieroglyphick which by its apt resemblance conveys instruction to the mind by an analogy to the senses and so amuses the fancy while it informs the understanding every allegory has therefore two senses the literal and mystical the literal sense is like a dream or vision of which the mystical sense is the true meaning or interpretation this will be more clearly apprehended by considering that as a simile is a more extended metaphor so an allegory is a kind of continued simile or an assemblage of similitudes drawn out at full length  the chief merit of this poem no doubt consists in that surprising vein of fabulous invention which runs through it and enriches it every where with imagery and descriptions more than we meet with in any other modern poem the author seems to be possessed of a kind of poetical magic and the figures he calls up to our view rise so thick upon us that we are at once pleased and distracted with the exhaustless variety of them so that his faults may in a manner be imputed to his excellencies his abundance betrays him into excess and his judgment is overborn by the torrent of his imagination that which seems the most liable to exception in this work is the model of it and the choice the author has made of so romantic a story the several books rather appear like so many several poems than one entire fable each of them has its peculiar knight and is independent of the rest and though some of the persons make their appearance in different books yet this has very little effect in concealing them prince arthur is indeed the principal person and has therefore a share given him in every legend but his part is not considerable enough in any one of them he appears and vanishes again like a spirit and we lose sight of him too soon to consider him as the hero of the poem these are the most obvious defects in the fable of the fairy queen the want of unity in the story makes it difficult for the reader to carry it in his mind and distracts too much his attention to the several parts of it and indeed the whole frame of it would appear monstrous were it to be examined by the rules of epic poetry as they have been drawn from the practice of homer and virgil but as it is plain the author never designed it by these rules i think it ought rather to be called a poem of a particular kind describing in a series of allegorical adventures or episodes the most noted virtues and vices to compare it therefore with the models of antiquity would be like drawing a parallel between the roman and gothic architecture in the first there is doubtless a more natural grandeur and simplicity in the latter we find great mixtures of beauty and barbarism yet assisted by the invention of a variety of inferior ornaments and though the former is more majestic in the whole the latter may be very surprising and agreeable in its parts  jasper heywood the son of the celebrated epigramatist was born in london and in the   th year of his ge      was sent to the university where he was educated in grammar and logic in      he took a degree in arts and was immediately elected probationer fellow of merton college where he gained a superiority over all his fellow students in disputations at the public school wood informs us that upon a third admonition from the warden and society of that house he resigned his fellowship to prevent expulsion on the  th of april      he had been guilty of several misdemeanors such as are peculiar to youth wildness and rakishness which in those days it seems were very severely punished soon after this he quitted england and entered himself into the society of jesus at st omers langb lives of the poets p      but before he left his native country he writ and translated says wood these things following various poems and devices some of which are printed in a book called the paradise of dainty devices       to hercules furens a tragedy which some have imputed to seneca and others have denied to be his but it is thought by most learned men to be an imitation of that play of euripides which bears the same name and tho in contrivance and economy they differ in some things yet in others they agree and scaliger scruples not to prefer the latin to the greek tragedy langb ubi supra  troas a tragedy of senecas which the learned farnaby and daniel heinsius very much commend the former stiling it a divine tragedy the other preferring it to one of the same name by euripides both in language and contrivance but especially he says it far exceeds it in the chorus in this tragedy the author has taken the liberty of adding several things and altering others as thinking the play impersect first as to the additions he has at the end of the chorus after the first act added threescore verses of his own invention in the beginning of the second act he has added a whole scene where he introduces the ghost of achilles rising from hell to require the sacrifice of polyxena to the chorus of this act he added three stanzas as to his alterations instead of translating the chorus of the third act which is wholly taken up with the names of foreign countries the translation of which without notes he thought would be tiresome to the english reader he has substituted in its stead another chorus of his own invention this tragedy runs in verses of fourteen syllables and for the most part his chorus is writ in verse of ten syllables which is called heroic thyestes another tragedy of senecas which in the judgment of hiensius is not inferior to any other of his dramatic pieces our author translated this play when he was at oxford it is wrote in the same manner of verse as the other only the chorus is written in alternate rhyme the translator has added a scene at the end of the fifth act spoken by thyestes alone in which he bewails his misery and implores heavens vengeance on atreus these plays are printed in a black letter in  to        langbain observes that though he cannot much commend the version of heywood as poetically elgant as he has chosen a measure of fourteen sylales which ever sounds harsh to the ears of those that are used to heroic poetry yet says he i must do the author this justice to acquaint the world tha he erdeavours to give senecas sense and likewise to imitate his verse changing his measure as often as his author the chorus of each act being different from the act itself as the reader may observe by comparing the english copy with the latin original  after our author had spent two years in the study of divinity amongst the priests he was sent to diling in switzerland where he continued about seventeen years in explaining and discussing controverted questions among those he called heretics in which time for his zeal for the holy mother he was promoted to the degree of dr of divinity and of the four vows at length pope gregory xiii calling him away in      he sent him with others the same year into the mission of england and the rather because the brethren there told his holiness that the harvest was great and the laborers few athen oxon  being settled then in the metropolis of his own country and esteemed the chief provincial of the jesuits in england it was taken notice of that he affected more the exterior show of a lord than the humility of a priest keeping as grand an equipage as money could then furnish him with dr fuller says that our author was executed in the reign of queen elizabeth but sir richard baker tells us that he was one of the chief of those  0 priests that were taken in the year      and when some of them were condemned and the rest in danger of the law her majesty caused them all to be shipped away and sent out of england upon heywoods being taken and committed to prison and the earl of warwick thereupon ready to relieve his necessity he made a copy of verses mentioned by sir john harrington concluding with these two  thanks to that lord that wills me good for i want all things saving hay and wood he afterward went to rome and at last settled in the city of naples where he became familiarly known to that zealous roman catholic john pitceus who speaks of him with great respect  it is unknown what he wrote or published after he became a jesuit it is said that he was a great critic in the hebrew language and that he digested an easy and short method reduced into tables for novices to learn that language which wood supposes was a compendium of a hebrew grammar our author paid the common debt of nature at naples      and was buried in the college of jesuits there  john lilly a writer who flourished in the reign of queen elizabeth he was a kentish man and in his younger years educated at st mary magdalen college in oxon where in the year      he took his degree of master of arts he was says langbaine a very close student and much addicted to poetry a proof of which he has given to the world in those plays which he has bequeathed to posterity and which in that age were well esteemed both by the court and by the university he was one of the first writers continues langbain who in those days attempted to reform the language and purge it from obsolete expressions mr blount a gentleman who has made himself known to the world by several peces of his own writing as horae subsecivae his microcosmography etc and who published six of these plays in his title page styles him the only rare poet of that time the witty comical facetiously quick and unparalleled john lilly mr blount further says that he sat at apollos table that apollo gave him a wreath of his own bays without snatching and that the lyre he played on had no borrowed strings he mentions a romance of our authors writing called euphues our nation says he are in his debt for a new english which he taught them euphues and his england began first that language and all our ladies were then his scholars and that beauty in court who could not read euphism was as little regarded as she who now speaks not french this extraordinary romance i acknowledge i have not read so cannot from myself give it a character but i have some reason to believe that it was a miserable performance from the authority of the author of the british theater who in his preface thus speaks of it this romance says he so fashionable for its wit so famous in the court of queen elizabeth and is said to have introduced so remarkable a change in our language i have seen and read it is an unnatural affected jargon in which the perpetual use of metaphors allusions allegories and analogies is to pass for wit and stiff bombast for language and with this nonsense the court of queen elizabeth whose times afforded better models for style and composition than almost any since became miserably infected and greatly helped to let in all the vile pedantry of language in the two following reigns so much mischief the most ridiculous instrument may do when he proposes to improve on the simplicity of nature

esquire of burton in gloucestershire one of the judges of the marches wood athen oxon  he was born with very bright parts and gave early discoveries of a rising genius in      the   th year of his age he became a gentleman commoner in queenscollege in oxford and in      as a squires son he took the degree of bachelor of arts he removed from thence to the middle temple in order to study the municipal law but did not long remain there winst ubi supra  his genius which was of a sprightly kind could not bear the consinement of a student or the drudgery of reading law he abandoned it therefore and traveled into france where he so improved himself in polite accomplishments that when he returned he was looked upon as one of the most finished gentlemen about court  soon after his arrival in england he contracted an intimacy which afterward grew into friendship with sir robert carre a scotch gentleman a favorite with king james and afterward earl of somerset such was the warmth of friendship in which these two gentlemen lived that they were inseparable carre could enter into no scheme nor pursue any measures without the advice and concurrence of overbury nor could overbury enjoy any felicity but in the company of him he loved their friendship was the subject of courtconversation and their genius seemed so much alike that it was reasonable to suppose no breach could ever be produced between them but such it seems is the power of woman such the influence of beauty that even the sacred ties of friendship are broke asunder by the magic energy of these superior charms carre fell in love with lady frances howard daughter to the earl of suffolk and lately divorced from the earl of essex winst ubi supra  he communicated his passion to his friend who was too penetrating not to know that no man could live with much comsort with a woman of the countesss stamp of whose morals he had a bad opinion he insinuated to carre some suspicions and those well founded against her honor he dissuaded him with all the warmth of the sincerest friendship to desist from a match that would involve him in misery and not to suffer his passion for her beauty to have so much sway over him as to make him sacrifice his peace to its indulgence  carre who was desperately in love forgetting the ties of honor as well as friendship communicated to the lady what overbury had said of her and they who have read the heart of woman will be at no loss to conceive what reception she gave that unwelcome report she knew that carre was immoderately attached to overbury that he was directed by his council in all things and devoted to his interest  earth has no curse like love to hatred turned nor hell a fury like a woman scorned this was literally verified in the case of the countess she let loose all the rage of which she was capable against him and as she panted for the consummation of the match between carre and her she so influenced the viscount that he began to conceive a hatred likewise to overbury and while he was thus subdued by the charms of a wicked woman he seemed to change his nature and from the gentle easy accessible goodnatured man he formerly appeared he degenerated into the sullen vindictive and implacable one thing with respect to the countess ought not to be omitted she was wife of the famous earl of essex who afterward headed the army of the parliament against the king and to whom the imputation of impotence was laid the countess in order to procure a divorce from her husband gave it out that though she had been for some time in a married state she was yet a virgin and which it seems sat very uneasy upon her to prove this a jury of matrons were to examine her and give their opinion whether she was or was not a virgin this scrutiny the countess did not care to undergo and therefore entreated the favor that she might enter masked to save her blushes this was granted her and she took care to have a young lady provided of much the same size and exterior appearance who personated her and the jury asserted her to be an unviolated virgin this precaution in the countess no doubt diminishes her character and is a circumstance not favorable to her honor for if her husband had been really impotent as she pretended she needed not have been afraid of the search and it proves that she either injured her husband by falsely aspersing him or that she had violated her honor with other men but which ever of these causes prevailed had the countess been wise enough she had no occasion to fear the consequences of a scrutiny for if i am rightly informed a jury of old women can no more judge accurately whether a woman has yielded her virginity than they can by examining a dead body know of what distemper the deceased died but be that as it may the whole affair is unfavourable to her modesty it shows her a woman of irregular passions which poor sir thomas overbury dearly experienced for even after the countess was happy in the embraces of the earl of somerset she could not forbear the persecution of him she procured that sir thomas should be nominated by the king to go ambassador to russia a destination she knew would displease him it being then no better than a kind of honorable grave she likewise excited earl somerset to sem again his friend and to advise him strongly to refuse the embassy and at the same time ininuate that if he should it would only be lying a few weeks in the tower which to a man well provided in all the necessaries as well as comforts of life had no great terror in it this expedient sir thomas embraced and absolutely refused to go abroad upon which on the twentyfirst of april      he was sent prisoner to the tower and put under the care of sir gervis yelvis then lord lieutenant the coutess being so far successful began now to conceive great hopes of completing her scheme of assassination and drew over the earl of somerset her husband to her party and he who a few years before had obtained the honor of knighthood for overbury was now so enraged against him that he coincided in taking measures to murder his friend sir gervis yelvis who obtained the lieutenancy by somersets interest was a creature devoted to his pleasure he was a needy man totally destitute of any principles of honor and was easily prevailed upon to forward a scheme for destroying poor overbury by poison accordingly they consulted with one mrs turner the first inventer says winstanley of that horrid garb of yellow ruffs and cuffs and in which garb she was afterward hanged who having acquaintance with one james franklin a man who it seems was admirably fitted to be a cutthroat agreed with him to provide that which would not kill presently but cause one to languish away by degrees the lieutenant being engaged in the conspiracy admits one weston mrs turners man who under pretense of waiting on sir thomas was to do the horrid deed the plot being thus formed and success promising so fair franklin buys various poisons white arsenick mercurysublimate cantharides redmercury with three or four other deadly ingredients which he delivered to weston with instructions how to use them who put them into his broth and meat increasing and diminishing their strength according as he saw him affected besides these the countess sent him by way of present poisoned tarts and jellies but overbury being of a strong constitution held long out against their influence his body broke out in blotches and blains which occasioned the report industriously propagated by somerset of his having died of the french disease at last they produced his death by the application of a poisoned clyster by which he next day in painful agonies expired thus says winstanley by the malice of a woman that worthy knight was murdered who yet still lives in that witty poem of his entitled a wife as is well expressed by the verses under his picture a mans best fortune or his worsts a wife yet i that knew no marriage peace nor strife live by a good one by a bad one lost my life   of all crimes which the heart of man conceives as none is so enormous as murder so it more frequently meets punishment in this life than any other this barbarous assassination was soon revealed for notwithstanding what the conspirators had given out suspicions ran high that sir thomas was poisoned upon which weston was strictly examined by lord cook who before his lordship persisted in denying the same but the bishop of london afterward conversing with him pressing the thing home to his conscience and opening all the terrors of another life to his mind he was moved to confess the whole he related how mrs turner and the countess became acquainted and discovered all those who were any way concerned in it upon which they were all apprehended and some sent to newgate and others to the tower having thus confessed and being convicted according to due course of law he was hanged at tyburn after him mrs turner after her franklin then sir gervis yelvis being found guilty on their several arraignments were executed some of them died penitent the earl and the countess were both condemned but notwithstanding their guilt being greater than any of the other criminals the king to the astonishment of all his subjects forgave them but they were both forbid to appear at court  there was something strangely unaccountable in the behavior of somerset after condemnation when he was asked what he thought of his condition and if he was preparing to die he answered that he thought not of it at all for he was sure the king durst not command him to be executed this ridiculous boasting and bidding defiance to his majestys power was construed by some in a very odd manner and there were not wanting those who asserted that somerset was privy to a secret of the kings which if it had been revealed would have produced the strangest consternation in the kingdom that ever was known and drawn down infamy upon his majesty for ever but as nothing can be ascertained concerning it it might seem unfair to impute to this silly prince more auls than he perhaps committed it is certain he was the slave of his favorites and not the most shocking crime in them it seems could entirely alienate his affections and it is doubtful whether the saving of somerset or the execution of raleigh reflects most disgrace upon his reign some have said that the body of sir thomas overbury was thrown into an obscure pit but wood says it appears from the tower registers that it was interred in the chapel which seems more probable there is an epitaph which winstanley has preserved written by our author upon himself which i shall here insert as it serves to illustrate his versification the span of my days measured here i rest that is my body but my soul his guest is hence ascended whither neither time nor faith nor hope but only love can climb where being new enlightened she does know the truth of all men argue of below only this dust does here in pawn remain that when the world dissolves she come again   the works of overbury besides his wife which is reckoned the wittiest and most finished of all are first characters or witty descriptions of the prophesies of sundry persons this piece has relation to some characters of his own time which can afford little satisfaction to a modern reader second the remedy of love in two parts a poem    0 octavo   s third observations in his travels on the state of the seventeen provinces as they stood anno   0  fourth observations on the provinces united and the state of france printed london      sir thomas was about    years old when he was murdered and is said to have possessed an accuteness and strength of parts that was astonishing and some have related that he was proud of his abilities and overbearing in company but as there is no good authority for the assertion it is more agreeable to candor to believe him the amiable knight winstanley draws him as it seldom happens that a soul formed for the noble quality of friendship is haughty and insolent there is a tragedy of sir thomas overbury wrote by the late richard savage son of earl rivers which was acted in      by what was then usually called the summer company with success of which we shall speak more at large in the life of that unfortunate gentleman  john marsten there are few things on record concerning this poets life wood says that he was a student in corpuschristi college oxon but in what country he was born or of what family descended is no where sixed mr langbain says he can recover no other information of him than what he learned from the testimony of his bookseller which is that he was free from all obscene speeches which is the chief cause of making plays odious to virtuous and modest persons but he abhorred such writes and their works and professed himself an enemy to all such as stuffed their scenes with ribaldry and larded their lines with scurrilous taunts and jests so that whatsoever even in the spring of his years he presented upon the private and public theater in his autumn and declining age he needed not to to be ashamed of he lived in friendship with the famous ben johnson as appears by his addressing to his name a tragicomedy called malcontent but we afterward find him reflecting pretty severely on ben on account of his cataline and sejanus as the reader will find on the perusal of marstens epistle prefixed to sophonisba  know says he that i have not labored in this poem to relate any thing as an historian but to enlarge every thing as a poet to transcribe authors quote authorities and to translate latin prose orations into english blank verse has in this subject been the least aim of my studies  langbain observes that none who are acquainted with the works of johnson can doubt that he is meant here if they will compare the orations in salust with those in cataline on what provocation marsten thus censured his friend is unknown but the practice has been too frequently pursued so true is it as mr gay observes of the wits that they are often game cocks to one another and sometimes verify the couplet that they are still prepared to praise or to abhor us satire they have and panegyric for us    marsten has contributed eight plays to the stage which were all acted at the black friars with applause and one of them called the dutch courtezan was once revived since the restoration under the title of the revenge or a match in the late mr c bullock a comedian and some time manager of lincolnsinnfields theater made a play from that piece newgate in the year      six of this authors plays were collated and published in one volume and dedicated to the lady viscountess

printed in octavo several years before the new edition dutch courtezan a comedy frequently played at black friars by the children of the queens revels printed in london      it is taken from a french

werdenberg duchess of ulme male content a tragicomedy dedicated to old ben as i have already taken notice in which he heaps many fine epithets upon him the first design of this play was laid by mr

raleigh in his history of the world b     besides his dramatic poetry he writ three books of satires entitled the scourge of villainy printed in octavo london      we have no account in what year our author died but we find that his works were published after his death by the great shakespeare and it may perhaps be reasonably concluded that it was about the year       william shakespeare there have been some ages in which providence seemed pleased in a most remarkable manner to display it self in giving to the world the finest geniuss to illuminate a people formerly barbarous after a long night of gothic ignorance after many ages of priestcraft and superstition learning and genius visited our island in the days of the renowned queen elizabeth it was then that liberty began to dawn and the people having shook off the restraints of priestly austerity presumed to think for themselves at an era so remarkable as this so famous in his story it seems no wonder that the nation should be blessed with those immortal ornaments of wit and learning who all conspired at once to make it famous  this astonishing genius seemed to be commissioned from above to deliver us not only from the ignorance under which we labored as to poetry but to carry poetry almost to its perfection but to write a panegyric on shakespeare appears as unnecessary as the attempt would be vain for whoever has any taste for what is great terrible or tender may meet with the amplest gratification in shakespeare as may those also have a taste for drollery and true humor his genius was almost boundless and he succeeded alike in every part of writing i cannot forbear giving the character of shakespeare in the words of a great genius in a prologue spoken by mr garrick when he first opened drury lane house as manager when learnings triumph over her barbarous foes first reared the stage  immortal shakespeare rose each change of manycoloured life he drew exhausted worlds and then imagined new existence saw him spurn her bounded reign and panting time toiled after him in vain   all men have discovered a curiosity to know the little stories and particularities of a great genius for it often happens that when we attend a man to his closet and watch his moments of solitude we shall find such expressions drop from him or we may observe such instances of peculiar conduct as will let us more into his real character than ever we can discover while we converse with him in public and when perhaps he appears under a kind of mask there are but few things known of this great man few incidents of his life have descended to posterity and though no doubt the fame of his abilities made a great noise in the age in which he flourished yet his station was not such as to produce many incidents as it was subject to but few vicissitudes mr row who well understood and greatly admired shakespeare has been at pains to collect what incidents were known or were to be found concerning him and it is chiefly upon mr rowes authority we build the account now given  our author was the son of john shakespeare and was born at stratford upon avon in warwickshire april    at it appears by public records relating to that town the family from which he is descended was of good figure and fashion there and are mentioned as gentlemen his father who was a considerable deaer in wool being encumbered with a large family of ten children could afford to give his eldest son but a slender education he had bred him at a free school where he acquired what latin he was master of but how well he understood that language or whether after his leaving the school he made greater proficiency in it has been disputed and is a point very difficult to settle however it is certain that mr john shakespeare our authors father was obliged to withdraw him early from school in order to have his assistance in his own employment toward supporting the rest of the family it is without controversy says row that in his works we scarce find any traces that look like an imitation of the ancients the delicacy of his taste and the natural bent of his own great genius equal if not superior to some of the best of theirs would certainly have led him to read and study them with so much pleasure that some of their fine images would naturally have insinuated themselves into and been mixed with his own writings so that his not copying at least something from them may be an argument of his never having read them whether his ignorance of the ancients was disadvantageous to him or no may admit of dispute for though the knowledge of them might have made him more correct yet it is not improbable but that the regularity and deference for them which would have attended that correctness might have restrained some of that fire impetuosity and even beautiful extravagance which we cannot help admiring in shakespeare  as to his want of learning mr pope makes the following just observation that there is certainly a vast difference between learning and languages how far he was ignorant of the latter i cannot says he determine but it is plain he had much reading at least if they will not call it learning nor is it any great matter if a man has knowledge whether he has it from one language or from another nothing is more evident than that he had a taste for natural philosophy mechanics ancient and modern history poetical learning and mythology we find him very knowing in the customs rites and manners of the romans in coriolanus and julius caesar not only the spirit but manners of the romans are exactly drawn and still a nicer distinction is shown between the manners of the romans in the time of the former and the latter his reading in the ancient historians is no less conspicuous in many references to particular passages and the speeches copied from plutarch in coriolanus may as well be made instances of his learning as those copied from cicero in the cataline of ben johnson the manners of other nations in general the egyptians venetians french etc are drawn with equal propriety whatever object of nature or branch of science he either speaks or dscribes it is always with competent if not extensive knowledge his descriptions are still exact and his metaphors appropriated and remarkably drawn from the nature and inherent qualities of each subject  we have translations from ovid published in his name among those poems which pass for his and for some of which we have undoubted authority being published by himself and dedicated to the earl of southampton he appears also to have been conversant with plautus from whence he has taken the plot of one of his plays he follows the greek authors and particularly dares phrygius in another although i will not pretend continues mr pope to say in what language he read them  mr warburton has strongly contended for shakespeares learning and has produced many imitation and parallel passages with ancient authors in which i am inclined to think him right and beg leave to produce few instances of it he always says mr warburton makes an ancient speak the language of an ancient so julius caesar act i scene ii  ye gods it does amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone   this noble image is taken from the olympic games this majestic world is a sine periphrasis of the roman empire majestic because the romans ranked themselves on a footing with kings and a world because they called their empire orbis romanus but the whole story seems to allude to caesars great exemplar alexander who when he was asked whether he would run the course of the olympic games replied yes if the racers were kings  so again in anthony and cleopatra act i scene i anthony says with an astonishing sublimity let rome in tyber melt and the wide arch of the razed empire fall taken from the roman custom of raising triumphal arches to perpetuate their victories  and again act iii scene iv octavia says to anthony of the difference between him and her brother  wars twixt you twain would be  as if the world should cleave and that slain men  should solder up the rest    this thought seems taken from the story of curtius leaping into the chasm in the forum in order to close it so that as that was closed by one roman if the whole world were to cleave romans only could solder it up the metaphor of soldering is extremely exact according to mr warburton for says he as metal is soldered up by metal that is more refined than that which it solders so the earth was to be soldered by men who are only a more refined earth  the manners of other nations in general the egyptians venetians french etc are drawn with equal propriety an instance of this shall be produced with regard to the venetians in the merchant of venice act iv scene i  his losses that have of late so huddled on his back enough to press a royal merchant down   we are not to imagine the word royal to be a random founding epither it is used with great propriety by the poet and designed to show him ell acquainted with the history of the people whom he here brings upon the stage for when the french and venetians in the beginning of the thirteenth century had won constantinople the french under the emperor henry endeavored to extend their conqests in the provinces of the grecian empire on the terra firma while the venetians being masters of the sea gave liberty to any subject of the republic who would fit out vessels to make themselves masters of the isles of the archipelago and other maritime places to enjoy their conquests in sovereignty only doing homage to the republic for their several principalities in pursuance of this license the sanudos the justiniani the grimaldi the summaripas and others all venetian merchants erected principalities in the several places of the archipelago and thereby became truly and properly royal merchants  but there are several places which one cannot forbear thinking a translation from classic writers  in the tempest act v scene ii prospero says  i have  called forth the mutinous winds and twixt the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted joves stout oak with his own bolt the strong basd promontory have i made shake and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar graves at my command have waked their sleepers opened and let them forth by my so potent art   so medea in ovids metamorphoses stantia concutio cantu freta nubila pello nubilaque induco ventos abigoque vocoque vivaque saxa sua convulsaque robora terra et sylvas moveo jubeoque tremiscere montes et mugire folum manesque exire sepulchris   but to return to the incidents of his life upon his quitting the grammar school he seems to have entirely devoted himself to that way of living which his father proposed and in order to settle in the world after a family manner thought fit to marry while he was yet very young his wife was the daughter of one hatchway said to have been a substantial yeoman in the neighborhood of stratford in this kind of domestic obscurity he continued for some time till by an unhappy instance of misconduct he was obliged to quit the place of his nativity and take shelter in london which luckily proved the occasion of displaying one of the greatest geniuss that ever was known in dramatic poetry he had the misfortuue to fall into ill company among these were some who made a frequent practice of deersealing and who engaged him more than once in robbing a park that belonged to sir thomas lucy of charlecot near stratford for which he was prosecated by that gentleman as he thought somewhat too severely and in order to revenge himself of this supposed ill usage he made a ballad upon him and tho this probably the first essay of his poetry be lost yet it is said to have been so very bitter that it redoubled the prosecution against him to that degree that he was obliged to leave his business and family for some time and shelter himself in london this sir thomas lucy was it is said afterward ridiculed by shakespeare under the well known character of justice shallow  it is at this time and upon this accident that he is said to have made his first acquaintance in the playhouse here i cannot forbear relating a story which sir william davenant told mr betterton who communicated it to mr row row told it mr pope and mr pope told it to dr newton the late editor of milton and from a gentleman who heard it from him it is here related  concerning shakespeares first appearance in the playhouse when he came to london he was without money and friends and being a stranger he knew not to whom to apply nor by what means to support himself  at that time coaches not being in use and as gentlemen were accustomed to ride to the playhouse shakespeare driven to the last necessity went to the playhouse door and picked up a little money by taking care of the gentlemens horses who came to the play he became eminent even in that profession and was taken notice of for his diligence and skill in it he had soon more business than he himself could manage and at last hired boys under him who were known by the name of shakespeares boys some of the players accidentally conversing with him found him so acute and master of so fine a conversation that struck therewith they and recommended him to the house in which he was first admitted in a very low station but he did not long remain so for he soon distinguished himself if not as an extraordinary actor at least as a fine writer his name is printed as the custom was in those times amongst those of the other players before some old plays but without any particular account of what sort of parts he used to play and mr row says that though he very carefully enquired he found the top of his performance was the ghost in his own hamlet i should have been much more pleased continues row to have learned from some certain authority which was the first play he writ it would be without doubt a pleasure to any man curious in things of this kind to see and know what was the first essay of a fancy like shakespeares the highest date which row has been able to trace is romeo and juliet in      when the author was thirtythree years old and richard ii and iii the next year viz the thirtyfourth of his age though the order of time in which his several pieces were written be generally uncertain yet there are passages in some few of them that seem to fix their dates so the chorus at the end of the fourth act of henry v by a compliment very handsomely turned to the earl of essex shows the play to have been written when that lord was general to the queen in ireland and his eulogium upon queen elizabeth and her successor king james in the latter end of his henry viii is a proof of that plays being written after the accession of the latter of these two princes to the throne of england whatever the particular times of his writing were the people of the age he lived in who began to grow wonderfully fond of diversions of this kind could not but be highly pleased to see a genius arise amongst them of so pleasurable so rich a vein and so plentifully capable of furnishing their favorite entertainments besides the advantage which shakespeare had over all men in the article of wit he was of a sweet gentle amiable disposition and was a most agreeable companion so that he became dear to all that knew him both as a friend and as a poet and by that means was introduced to the best company and held conversation with the finest characters of his time queen elizabeth had several of his plays acted before her and that princess was too quick a discerner and rewarder of merit to suffer that of shakespeare to be neglected it is that maiden princess plainly whom he intends by  a fair vestal throned by the west midsummer night dream  and in the same play he gives us a poetical and lively representation of the queen of scots and the fate she met with  thou remembrest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a seamaid on a dolphins back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the seamaids music   queen elizabeth was so well pleased with the admirable character of falstaff in the two parts of henry iv that she commanded him to continue it in one play more and to make him in love this is said to have been the occasion of his writing the merry wives of windsor how well she was obeyed the play itself is a proof and here i cannot help observing that a poet seldom succeeds in any subject assigned him so well as that which is his own choice and where he has the liberty of selecting nothing is more certain than that shakespeare has failed in the merry wives of windsor and though that comedy is not without merit yet it falls short of his other plays in which falstaff is introduced and that knight is not half so witty in the merry wives of windsor as in henry iv the humor is scarcely natural and does not exciteto laughter so much as the other it appears by the epilogue to henry iv that the part of falstaff was written originally under the name of oldcastle some of that family being then remaining the queen was pleased to command him to alter it upon which he made use of the name of falstaff the first offense was indeed avoided but i am not sure whether the author might not be somewhat to blame in his second choice since it is certain that sir john falstaff who was a knight of the garter and a lieutenant general was a name of distinguished merit in the wars with france in henry v and henry viths time  shakespeare besides the queens bounty was patronized by the earl of southampton famous in the history of that time for his friendship to the unfortunate earl of essex it was to that nobleman he dedicated his poem of venus and adonis and it is reported that his lordship gave our author a thousand pounds to enable him to go through with a purchase he heard he had a mind to make a bounty at that time very considerable as money then was valued there are few instances of such liberality in our tmes  there is no certain account when shakespeare quitted the stage for a private life some have thought that spensers thalia in the tears of the muses where she laments the loss of her willy in the comic scene relates to our poets abandoning the stage but it is well known that spenser himself died in the year      and five years after this we find shakespeares name amongst the actors in ben johnsons sejanus which first made its appearance in the year   0  nor could he then have any thoughts of retiring since that very year a license by king james the first was granted to him with burbage philipps hemmings condel etc to exercise the art of playing comedies tragedies etc as well at their usual house called the globe on the other side the water as in any other parts of the kingdom during his majestys pleasure this license is printed in rymers faedera besides it is certain shakespeare did not write macbeth till after the accession of james i which he did as a compliment to him as he there embraces the doctrine of witches of which his majesty was so fond that he wrote a book called daemonalogy in defense of their existence and likewise at that time began to touch for the evil which shakespeare has taken notice of and paid him a fine turned compliment so that what spenser there says if it relates at all to shakespeare must hint at some occasional recess which he made for a time  what particular friendships he contracted with private men we cannot at this time know more than that every one who had a true taste for merit and could distinguish men had generally a just value and esteem for him his exceeding candor and good nature must certainly have inclined all the gentler part of the world to love him as the power of his wit obliged the men of the most refined knowledge and polite learning to admire him his acquaintance with ben johnson began with a remarkable piece of humanity and good nature mr johnson who was at that time altogether unknown to the world had offered one of his plays to the stage in order to have it acted and the person into whose hands it was put after having turned it care lessly over was just upon returning it to him with an illnatured answer that it would be of no service to their company when shakespeare luckily cast his eye upon it and found something so well in it as to engage him first to read it through and afterward to recommend mr johnson and his writings to the public  the latter part of our authors life was spent in ease and retirement he had the good fortune to gather an estate equal to his wants and in that to his wish and is said to have spent some years before his death in his native stratford his pleasant wit and good nature engaged him in the acquaintance and entitled him to the friendship of the gentlemen of the neighborhood it is still remembered in that county that he had a particular intimacy with one mr comb an old gentleman noted thereabouts for his wealth and usury it happened that in a pleasant conversation amongst their common friends mr comb merrily told shakespeare that he fancied he intended to write his epitaph if he happened to outlive him and since he could not know what might be said of him when dead he desired it might be done immediately upon which shakespeare gave him these lines ten in the hundred lies here engraved it is a hundred to ten his soul is not saved if any man asks who lies in this tomb oh oh quoth the devil it is my johnacombe   but the sharpness of the satire is said to have stung the man so severely that he never forgave it  shakespeare died in the fiftythird year of his age and was buried on the north side of the chancel in the great church at stratford where a monument is placed on the wall the following is the inscription on his gravestone good friend for jesus sake forbear to dig the dust enclosed here blessed be the man that spares these stones and cursed be he that moves my bones   he had three daughters of whom two lived to be married judith the elder to mr thomas quincy by whom she had three sons who all died without children and susannah who was his favorite to dr john hall a physician of good reputation in that county she left one child a daughter who was married to thomas nash esquire and afterward to sir john bernard of abington but deceased likewise without issue  his dramatic writings were first published together in folio      by some of the actors of the different companies they had been acted in and perhaps by other servants of the theater into whose hands copies might have fallen and since republished by mr row mr pope mr theobald sir thomas hanmer and mr warburton  ben johnson in his discoveries has made a sort of essay toward the character of shakespeare i shall present it the reader in his own words i remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to shakespeare that in writing he never blotted out a line my answer has been would he had blotted out a thousand which they thought a malevolent speech i had not told posterity this but for their ignorance who choose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most faulted and to justify my own character for i loved the man and do honor to his memory on this side idolatry as much as any he was indeed honest and of an open free nature had an excellent fancy brave notions and gentle expressions wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped his wit was in his own power would the rule of it had been so many times he fell into those things which could not escape laughter as when he said in the person of caesar one speaking to him  caesar thou do me wrong  he replied caesar did never wrong but with just cause  and such like which were ridiculous but he redeemed his vices with his virtues there was ever more in them to be praised than to be pardoned ben in his conversation with mr drumond of hawthornden said that shakespeare wanted art and sometimes sense the truth is ben was himself a better critic than poet and though he was ready at discovering the faults of shakespeare yet he was not master of such a genius as to rise to his excellencies and great as johnson was he appears not a little tinctured with envy notwithstanding the defects of shakespeare he is justly elevated above all other dramatic writers if ever any author deserved the name of original says pope it was he preface to shakespeare his poetry was inspiration indeed he is not so much an imitator as instrument of nature and it is not so just to say of him that he speaks from her as that she speaks through him his characters are so much nature herself that it is a sort of injury to call them by so distant a name as copies of her the power over our passions was likewise never possessed in so eminent a degree or displayed in so many different instances nor was he more a master of the great than of the ridiculous in human nature nor only excelled in the passions since he was full as admirable in the coolness of reflection and reasoning his sentiments are not only in general the most pertinent and judicious upon every subject but by a talent very peculiar something between penetration and felicity he hits upon that particular point on which the bent of each argument or the force of each motive depends  our authors plays are to be distinguished only into comedies and tragedies those which are called histories and even some of his comedies are really tragedies with a mixture of comedy amongst them that way of tragicomedy was the common mistake of that age and is indeed become so agreeable to the english taste that though the severer critics among us cannot bear it yet the generality of our audiences seem better pleased with it than an exact tragedy there is certainly a great deal of entertainment in his comic humors and a pleasing and well distinguished variety in those characters he thought fit to exhibit with his images are indeed every where so lively that the thing he would represent stands full before you and you possess every part of it of which this instance is astonishing it is an image of patience speaking of a maid in love he says  she never told her love but let concealment like a worm ithbud feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought and sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief   but what is characteristically the talent of shakespeare and which perhaps is the most excellent part of the drama is the manners of his persons in acting and in speaking what is proper for them and fit to be shown by the poet in making an apparent difference between his characters and marking every one in the strongest manner  poets who have not a little succeeded in writing for the stage have yet fallen short of their great original in the general power of the drama none ever found so ready a road to the heart his tender scenes are inexpressibly moving and such as are meant to raise terror are no less alarming but then shakespeare does not much shine when he is considered by particular passages he sometimes debases the noblest images in nature by expressions which are too vulgar for poetry the ingenious author of the rambler has observed that in the invocation of macbeth before he proceeds to the murder of duncan when he thus expresses himself  come thick night and veil thee in the dunnest smoke of hell nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry hold hold that the words dunnest and blanket which are so common in vulgar mouths destroy in some manner the grandeur of the image and were two words of a higher signification and removed above common use put in their place i may challenge poetry itself to surnish an image so noble poets of an inferior class when considered by particular passages are excellent but then their ideas are not so great their drama is not so striking and it is plain enough that they possess not souls so elevated as shakespeares what can be more beautiful than the flowing enchantments of row the delicate and tender touches of otway and southern or the melting enthusiasm of lee and dryden but yet none of their pieces have affected the human heart like shakespeares  but i cannot conclude the character of shakespeare without taking notice that besides the suffrage of almost all wits since his time in his favor he is particularly happy in that of dryden who had read and studied him clearly sometimes borrowed from him and well knew where his strength lay in his prologue to the tempest altered he has the following lines shakespeare who taught by none did first impart to fletcher wit to laboring johnson art he monarchlike gave there his subjects law and is that nature which they paint and draw fletcher reached that which on his heights did grow while johnson crept and gathered all below this did his love and this his mirth digest one imitates him most the other best if they have since outwrit all other men it is from the drops which fell from shakespeares pen the alluding to the sea voyage of fletcher storm which vanished on the neighboring shore was taught by shakespeares tempest first to roar that innocence and beauty which did smile in fletcher grew in this enchanted isle but shakespeares magic could not copied be within that circle none durst walk but he   the plays of this great author which are fortythree in number are as follows   the tempest a comedy acted in the black friars with applause   the two gentlemen of verona a comedy writ at the command of queen elizabeth   the first and second

in the end of elizabeth and king jamess reign he was called by the poets in his time the silvertongud sylvester but it is doubtful whether he received any academical education in his early years he is reported to have been a merchant adventurer athenae oxon p      queen elizabeth is said to have had a respect for him her successor still a greater and prince henry greater than his father the prince so valued our bard that he made him his first poetpensioner he was not mre celebrated for his poetry than his extraordinary private virtues his sobriety and sincere attachment to the duties of religion he was also remarkable for his fortitude and resolution in combating adversity we are further told that he was perfectly acquainted with the french italian latin dutch and spanish languages and it is related of him that by endeavoring to correct the vices of the times with too much asperity he exposed himself to the resentment of those in power who signified their displeasure to the mortification and trouble of the author our poet gained more reputation by the translation of du bartas than by any of his own compositions besides his weeks and works he translated several other productions of that author namely winst lives of the poets p  0  eden the deceit the furies the handicrafts the ark babylon the colonies the columns the fathers jonas urania triumph of faith miracle of peace the vocation the daw the captains the trophies the magnisicence etc also a paradox of odes de la nove baron of teligni with the quadrians of pibeac all which translations were generally well received but for his own works which were bound up with them they received not says winstanley so general an approbation as may be seen by these verses we know thou do well as a translator but where things require a genius and fire not kindled before by others pains as often thou have wanted brains   in the year      this author died at middleburgh in zealand aged    years and had the following

genius inclining him more to studies of a gayer and softer kind he quitted the university and applied himself to history and poetry his own merit added to the recommendation of his brother in law john florio so well known for his italian dictionary procured him the patronage of queen anne the consort of king james i who was pleased to confer on him the honor of being one of the grooms of the privychamber which enabled him to rent a house near london where privately he composed many of his dramatic pieces he was tutor to lady ann clifford and on the death of the great spenser he was appointed poet laureat to queen elizabeth toward the end of his life he retired to a farm which he had at beckington near philipsnorton in somersetshire where after some time spent in the service of

a defense of rhyme all these pieces are published together in two volumes   mo under the title of the poetical pieces of mr samuel daniel   but however well qualified our authors genius was for poetry yet langbain is of opinion that his history is the crown of all his works it was printed about the year      and dedicated to queen anne it reaches from the state of britain under the romans to the beginning of the reign of richard ii his history has received encomiums from various hands as well as his poetry it was continued by john trusul with like brevity and candor but not with equal elegance till the reign of richard iii a d      mr daniel lived respected by men of worth and fashion he passed through life without tasting many of the vicissitudes of fortune he seems to have been a second rate genius and a tolerable versifier his poetry in some places is tender but want of fire is his characteristical fault he was unhappy in the choice of his subject of a civil war for a poem which obliged him to descend to minute descriptions and nothing merely narrative can properly be touched in poetry which demands flights of the imagination and bold images  sir john harrington born at kelston near the city of bath was the son of john harrington esquire who was imprisoned in the tower in the reign of queen mary for holding a correspondence with the lady elizabeth with whom he was in great favor after her accession to the crown and received many testimonies of her bounty and gratitude sir john our author had the honor to be her godson and both in respect to his fathers merit and his own he was so happy to possess her esteem to the last muses library p      he had the rudiments of his education at eaton thence removing to cambridge he there commenced master of arts and before he arrived at his  0th year he favored the world with a translation of the orlando furioso of ariosto by which he acquired some reputation after this work he composed four books of epigrams which in thsemes were received with great applause several of these mention another humorous piece of his called misacmos metamorphosis which for a while exposed him to her majestys resentment yet he was afterward received into favor this says mrs cooper is not added to the rest of his works and therefore she supposes was only meant for a court amusement not the entertainment of the public or the increase of his same in the reign of king james i he was created knight of the bath ubi supra  and presented a manuscript to prince henry called a brief view of the state of the church of england as it stood in queen elizabeth and king jamess reign in the year   0  this piece was levelled chiefly against the married bishops and was intended only for the private use of his highness but was some years afterward published by one of sir johns grandsons and occasioned much displeasure from the clergy who did not fail to recollect that his conduct was of a piece with his doctrines as he together with robert earl of leicester supported sir walter raleigh in his suit to queen elizabeth for the manor of banwell belonging to the bishopric of bath and wells on the presumption that the right reverend incumbent had incurred a praemunire by marrying a second wife  sir john appears to be a gentleman of great pleasantry and humor his fortune was easy the court his element and which is ever an advantage to an author wit was not his business but diversion it is not to be doubted but his translation of ariosto was published after spensers fairy queen and yet both in language and numbers it is much inferior as much as it is reasonable to suppose the genius of harrington was below that of spenser  mrs cooper remarks that the whole poem of orlando is a tedious medley of unnatural characters and improbable events and that the authors patron cardinal hippolito de este had some reason for that severe question where the devil signior ludovico did you pick up all these damned lies the genius of ariosto seems infinitely more fit for satire than heroic poetry and some are of opinion that had harrington wrote nothing but epigrams he had been more in his own way  we cannot certainly fix the time that sir john died but it is reasonable to suppose that it was about the middle or rather toward the latter end of james is reign i shall subjoin an epigram of his as a specimen of his poetry in cornutum what curldpate youth is he that sits there so near thy wife and whispers in her ear and takes her hand in his and soft does wring her sliding his ring still up and down her finger sir it is a proctor seen in both the laws retained by her in some important cause prompt and discreet both in his speech and action and does her business with great satisfaction and think thou so a hornplague on thy head art thou so like a fool and wittol led to think he does the business of thy wife he does thy business i dare lay my life   thomas decker a poet who lived in the reign of king james i and as he was cotemporary with ben johnson so he became more eminent by having a quarrel with that great man than by all his works decker was but an indifferent poet yet even in those days he wanted not his admirers he had also friends among the poets one of whom mr richard brom always called him father but it is the misfortune of little wits that their admirers are as inconsiderable as themselves for bromes applauses confer no great honor on those who enjoy them our author joined with webster in writing three plays and with rowley and ford in another and langbaine asserts that these plays in which he only contributed a part far exceed those of his own composition he has been concerned in eleven plays eight whereof are of his own writing of all which i shall give an account in their alphabetical order i fortunatus a comedy printed originally in  to but with what success or when acted i cannot gain any account ii honest whore the first part a comedy with the humors of the patient man and the longing wife acted by the queens servants      iii honest whore the second part a comedy with the humors of the patient man the impatient wife the honest whore persuaded by strong arguments to turn courtezan again her refusing those arguments and lastly the comical passage of an italian bridewel where the scene ends printed in  to london    0 this play langbaine thinks was never exhibited neither is it divided into acts iv if this be not a good play the devil is in it a comedy acted with great applause by the queens majestys servants at the redbull and dedicated to the actors the beginning of this play seems to be writ in imitation of machiavels novel of belphegor where pluto summons the devils to council match me in london a tragicomedy often presented first at the bullshead in st johnsstreet and then at a private house in drury lane called the phoenix printed in  to in      vi northward ho a comedy often acted by the children of pauls printed in  to london   0  this play was writ by our author and john webster vii satyromastix or the untrussing the humourous poet a comical satire presented publicly by the lord chamberlains servants and privately by the children of pauls printed in  to   0  and dedicated to the world this play was writ on the occasion of ben johnsons poetaster for some account of which see the life of johnson viii westward ho this was revived in the year      at drury lane theater on the lord mayors day in the room of the london cuckolds which is now discontinued at that house a comedy often acted by the children of pauls and printed in  to   0  written by our author and mr webster ix whore of babylon an history acted by the princes servants and printed in  to london   0  the design of this play by feigned names is to set forth the admirable virtues of queen elizabeth and the dangers she escaped by the happy discovery of those designs against her sacred person by the jesuits and bigoted papists x wyatts history a play said to be writ by him and webster and printed in  to the subject of this play is sir thomas wyat of kent who made an insurrection in the first year of queen mary to prevent her match with philip of spain   besides these plays he joined with rowley and ford in a play called the witch of edmonton of which see rowley  there are four other plays ascribed to our author in which he is said by mr phillips and winstanley to be an associate with john webster viz noble stranger new trick to cheat the devil weakest goes to the wall woman will have her will in all which langbaine asserts they are mistaken for the first was written by lewis sharp and the other by anonymous authors  beaumont and fletcher were two famous dramatists in the reign of james i these two friends were so closely united as authors and are so jointly concerned in the applauses and censures bestowed upon their plays that it cannot be thought improper to connect their lives under one article  mr francis beaumont was descended from the ancient family of his name seated at grace dieu in leicestershire jacobs lives of the poets and was born about the year      in the reign of queen elizabeth his grandfather john beaumont was master of the rolls and his father francis beaumont one of the judges of the common pleas our poet had his education at cambridge wood but of what college we are not informed nor is it very material to know we find him afterward admitted a student in the inner temple but we have no account of his making any proficiency in the law which is a circumstance attending almost all the poets who were bred to that profession which few men of sprightly genius care to be confined to before he was thirty years of age he died in      and was buried the ninth of the same month in the entrance of st benedictines chapel within st peters westminster we meet with no inscription on his tomb but there are two epitaphs writ on him one by his elder brother sir john beaumont and the other by bishop corbet that by his brother is pretty enough and is as follows on death thy murderer this revenge i take i slight his terror and just question make which of us two the best precedence have mine to this wretched world thine to the grave thou should have followed me but death to blame miscounted years and measured age by fame so dearly have thou bought thy precious lines thy praise grew swiftly so thy life declines thy muse the hearers queen the readers love all ears all hearts but deaths could please and move   our poet left behind him one daughter mrs frances beaumont who lived to a great age and died in leicestershire since the year   00 she had been possessed of several poems of her fathers writing but they were lost at sea in her voyage from ireland where she had lived sometime in the duke of ormonds family besides the plays in which beaumont was jointly concerned with fletcher he writ a little dramatic piece entitled a masque of grays inn gentlemen and the inner temple a poetical epistle to ben johnson verses to his friend mr john fletcher upon his faithful shepherd and other poems printed together in       vo that pastoral which was written by fletcher alone having met with but an indifferent reception beaumont addressed the follwing copy of verses to him on that occasion in which he represents the hazard of writing for the stage and satirizes the audience for want of judgment which in order to show his versification i shall insert why should the man whose wit never had a stain upon the public stage present his vein and make a thousand men in judgment sit to call in question his undoubted wit scarce two of which can understand the laws which they should judge by nor the partys cause among the rout there is not one that has in his own censure an explicit faith one company knowing thy judgment jack ground their belief on the next man in black others on him that makes signs and is mute some like as he does in the fairest suit he as his mistress does and she by chance nor want there those who as the boy does dance between the acts will censure the whole play some if the waxlights be not new that day but multitudes there are whose judgment goes headlong according to the actors clothes   mr beaumont was esteemed so accurate a judge of plays that been johnson while he lived submitted all his writings to his censures and it is thought used his judgment in correcting if not contriving most of his plots  mr john fletcher was son of dr richard fletcher lord bishop of london and was born in northamptonshire in the year      he was educated at cambridge probably at burnetcollege to which his father was by his last will and testament a benefactor langbaines lives of the poets  he wrote plays jointly with mr beaumont and wood says he assisted ben johnson in a comedy called the widow after beaumonts death it is said he consulted mr james shirley in forming the plots of several of his plays but which those were we have no means of disovering the editor of beaumont and fletchers plays in      thinks it very probable that shirley supplied many that were left imperfect and that the players gave some remains of fletchers for shirley to make up and it is from hence he says that in the first act of loves pilgrimage there is a scene of an ostler transcribed verbatim out of ben johnsons new inn act i scene i which play was written long after fletcher died and transplanted into loves pilgrimage after printing the new inn which was in the year    0 and two of the plays printed under fletchers name the coronation and the little thief have been claimed by shirley as his it is probable they were left imperfect by the one and finished by the other mr fletcher died of the plague in the forty ninth year of his age the first of king charles i an      and was buried in st mary overys church in southwark  beaumont and fletcher as has been observed wrote plays in concert but what share each bore in forming the plots writing the scenes etc is unknown the general opinion is that beaumonts judgment was usually employed in correcting and retrenching the superfluities of fletchers wit whose fault was as mr cartwright expresses it to do too much but if winstanley may be credited the former had his share likewise in the drama for that author relates that our poets meeting once at a tavern in order to form the rude draught of a tragedy fletcher undertook to kill the king which words being overheard by a waiter he was officious enough in order to recommend himself to lodge an information against them but their loyalty being unquestioned and the relation of the circumstance probable that the vengeance was only aimed at a theatrical monarch the affair ended in a jest  the first play which brought them into esteem as dryden says was philaster or love lies a bleeding for before that they had written two or three very unsuccessfully as the like is reported of ben johnson before he writ every man in his humor these authors had with the advantage of the wit of shakespeare which was their precedent great natural gifts improved by study their plots are allowed generally more regular than shakespeares they touch the tender passions and excite love in a very moving manner their faults notwithstanding beaumonts castigation consist in a certain luxuriance and stretching their speeches to an immoderate length there is a coarseness of dialogue even in their genteelest characters in comedy that appears now almost unpardonable one is almost inclined to think the language and manners of those times were not overpolite this fault appears so frequent nor is the great shakespeare entirely to be acquitted hereof however it must be owned their wit is great their language suited to the passions they raise and the age in which they lived is a sufficient apology for their defects mr dryden tells us in his essay on dramatic poetry that beaumont and fletchers plays in his time were the most pleasing and frequent entertainments of the stage two of theirs being acted through the year for one of shakespeares or johnsons and the reason he assigns is because there is a certain gaiety in their comedies and a pathos in their most serious plays which suits generally with all mens humors but however it might be when dryden writ the case is now reversed for beaumont and fletchers plays are not acted above once a season while one of shakespeares is represented almost every third night it may seem strange that wits of the first magnitude should not be so much honored in the age in which they live as by posterity may not this be owing to envy are not most wits jealous of their cotemporaries how readily do we pay adoration to the dead how slowly do we give even faint praise to the living is it a wonder beaumont and fletcher were more praised and versified than shakespeare were not inferior wits opposed nay preferred to drypen while living was not this the case of addison and pope whose works those authors being no more will be read with admiration and allowed the just preeminence while the english tongue is understood it is now fashionable to be in raptures with shakespeare editions are multiplied upon editions and men of the greatest genius have employed all their power in illustrating his beauties which ever grow upon the reader and gain ground upon perusal these noble authors have received incense of praise from the highest pens they were loved and esteemed by their cotemporaries who have not failed to demonstrate their respect by various copies of verses at different times and upon different occasions addressed to them the insertion of which would exceed the bounds proposed for this work i shall only observe that amongst the illustrious names of their admirers are denham waller cartwright ben johnson sir john berkenhead and dryden himself a name more than equal to all the rest but the works of our authors have not escaped the censure of critics especially mr rhymer the historiographer who was really a man of wit and judgment but somewhat ill natured for he has labored to expose the faults without taking any notice of the beauties of rollo duke of normandy the king and no king and the maids tragedy in a piece of his called the tragedies of the last age considered and examined by the practice of the ancients and by the common sense of all ages in a letter to fleetwood shepherd esquire mr rymer sent one of his books as a present to mr dryden who in the blank leaves before the beginning and after the end of the book made several remarks as if he intended to publish an answer to that critic and his opinion of the work was this preface to fletchers plays  my judgment says he of this piece is that it is extremely learned but the author seems better acquainted with the greek than the english poets that all writers ought to study this critic as the best account i have seen of the ancients that the model of tragedy he has here given is extremely correct but that it is not the only model of tragedy because it is too much circumscribed in the plot characters etc and lastly that we may be taught here justly to admire and imitate the ancients without giving them the preference with this author in prejudice to our own country  some of beaumont and fletchers plays were printed in quarto during the lives of their authors and in the year      twenty years after fletchers death there was published in folio a collection of their plays which had not been printed before amounting to between thirty and forty at the beginning of this volume are inserted a great number of commendatory verses written by the most eminent wits of that age this collection was published by mr shirley after shutting up the theaters and dedicated to the earl of pembroke by ten of the most famous actors in      there was an edition of all their plays published in folio another edition in      by tonson in seven volumes  vo containing all the verses in praise of the authors and supplying a large omission of part of the last act of thierry and theodoret there was also another edition in       the plays of our authors are as follow   beggars bush a comedy

ascertained he made his first appearance at the university of oxford about the year      and was afterward a scholar under the learned mr edward hobye of trinity college where says wood making very early advances his ingenuity began first to be observed in several of his poetical compositions after he had taken one degree in arts and dedicated some time to reading the bards of antiquity he gained some reputation in poetry particularly of the satiric species but being convinced how barren a soil poetry is and how unlikely to yield a competent provision for its professors he studied physic for the improvement of which he went beyond sea took the degree of dr of that faculty at avignon returned and was incorporated in the university in the latter end of queen elizabeths reign

choose my death suck out my soul with kisses cruel maid in thy breasts crystal balls embalm my breath dole it all out in sighs when i am laid thy lips on mine like cupping glasses clasp let our

tresses stifle me outright like circe change me to a loathsome swine so i may live for ever in thy sight into heavens joys can none profoundly see except that first they meditate on thee   when our author wishes to be changed into a loathsome swine so he might dwell in sight of his mistress he should have considered that however agreeable the metamorphosis might be to him it could not be so to her to look upon such a loathsome object  sir john davies was born at chisgrove in the parish of tysbury in wiltshire being the son of a wealthy tanner of that place at fifteen years of age he became a commoner in queenscollege oxford      where having made preat progress in academical learning and taken the degree of bachelor of arts he removed to the middle temple and applying himself to the study of the common law was called to the bar but having a quarrel with one richard martyn afterward recorder of london he bastinadoed him in the templehall at dinnertime in presence of the whole assembly for which contempt he was immediately expelled and retired again to oxford to prosecute his studies but did not resume the scholars gown upon this occasion he composed that excellent poem called nosce teipsum muses library p      afterward by the favor of thomas lord ellesmere keeper of the great seal being reinstated in the temple he practiced as a counselor and became a burgess in the parliament held at westminster   0  upon the death of queen elizabeth our author with lord hunsdon went into scotland to congratulate king james on his succession to the english throne being introduced into his majestys presence the king enquired of lord hunsdon the names of the gentlemen who accompanied him and when his lordship mentioned john davies the king presently asked whether he was nosce teipsum and being answered he was embraced him and assured him of his favor he was accordingly made solicitor and a little after attorney general in ireland where in the year   0  he was made one of his majestys sergeants at law and speaker of the house of commons for that kingdom in the year following he received the honor of knighthood from the king at whitehall in      he quitted the post of attorney general in ireland and was made one of his majestys english sergeants at law he married eleanor touchet youngest daughter of george lord audley by whom he had a son an idiot who died young and a daughter named lucy married to ferdinand lord hastings and afterward earl of huntingdon his lady was a woman of very extraordinary character she had or rather pretended to have a spirit of prophecy and her predictions received from a voice which she often heard were generally wrapped up in dark and obscure expressions it was commonly reported that on the sunday before her husbands death she was sitting at dinner with him she suddenly burst into tears whereupon he asking her the occasion she answered husband these are your funeral tears to which he replied pray therefore spare your tears now and i will be content that you shall laugh when i am dead after sir johns death she lived privately at parston in hertfordshire and an account was published of her strange and wonderful prophecies in   0   in      sir john was appointed lord chief justice of the kings bench but before the ceremony of his installation could be performed he died suddenly of an apoplexy in the fiftyseventh year of his age and was buried in the church of st martins in the fields he enjoyed the joint applauses of camden ben johnson sir john harrington seldom done and corbet these are great authorities in our authors favor and i may fairly assert that no philosophical writers ever explained their ideas more clearly and familiarl in prose or more harmoniously and beautifully in verse there is a peculiar happiness in his sunilies being introduced more to illustrate than adorn which renders them as useful as entertaining and distinguishes them from any other author  in quality of a lawyer sir john produced the following pieces   a discovery of the true causes why ireland was never entirely subdued until his majestys happy reign printed in  to london      dedicated to the king with this latin verse only principis est virtus maxima nosse suos   a declaration of our sovereign lord the king concerning the title of his majestys son charles the prince and duke of cornwall london        his principal performance as a poet is a poem on the original nature and immortality of the soul dedicated to queen elizabeth it was republished by nahum tate      addressed to the earl of dorset and middlesex who was a great admirer of our poet and the editor gives it a very just and advantageous character without doubt it is the nosce teipsum so much admired by king james printed      and      mentioned by wood to which were added by the same hand  hymns of astrea in acrostic verse and orchestra or a poem expressing the antiquity and excellency of dancing in a dialogue between penelope and one of her woers containing     stanzas unfinished mr wood mentions also epigrams and a translation of several of king davids psalms written by sir john davies but never published  nosce teipsum why did my parents send me to the schools that i with knowledge might enrich my mind since the desire to know first made men fools and did corrupt the root of all mankind for when gods hand had written in the hearts of our first parents all the rules of good so that their skill infused surpassed all arts that ever were before or since the flood and when their reasons eye was sharp and clear and as an eagle can behold the sun could have approached the eternal light as near as the intellectual angels could have done even then to them the spirit of lies suggests that they were blind because they saw not ill and breathed into their incorrupted breasts a curious wish which did corrupt their will thomas goff a gentleman who flourished in the reign of king james i he was born in essex toward the latter end of queen elizabeths reign about the year      in his youth he was sent to westminsterschool and at the age of eighteen he was entered student of christscollege in oxford langbaines lives of the poets      being an industrious scholar says langbaine he arrived to be a good poet a skilful orator and an excellent preacher in the year      he was made bachelor of divinity and preferred to a living in surry called eastclanden there he married a wife who proved as great a plague to him as a shrew could be she was a true xantippe to our ecclesiastical socrates and gave him daily opportunities of putting his patience to the proof and it is believed by some that this domestic scourge shortened his days he was buried at his own parish church at clanden the   th of july      he writ several pieces on different subjects amongst which are reckoned five plays careless shepherdess a tragicomedy acted before the king and queen at salisburycourt with great applause printed in  to      with an alphabetical catalogue of all such plays as ever were to that time published   courageous turk or amurath i a tragedy acted by the students of christchurch in oxford printed in  vo london      for the plot consult knolless history of the turks   orestes a tragedy acted by the students of christschurch in oxford printed in  vo london        raging turk or bajazet ii a tragedy acted by the students in christschurch in oxford printed in  vo london      this play was written with the two foregoing tragedies when the author was master of arts and student of christschurch but not printed till after his decease   selinus emperor of the turks a tragedy printed in  to london      this play in all probability was never exhibited because it is not divided into acts the author calls this the first part and in his conclusion as he styles it or epilogue he promises a second part saying if this first part gentles do like you well the second part shall greater murders tell    the plot is founded on the turkish history in the reign of selinus i  mr philips and mr winstanley have ascribed a comedy to this author called cupids whirligig though democritus and heraclitus were not more different in their temper than his genius was opposite to comedy besides the true author was one mr e s who in his dedicatory epistle says that being long pregnant with desire to bring forth something and being afterward brought to bed had chose his friend mr robert hayman to be godfather not doubting but his child would be well maintained seeing he could not live above an hour with him and therefore he entreated him when he was dead that he might be buried deep enough in his good opinion and that he might deserve this epitaph  here lies the child that was born in mirth  against the strict rules of childbirth  and to be quit i gave him to my friend  who laughed him to death and that was his end   the reason of my making this digression is to show that such ridiculous unmeaning mirth is not likely to have fallen from mr goff as he was a grave man and nothing but what was manly droped from his pen in the latter part of his life he forsook the stage for the pulpit and instead of plays writ sermons some of which appeared in print in the year      to these works may be added his latin funeral oration at the divinity school at the obsequies of sir henry saville printed in  to oxon      another in christschurch cathedral at the funeral of dr goodwin canon of that church printed in london       sir fulk greville lord brook sprung from an honorable family in warwickshire he was educated both at oxford and cambridge and introduced to court by an uncle in the service of queen elizabeth who received him into her favor which he had the happiness to preserve uninterupted to her death at the coronation of james i he was created knight of the bath and soon after obtained a grant of the ruinous castle of warwick he was next appointed subtreasurer chancellor of the exchequer and privy counselor and then advanced to the degree of a baron by the title of lord brook of beauchampscourt and one of the lords of the bedchamber to his majesty this noble author was the friend of sir philip sidney than which a greater compliment cannot be bestowed as he was a poet and a man of wit he was held in the highest esteem in that courtly age but he added to genius a gallantry of spirit and was as fine a soldier as a writer winstanley gives an instance of his prowess in arms at the time says he when the french ambassador came over to england to negotiate a marriage between the duke of anjou and queen elizabeth for the better entertainment of the court solemn justs were proclaimed where the earl of arundel frederick lord windsor sir philip sidney and he were chief challengers against all comers in which challenge he behaved himself so gallantly that he won the reputation of a most valiant knight thus you see that though ease be the nurse of poetry the muses are also companions to mars as may be exemplified in the characters of the earl of surry sir philip sidney and sir fulk greville  as our author loved and admired the ladies it is somewhat extraordinary that he died a bachelor for in all that courtly age he could not find one on whom to confer the valuable prize of his heart as he was himself a learned man and possessed a variety of knowledge so he patronized many necessitous candidates for fame but particularly camden whom he caused by his interest to be made king at arms he wa likewise very liberal to mr speed the celebrated chronloger finding him a man of extensive knowledge and his occupation and circumstances mean so that his genius was depressed by poverty he enabled him to prosecute his studies and pursue the bent of his genius without being obliged to drudge at a manual employment for his bread speed in his description of warwickshire writes thus of lord brook whose merit says he toward me i do acknowledge in setting my hand free from the daily employments of a manual trade and giving it full liberty thus to express the inclination of mind himself being the procurer of my present estate he passed through life in a calm of prosperity and honor beloved by his equals reverenced by his inferiors and a favorite at court but when he was about seventy years of age this life of undisturbed tranquillity was sacrificed to the resentment of a villain and a catastrophe of the most tragical kind closed the days of this worthy man  one haywood who had been many years in his service and had behaved with fidelity and honor expostulated with him freely while they were alone for his not having received a due reward for his services his lordship enraged at his presumption and giving way to his passion reprimanded him very severely for his insolence for which the villain being now wrought up to the highest degree of fury took an opportunity to stab him with his dagger through the back into the vitals of which wound he instantly died september  0       the murderer then struck with remorse horror and despair and all the natural attendants of his guilt retired to his chamber and having secured the door fell upon the same weapon with which he had assassinated his master and anticipated on himself the justice reserved for the hand of an executioner lord brook was interred in warwickshire under a monument of black and white marble fullers worthies of warwickshire p     whereon he is styled servant to queen elizabeth counselor to king james and friend to sir philip sidney  his works are chiefly these viz alaham a tragedy printed in folio      this play says langbaine seems an imitation of the ancients the prologue is spoken by a ghost this spectre gives an account of each character which is perhaps done after the manner of euripides who introduced one of the chief actors as the prologue whose business it was to explain all those circumstances which preceded the opening the stage he has not in one scene throughout introduced above two speakers in compliance with horaces rule in his art of poetry nec quarta loqui persona laboret mr langbaine professes himself ignorant from whence the plot is taken neither can he find the name of any such prince as alaham that reigned in ormus where the scene lies an island situated at the entrance of the persian gulf which is mentioned by mr herbert travels third edition p     in his account of ormus mustapha a tragedy printed in folio      this play likewise seems to be built on the model of the ancients and the plot is the same with that of lord orrerys tragedy of the same title and taken from paulus jovius thuanus etc both these plays are printed together in folio london  0   with several other poems as a treatise on human learning an inquisition upon fame and honor a treatise of wars all these are written in a stanza of six lines four interwoven and a couplt in base which the italians call sestine coelica containing one hundred and nine sonnets of different measures there are in this volume two letters the one to an honorable lady containing directions how to behave in a married state the other addressed to his cousin grevil varney then in france containing directions for traveling his lordship has other pieces ascribed to him besides those published under his name the life of sir philip sidney printed at the beginning of the arcadia his remains or poems of monarchy and religion printed in  vo london    0 philips and winstanley ascribe a play to him called marcus tullius cicero but this is without foundation for that play was not written at least not printed till long after his lordships death having now given some account of his works i shall sum up his character in the words of mrs cooper in her muses library as it is not easy to do it to better advantage  i dont know says she whether a woman may be acquitted for endeavoring to sum up a character so various and important as his lordships but if the attempt can be excused i dont desire to have it pass for a decisive sentence perhaps few men that dealt in poetry had more learning or real wisdom than this nobleman and yet his style is sometimes so dark and mysterious that one would imagine he chose rather to conceal than illustrate his meaning at other times his wit breaks out again with an uncommon brightness and shines i would almost said without an equal it is the same thing with his poetry sometimes so harsh and uncouth as if he had no ear for music at others so smooth and harmonious as if he was master of all its powers the piece from which i shall quote some lines is entitled a treatise of human learning the mind of man is this worlds true dimension and knowledge is the measure of the mind and as the mind in her vast comprehension contains more worlds than all the world can find so knowledge does itself far more extend than all the minds of men can comprehend a climbing height it is without a head depth without bottom way without an end a circle with no line environed not comprehended all it comprehends worth infinite yet satisfies no mind till it that infinite of the godhead find   john day this author lived in the reign of king james i and was some time student in caius college in cambridge no particulars are preserved concerning this poet but that he had connection with other poets of some name and wrote the following plays   blind beggar of bethnal green with the merry humor of tom stroud the norfolk yeoman several times publicly acted by the princes servants printed in  to london      for the plot as far as it concerns history consult the writers in the reign of king henry vi   humor out of breath a comedy said to have been writ by our author but some have doubted his being the real author of it   isle of gulls a comedy often acted in the black friars by the children of the revels printed in  to london      this is founded upon sir philip sidneys arcadia   law tricks or who would have thought it a comedy several times acted by the children of the revels and printed in  to   0    parliament of bees with their proper characters or a beehive furnished with twelve honeycombs as pleasant as profitable being an allegorical description of the ancients of good and bad men in those days printed in  to london        travels of three english brothers sir thomas sir anthony and mr robert shirley a history played by her majestys servants printed in  to london   0  and dedicated to honors favorites and the entire friends of the family of the shirleys in the composition of this play our author was assisted by william rowley and mr george wilkins the foundation of it may be read in several english writers and chronicles and it is particularly set down in dr fullers worthies in his description of sussex when our author died cannot be justly ascertained but mr langbaine has preserved an elegy written on him by his friend mr tateham which begins thus don phoebus now has lost his light and left his rule unto the night and cynthia she has overcome the day and darkened the sun whereby we now have lost our hope of gaining day into horoscope etc   in this manner he runs on like a gentleman in lincolns inn who wrote an ingenious poem upon the transactions between a landlord and his tenant day who privately departed from him by night printed in a single sheet london      to show the parallel the following lines are sufficient how night and day conspire a secret flight for day they say is gone away by night the day is past but landlord where is your rent you might have seen that day was almost spent day sold and did put off whatever he might though it was never so dark day would be light   sir walter raleigh was descended of an ancient family in devonshire which was seated in that county before the conquest princes worthies of devon  and was fourth son of walter raleigh esquire of fards in the parish of cornwood he was born in the year      at hayes a pleasant farm of his fathers in the parish of budley in that part of devonshire bordering eastward upon the sea near where the ottery discharges itself into the british channel he was educated at the university of oxford where according to dr fuller he became a commoner of oriel college as well as christ church and displayed in his early years a great vivacity of genius in his application to his studies some have said that after leaving the university he settled himself in the middle temple and studied the law but this opinion must be erroneous since he declares afterward on his trial that he never read a word of law till he was prisoner in the tower in      when he was not above    years of age he was one of the select troop of a hundred gentlemen volunteers whom queen elizabeth permitted henry champernon to transport into france for the assistance of protestant princes there camdeni annals elizabethae p     edit batav       but of what service they were or what was the consequence of the expedition we have no account so great a scene of action as the whole kingdom of france was at that period gave raleigh an opportunity of acquiring experience and reading characters as well as improving himself in the knowledge of languages and manners and his own history of the world contains some remarks which he then made of the conduct of some great generals there of which he had himself been witness after our authors return from france he embarked in an expedition to the northern parts of america with sir humphry gilbert his brother by the mothers side that gentleman having obtained the queens patent to plant and inhabit such parts of it as were unpossessed by any prince with whom she was in alliance but this attempt proved unsuccessful by means of the division which arose amongst the volunteers the next year    0 upon the descent of the spanish and italian forces in ireland under the popes banner for the support of the desmonds in their rebellion in munster he had a captains commission under the lord gray of wilton to whom at that time the famous spenser was secretary but the chief services which captain raleigh performed were under thomas earl of ormond governor of munster he surprised the irish kerns at ramile and having enclosed them took every rebel upon the spot who did not fall in the conflict among the prisoners there was one laden with withies who being asked what he intended to have done with them boldly answered to have hung up the english churles upon which raleigh ordered him to be immediately dispatched in that manner and the rest of the robbers and murderers to be punished according to their deserts hoolter fol      the earl of ormond departing for england in the spring of the year      his government of munster was given to captain raleigh in which he behaved with great vigilance and honor he fought the arch rebel barry at clove whom he charged with the utmost bravery and after a hard struggle put to flight in the month of august      captain john gouch being appointed governor of munster by the lord deputy raleigh attended him in several journies to settle and compose that country but the chief place of their residence was cork and after gouch had cut off sir john desmond brother to the earl of desmond who was at the head of the rebellion he left the government of that city to raleigh cases history of ireland fol      whose company being not long after disbanded upon the reduction of that earl the slaughter of his brother and the submission of barry he returned to england the lord deputy gray having resigned the sword in ireland toward the end of august      the dispute between him and raleigh upon reasons which are variously assigned by different writers was brought to a hearing before the council table in england where the latter supported his cause with such abilities as procured him the good opinion both of her majesty and the lords of the council and this added to the patronage of the earl of leicester is supposed to be one considerable occasion of his preferment though it did not immediately take place nor could the hopes of it restrain him from a second expedition with his brother sir humphry gilbert to newfoundland for which he built a ship of  00 tons called the bark raleigh and furnished it completely for the voyage in which he resolved to attend his brother as his vice admiral that fleet departed from plymouth the   th of june      but after it had been two or three days at sea a contagious distemper having seized the whole crew of raleighs ship obliged him to return to that port however by this accident he escaped the misfortune of that expedition for after sir humphry had taken possession of newfoundland in the right of the crown of england and assigned lands to every man of his company and sailed three hundred leagues in the voyage home with full hopes of the queens assistance to fit out a fleet next year he unfortunately perished for venturing rashly in a frigate of but ten tons he was on the ninth of september that year at midnight swallowed up in an high sea another vessel suffered the same fate and even the rest returned not without great hazard and loss captain hayness report of sir humphry gilberts voyage to newfoundland vol iii p      but this ill success could not divert raleigh from pursuing a scheme of such importance to his country as those discoveries in north america he drew up an account of the advantage of such a design and the means of prosecuting it which he laid before the queen and council who were so well satisfied with the probability of success that on the   th of march      her majesty granted him letters patent in favor of his project containing free liberty to discover such remote heathen and barbarous lands as were not actually possessed by any chistian prince nor inhabited by christian people immediately upon this grant raleigh chose two able and experienced captains and furnished them with two vessels fitted out at his own expense with such expedition that on the   th of april following they set sail for the west of england taking their course by the canary islands where they arrived on the  0th of may toward the west indies and that being in those days the best and most frequented rout to america they passed by the carribbe islands in the beginning of june and reached the gulf of florida on the  d of july sailing along the shore about one hundred and twenty miles before they could find a convenient harbor at last they debarked in a very low land which proved to be an island called wohoken and after taking formal possession of the country they carried on a friendly correspondence with the native indians who supplied them with a great variety of fish and venison and gave them furs and deerskins in exchange for trifles thus encouraged by the natives eight of the company in a boat went up the river occam twenty miles and next day in the evening they came to an island called roanah which was but seven leagues from the place where their ships lay here they found the residence of the indian chief whose name was grangamineo whose house consisted of nine apartments built of cedar fortified round with sharp pieces of timber his wife came out to them and ordered the people to carry them from the boat on their backs and showed them many other civilities they continued their intercourse with the natives for some time still viewing the situation of the adjacent country and after having obtained the best information they could of the number and strength of the indian nations in that neighborhood and of their connexions alliances or contests with each other they returned about the middle of september to england and made such an advantageous report of the fertility of the soil and healthiness of the climate that the queen favored the design of settling a colony in that country to which she was pleased to give the name of virginia oldys fol       about two months after raleigh was chosen knight of the shire for his county of devon and made a considerable figure in parliament where a bill passed in confirmation of his patent for the discovery of foreign countries during the course of this sessions he received the honor of knighthood from her majesty a distinction the more honorable to him as the queen was extremely cautious in confering titles and besides the patent for discoveries she granted him about the same time a power to license the vending of wines throughout the kingdom which was in all probability very lucrative to him but it engaged him in a dispute with the university of cambridge which had opposed one keymer whom he had licensed to sell wine there contrary to the privileges of that university  the parliament being prorogued raleigh intent upon planting his new colony in virginia set out his own fleet of seven sail for that country under the command of his cousin sir richard greenville who after having visited the country left behind him an hundred and seven persons to settle a colony at roanah in his return to england he took a spanish prize worth  0000l but this was not the only circumstance of good fortune which happened to raleigh this year for the rebellion in ireland being now suppressed and the forfeited lands divided into signiories among those principally who had been instrumental in the important service of reducing that country her majesty granted him one of the largest portions consisting of twelve thousand acres in the counties of cork and waterford with certain privileges and immunities upon condition of planting and improving the same to which the other grantees were obliged  in the year      we find our author so highly advanced in the queens favor so extremely popular on account of his patronage of learned men and the active spirit he exerted in business that her majesty made him seneschal in the duchy of cornwall but these distinctions incurred the usual effects of court preferment and exposed sir walter to the envy of those who were much inferior to him in merit and even the earl of leicester himself who had formerly been his great patron became jealous of him and set up in opposition to him his nephew the young earl of essex the comedians likewise took the liberty to reflect upon raleighs power and influence upon the queen which her majesty resented so highly as to forbid tarleton the most celebrated actor of that age from approaching her presence  raleigh sollicitous for the prosperity of the plantation in virginia sent out new supplies from time to time some of whom were obliged to return home and the general alarm spread over the nation on account of the spanish invasion threw all things into disorder  about the beginning of the year      he was raised to the dignity of captain of her majestys guard which he held together with the place of lordwarden of the stannaries and lieutenant general of the county of cornwall from this time till the year      we find sir walter continually engaged in projecting new expeditions sending succors to colonies abroad or managing affairs in parliament with consummate address  in the year      we find father parsons the jesuit charging him with no less a crime than atheism and that he had founded a school in which he taught atheistical principles and had made a great many young gentlemen converts to them the most considerable authority to countenance the suspicions of sir walters religion is that of archbishop abbot who in a letter dated at lambeth addressed to sir thomas roe then an ambassador at the moguls court expressly charges sir walter with doubting gods being and omnipotence birchs lise of raleigh  but it is highly probable sir walters opinions might be misrepresented by his enemies or wrong conclusions drawn from those which he maintained and it would be a shocking injustice to the memory of so great a man to suspect him of irreligion whose writings contain not the least trace of it and whose history of the world in particular breathes a strong spirit of real and genuine piety  in the height of his favor with the queen he fell under her majestys displeasure for being enamoured of mrs elizabeth throgmorton one of the queens maids of honor whom he debauched and such it seems was the chastity of these times that a frailty of that sort was looked upon as the highest offense her majesty was so exasperated that she commanded him to be confined several months and after his enlargement forbid him the court whence the poor lady was likewise dismissed from her attendance about the maiden queen who appeared in this case the champion of virginity sir walter soon made her an honorable reparation by marriage and they were both examples of conjugal affection and fidelity during the time our author continued under her majestys displeasure for this offense he projected the discovery of the rich and extensive empire of guiana in the south of america which the spaniards had then visited and to that day had never conquered for this purpose having collected informations relating to it he sent an old officer to take a view of the coast who returned the year following with a very favorable account of the riches of the country which he had received from some of the principal cassiques upon the borders of it this determined raleighs resolution who provided a squadron of ships at a very great expense and the lord high admiral howard and sir robert cecil conceived so good an opinion of the design that both concurred in it he personally engaged in the attempt and with no great number of ships so far explored the unknown country that he made greater progress in a few months than the spaniards had done for many years and having satisfied himself of the certainty of the gold mines of the country he returned home with honor and riches the latter end of the summer      and in the year following published in quarto an account of the voyage and discoveries dedicated to lord admiral howard and sir robert cecil  the next year sir walter was so far restored to the queens favor that he was engaged in the important and successful expedition to adiz in which the earl of essex and lord admiral howard were joint commanders and raleigh of the council of war and one of the admirals in this as in all his other expeditions he behaved with equal conduct and courage after his return from the successful expedition under the earl of essex he promoted a reconciliation between that nobleman and secretary cecil in consequence of which he was himself fully reinstated in the queens savor and had the command of captain of the guard restored to him with other marks of her forgiveness  in      he was employed in the island voyage as rear admiral the earl of essex having the chief command and the lord thomas howard the post of vice admiral the design of it was to defeat and destroy at ferol as well as in the other ports of the enemy the spanish flee intended for a new expedition against england and ireland and to seize upon such indian fleets of treasure as they should meet with belonging to the king of spain to conquer restrain and garrison most of the isles of the azores and especially the terceras but the success of this expedition did not anwer the greatness of the preparations for it the jealousy of the earl of essex the commander obstructing the services which sir walters abilities might otherwise have performed in the council of war which was held before the isle of flores it was resolved that the general and sir walter should jointly attack the island of fyal where the latter waited seven days for his lordship and hearing nothing of him called a council of war in which it was determined that raleigh should attempt the town himself which he did with astonishing bravery and success essex finding himself deprived of the honor of taking fyal was exasperated to such a degree that he broke some of the officers who had behaved with great gallantry under raleigh and some of his sycophants alleged that raleigh himself deserved to lose his head for breach of articles in landing without his lordships orders upon their return to england the earl endeavored to transfer the miscarriages of the expedition upon raleigh and gained to his side the populace whom sir walter never courted and whose patronage he scorned but the queen herself was not well pleased with the earls conduct since it was judged he might have done more than he did and his proceedings against sir walter in calling his actions to public question were highly disapproved letter of rowland white esquire to sir robert sidney november          the next important transaction we find raleigh engaged in was in   0  when the unfortunate earl of essex who had calumniated him to the king of scotland and endeavored all he could to shake his interest was so ill advised by his creatures as to attempt a public insurrection raleigh was active in suppressing it the earl pretended that the cause of his taking arms was to defend himself against the violence of his personal enemies the lord cobham and raleigh having formed a design of murdering him though on the other hand it is pretty certain that sir ferdinand gorges one of the earls accomplices afterward accused sir christopher blount another of them for persuading him to kill or at least apprehend sir walter which gorges refusing blount discharged four shots after him in a boat blount acknowledged this and at the time of his execution asked sir walter forgiveness for it which he readily granted  while the earl garisoned his house sir walter was one of those who invested it and when his lordship was brought to his trial he with forty of the queens guard was present upon duty and was likewise examined with relation to a conference which he had upon the thames the morning of the insurrection with sir ferdinando gorges at the execution of essex six days after in the tower raleigh attended probably in his character of captain of the guard and stood near the scaffold that he might the better answer if essex should be desirous of speaking to him but retired before the earls execution because the people seemed to take his appearance there in a wrong light though he afterward repented of it as the earl expressed an inclination to see and speak with him before his death which was in all probability to have asked raleighs forgiveness for having traduced and calumniated him in order to color his own rash designs  in   0  our author sold his estate in ireland to mr boil afterward earl of cork and about midsummer he settled his estate of sherbone on his son walter on account of a challenge which he had received from sir amias preston who had been knighted at cadiz by the earl of essex which challenge sir walter intended to accept and therefore disposed his affairs in proper order the cause of their quarrel does not appear but they were afterward reconciled without proceeding to a duel oldys sol       the death of queen elizabeth on the   th of march   0   proved a great misfortune to raleigh james her successor having been prejudiced against him by the earl of essex who insinuated that raleigh was no friend to his succession nor had any regard for his family and these prejudices were heightened by secretary cecil in his private correspondence with that pusilanimous jealous prince before he ascended the throne of england or at least immediately upon that event for though raleigh and cecil had united against essex yet after the ruin of that earl and his party their seeming friendship terminated in a mutual struggle for a superiority of power but there is another important cause of jamess disgust to sir walter which is that he lord cobham and sir john fortescue would have obliged the king to articles before he was admitted to the throne and that the number of his countrymen should be limited which added to the circumstance of sir walters zeal to take off his mother inspired his majesty with a confirmed aversion to him and indeed the tragical end of the queen of scots is perhaps the greatest error with which the annals of that glorious reign is stained raleigh in vain endeavored to gain the affection of the new king which he attempted by transfering on secretary cecil the blood of the earl of essex as well as that of his royal mother but this attempt to secure the affections of a weak prince ended in his ruin for it exasperated cecil the more against him and as sir walter was of an active martial genius the king who was a lover of peace and a natural coward was afraid that so military a man would involve him in a war which he hated above all things in the world our author was soon removed from his command as captain of the guard which was bestowed upon sir thomas erskin his majestys favorite as well as countryman oldys fol      the predecessor to the earl of mar whose actions performed in the year      are recent in every ones memory  not long after his majestys ascending the throne of england sir walter was charged with a plot against the king and royal family but no clear evidence was ever produced that raleigh had any concern in it the plot was to have surprised the king and court to have created commotions in scotland animated the discontented in england and advanced arabella stuart cousin to the king to the throne arabella was the daughter of lord charles stuart younger brother to henry lord darnly and son to the duke of lenox she was afterward married to william seymour son to lord beauchamp and grandson to the earl of hertford and both were confined for the presumption of marrying without his majestys consent from which they made their escape but were again retaken lady arabella died of grief and mr seymour lived to be a great favorite with charles i raleigh persisted in avowing his ignorance of the plot and when he came to his trial he behaved himself so prudently and defended himself with so much force that the minds of the people present who were at first exasperated against him were turned from the severest hatred to the tenderest pity notwithstanding sir walters proof that he was innocent of any such plot and that lord cobham who had once accused him had recanted and signed his recantation nor was produced against him face to face a packed jury brought him in guilty of high treason sentence of death being pronounced against him he humbly requested that the king might be made acquainted with the proofs upon which he was cast he accompanied the sheriff to prison with wonderful magnanimity though in a manner suited to his unhappy situation raleigh was kept near a month at winchester in daily expectation of death and in a very pathetic letter wrote his last words to his wife the night before he expected to suffer raleighs remains vol ii p      in which he hoped his blood would quench their malice who had murdered him and prayed god to forgive his persecutors and accusers the king signed the warrant for the execution of the lords cobham and gray and sir griffin markham at winchester pretending says lord cecil to forbear sir walter for the present till lord cobhams death had given some light how far he would make good his accusation markham was first brought upon the scaffold and when he was on his knees ready to receive the blow of the ax the groom of the bedchamber produced to the sheriff his majestys warrant to stop the execution and markham was told that he must withdraw a while into the hall to be confronted by the lords then lord gray was brought forth and having poured out his prayers and confession was likewise called aside and lastly lord cobham was exposed in the same manner and performed his devotions though we do not find that he said one word of his guilt or innocence or charged raleigh with having instigated him all which circumstances seem more than sufficient to wipe off from the memory of raleigh the least suspicion of any plot against jamess person or government  he was remanded to the tower of london with the rest of the prisoners of whom markham afterward obtained his liberty and traveled abroad lord gray of wilton died in the tower lord cobham was consined there many years during which it is said he was examined by the king in relation to raleigh and entirely cleared him he afterward died in the lowest circumstances of distress  in february following a grant was made by the king of all the goods and chattels forfeited by sir walters conviction to the trustees of his appointing for the benefit of his creditors lady and children after    years confinement in the tower in march      he was released out of it by the interposition of the favorite buckingham but before he quitted that place he saw the earl of somerset committed there for the murder of sir thomas overbury and afterward condemned which occasioned sir walter to compare his own case with that of the carls and to remark that the whole history of the world had not the like precedent of a kings prisoner to purchase freedom and his bosom favorite to have the halter but in scripture in the case of mordecai and haman on hearing which the king is said to have replied that raleigh might die in that deceit which afterward proved true for the king pardoned the infamous somerset a murderer and executed raleigh a brave and an honest man equally to the astonishment of the world sir walter being now at large had the means of prosecuting his old scheme of settling guiana which he had so much at heart that even during his imprisonment he held a constant correspondence with that country sending thither every year or every second year a ship to keep the indians in hopes of being relieved from the tyranny of the spaniards who had again encroached upon them and massacred many both of the inhabitants and of raleighs men in these ships were brought several natives of the country with whom he conversed in the tower and obtained all possible informations concerning it upon such informations he offered his scheme for prosecuting his discovery to the court before he undertook it in person nor were there any doubts either as to the improbability of the design or its unlawfulness notwithstanding the peace made with spain otherwise the king would not have made such grants as he did even at that time which shows that he was then convinced that sir walter had in his first voyage discovered and taken possession of that country for the crown of england and consequently that his subjects were justly entitled to any benefits that might arise from its discovery without the least respect to the pretensions of the spaniards besides when sir walter first moved the court upon this subject the spanish match was not thought of and the kings necessities being then very pressing he may be presumed to have conceived great hopes from that discovery though he might afterward change his opinion when he grew so unreasonably fond of that match  in      he obtained a royal commission to settle guiana at the expense of himself and his friends he was appointed general and commander in chief of this enterprise and governor of the new country which he was to settle with ample authority a power was granted him too of exercising martial law in such a manner as the kings lieutenant general by sea or land or any lieutenants of the counties of england had these powers seem to imply a virtual pardon to raleigh and perhaps made him less solicitous for an actual one meantime gondemar the spanish ambassador by his address vivacity and flattering the humors of james had gained a great ascendency over him and began to make a great clamor about raleighs preparations and from that moment formed schemes of destroying him the whole expense of this expedition was defrayed by raleigh and his friends the fleet consisted of about seven sail on the   th of november      they came in sight of guiana and soon after to anchor in five degrees off the river caliana where they remained till the  th of december raleigh was received with great joy by the indians who not only assisted him with provisions and every thing else in their power but offered him the sovereignty of their country if he would settle amongst them which he declined to accept letter to his lady from caliana november          his extreme sickness for six weeks prevented him from undertaking the discovery of the mines in person and was obliged to depute captain keymis to that service and accordingly on the  th of december ordered five small ships to sail into the river oronoque when they landed they found a spanish garrison between them and the mine which sallying out unexpectedly put them in confusion and gave them lattle in this conflict young raleigh was killed and by a fatal mistake captain keymis did not prove the mine but burnt and plundered the spanish garrison and found amongst the governors papers one which informed him that raleighs expedition had been betrayed and that he was to be sacrificed to the spaniards upon keymiss unsuccessful attempt raleigh sharply rebuked him for his mistake and a deviation from his orders which so much affected that captan that he shot himself in his own cabin and finding the wound not mortal he finished his design by a long knife with which he stabbed himself to the heart in this distressful situation raleigh returned home and found on his arrival at plymouth a declaration published against him at which he took the alarm and contrived to convey himself out of the kingdom in a vessel hired for that purpose by an old officer of his but changing his opinion in that respect he proceeded in his journey to london  yet thinking it proper to gain time for the appeasing his majesty by the assistance of one manuric a french quack he counterfeited sickness for several days during which he wrote his apology however on the  th of august he arrived at london where he was consined in his own house but having still good reasons not to trust himself to the mercy of the court he formed a design to escape into france which sir lewis stackley who was privy to and encouraged it discovered and sir walter being seized in a beat upon the river below woolwich was a second time on the  0th of august committed to the tower but though his death seemed absolutely determined yet it semed difficult to find a method of accomplishing it since his conduct in the late expedition could not be strtched in law to such a sentence it was resolved therefore to sacrifice him to the resentment of spain in a manner so shameful that it has justly exposed the conduct of the court to the indignation of all succeeding ages and transmitted the pusillanimous monarch with infamy to posterity they called him down to judgment upon his former sentence passed fifteen years before which they were not then ashamed to execute a privy seal was sent to the judges to order immediate execution on which a conference was held friday the   th of oct      between all the judges of england concerning the manner how prisoners who have been attainted of treason and set at liberty should be brought to execution in consequence of their resolution a privy seal came to the kings bench commanding that court to proceed against sir walter according to law who next day received notice of the council to prepare himself for death and on wednesday the   th of that month at   oclock in the morning was taken out of bed in the hot fit of an ague and carried to the kings bench westminster where execution was awarded against him the next morning the   th of october the day of the lordmayors inauguration a solemnity never perhaps attended before with a public execution sir walter was conducted by the sheriffs of middlesex to the old palace yard in westminster where mounting the scaffold he behaved with the most undaunted spirit and seeming cheerfulness the bishop of salisbury tohon being surprised at the heros contempt of death and expostulating with him upon it he told him plainly that he never feared death and much less then for which he blessed god and as to the manner of it though to others it might seem grievous yet for himself he had rather die so than in a burning fever this verifies the noble observation of shakespeare that all heroes have a contempt of death which he puts in the mouth of julius caesar when his friends dissuaded him from going to the senate house cowards die many a time before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonders i have heard of yet it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death the necessary end will come when it will come    sir walter eat his breakfast that morning smoaked his pipe and made no more of death than if he had been to take a journey on the scaffold he conversed freely with the earl of arundel and others of the nobility and vindicated himself from two suspicions the first of entering into a confederacy with france the second of speaking disloyally of his majesty he cleared himself likewise of the suspicion of having persecuted the earl of essex or of insulting him at his death he concluded with desiring the good people to join with him in prayer to that great god of heaven whom says he i have grievously offended being a man full of vanity who has lived a sinful life in such callings as have been most inducing to it for i have been a soldier a sailor and a courtier which are courses of wickedness and vice the proclamation being made that all men should depart the scaffold he prepared himself for death gave away his hat and cap and money to some attendants that stood near him when he took leave of the lords and other gentlemen that stood near him he entreated the lord arundel to prevail with the king that no scandalous writings to defame him should be published after his death concluding i have a long journey to go and therefore will take my leave then having put off his gown and doublet he called to the executioner to show him the axe which not being presently done he said i pray thee let me see it dont thou think i am afraid of it and having it in his hands he felt along the edge of it and smiling said to the sheriff this is a sharp medicine but it is a physician for all diseases the executioner kneeling down and asking him forgiveness sir walter laying his hand upon his shoulder granted it and being asked which way he would lay himself on the block he answered so the heart be right it is no matter which way the head lies his head was struck off at two blows his body never shrinking nor moving his head was shown on each side of the scaffold and then put into a red leather bag and with his velvet nightgown thrown over was afterward conveyed away in a mourning coach of his ladys his body was interred in the chancel of st margarets church westminster but his head was long preserved in a case by his widow who survived him twentyyears  thus fell sir walter raleigh in the   th year of his age a sacrifice to a contemptible administration and the resentment of a mean prince a man of so great abilities that neither that nor the preceding reign produced his equal his character was a combination of almost every eminent quality he was the soldier statesmen and scholar united and had he lived with the heroes of antiquity he would have made a just parallel to caesar and xenophon like them being equal master of the sword and the pen one circumstance must not be omitted which in a life so full of action as his is somewhat extraordinary viz that whether he was on board his ships upon important and arduous expeditions busy in court transactions or pursuing schemes of pleasure he never failed to dedicate at least four hours every day to study by which he became so much master of all knowledge and was enabled as a poet beautifully expresses it to enrich the world with his prisonhours thompson  as the sentence of raleigh blackens but his king so his memory will be ever dear to the lovers of learning and of their country and though he makes not a very great figure as a poet having business of greater importance continually upon his hands yet it would have been an unpardonable negligence to omit him as he does honor to the list and deserves all the encomiums an honest mind can give or the most masterly pen bestow and it were to be wished some man of eminent talents whose genius is turned to biography of such at present we are not destitute would undertake the life of this hero and by mixing pleasing and natural reflections with the incidents as they occur not a little instruct and delight his countrymen as raleighs life is the amplest field for such an attempt to succeed in  his works are orders to be observed by the commanders of the fleets and land companies under the

i saw the fairy queen at whose approach the soul of petrarche wept and from henceforth those graces were not scene for they this queen attended in whose steed oblivion laid him down in lauras hearse hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed and groans of buried ghosts the heavens did perse where homers spright did tremble all for grief and cursed the access of that celestial thief   but the most extraordinary work of sir walters is his history of the world composed in the tower it has never been without its admirers and i shall close the account of our authors works by the observation of the ingenious author of the rambler upon this history in a paper in which he treats of english historians no      raleigh says he is deservedly celebratd for the labor of his researches and the elegance of his style but he has endeavored to exert his judgment more than his genius to select facts rather than adorn them he has produced a historical dissertation but has seldom risen to the majesty of history  dr john done an eminent poet and divine of the last century was born in london in the year      his father was a merchant descended from a very ancient family in wales and his mother from sir thomas more chancellor of england he was educated in his fathers house under a tutor till the   th year of his age waltons life of done when he was sent to oxford at which time it was observed of him as of the famous pica mirandula that he was rather born wise than made so by study he was admitted commoner of harthall together with his younger brother in michaelmas term      wood vol   col      by advice of his relations who were roman catholics he declined taking the oath tendered upon the occasion of taking degrees after he had studied three years at the university he removed to cambridge and from thence three years after to lincolns end about this time his father died and left him a portion of  000 l he became soon distinguished at lincolns end by his rapid progress in the law he was now eighteen years of age and as yet had attached himself to no particular denomination of christians and as his relations were bigoted to the romish faith he was induced to examine the controversy and to embrace publicly that which appeared to him to be best supported by the authority of the scriptures he relinquished the study of the law and devoted himself entirely to that of the controverted points between the protestants and catholics which ended in a thorough conviction of the truths of the reformed religion  in the years      and      mr done attended the earl of essex in his expeditions against cadiz and the azoresislands and stayed some years in italy and spain and soon after his return to england he was made secretary to lord chancellor egerton this probably was intended by his lordship only as an introduction to a more dignified place for he frequently expressed a high opinion of his secretarys abilities and when he afterward by the solicitation of his lady parted with him he observed that he was fitter to be a secretary to a monarch than to him when he was in the lord chancellors family he married privately without the consent of her father the daughter of sir george more chancellor of the garter and lord lieutenant of the tower who so much resented his daughters marriage without his consent that he procured our authors dismission from the chancellors service and got him committed to prison sir georges daughter lived in the lord chancellors family and was niece to his lady  upon sir georges hearing that his daughter had engaged her heart to done he removed her to his own house in surry and friends on both sides endeavored to weaken their affection for each other but without success for having exchanged the most sacred promises they found means to consummate a private marriage our author was not long in obtaining his liberty but was obliged to be at the expense of a tedious lawsuit to recover the possession of his wife who was forcibly detained from him at length our poets extraordinary merit and winning behavior so far subdued sir georges resentment that he used his interest with the chancellor to have his soninlaw restored to his place but this request was refused his lordship observing that he did not choose to discharge and readmit servants at the request of his passionate petitioners sir george had been so far reconciled to his daughter and son as not to deny his paternal blessing but would contribute nothing toward their support mr donnes fortune being greatly diminished by the expense of travels lawsuits and the generosity of his temper however his wants were in a great measure prevented by the seasonable bounty of their kinsman sir francis wooley who entertained them seveal years at his house at pilford in surry where our author had several children born to him during his residence at pilford he applied himself with great diligence and success to the study of the civil and canon law and was about this time solicited by dr morton afterward lord bishop of durham to go into holy orders and accept of a benefice the doctor would have resigned to him but he thought proper to refuse this obliging offer he lived with sir francis till that gentlemans death by whose mediation a perfect reconciliation was effected between mr done and his fatherinlaw who obliged himself to pay our author  00 l at a certain day as his wifes portion or  0 l quarterly for their maintenance till it was all paid  he was incorporated master of arts in the university of oxford having before taken the same degree at cambridge    0  about two years after the reconciliation with his father he was prevailed upon with much difficulty to accompany sir robert drury to paris walton p     mrs done being then big with child and in a languishing state of health strongly opposed his departure telling him that her divining soul boaded some ill in his absence but sir roberts importunity was not to be resisted and he at last consented to go with him mr walton gives an account of a vision mr done had seen after their arrival there which he says was told him by a person of honor who had a great intimacy with mr done and as it has in it something curious enough i shall here present it to the reader in that authors own words life ubi supra p     two days after their arrival there mr done was left alone in that room in which sir robert and he and some other friends had dined together to this place sir robert returned within half an hour and as he left so he found mr done alone but in such an ecstasy and so altered as to his looks as amazed sir robert to behold him insomuch that he earnestly desired mr done to declare what had befallen him in the short time of his absence to which he was not able to make a present answer but after a long and perplexed pause did at last say i have seen a dreadful vision since i saw you i have seen my wife pass twice by me through this room with her hair hanging about her shoulders and a dead child in her arms to which sir robert replied sure sir you have slept since you saw me and this is the result of some melancholy dream which i desire you to forget for you are now awake to which mr donnes reply was i cannot be surer that i now live than that i have not slept since i saw you and am as sure that at her second appearing she stopped and looked me in the face and vanished rest and sleep had not altered mr donnes opinion next day for then he confirmed his vision with so deliberate a confidence that he inclined sir robert to a faint belief that the vision was true it is an observation that desire and doubt have no rest for he immediately sent a servant to druryhouse with a charge to hasten back and bring him word whether mrs done was dead or alive and if alive in what condition she was as to her health the twelsth day the messenger returned with this account that he found and left mrs done very sad and sick in her bed and that after a long and dangerous labor she had been delivered of a dead child and upon examination the birth proved to be on the same day and about the very hour mr done affirmed he saw her pass by him in his chamber  after donnes return from france many of the nobility pressed the king to confer some secular employment upon him but his majesty who considered him as better qualified for the service of the church than the state rejected their requests though the earl of somerset then the great favorite joined in petitioning for his preferment about this time the disputes concerning the oaths of allegiance and supremacy being gitated mr done by his majestys special command wrote a treatie on that subject entitled pseudo martyr printed in  to    0 with which his his majesty was highly pleased and being firmly resolved to promote him in the church he pressed him to enter into holy orders but he being resolved to qualify himself the better for the sacred office by studying divinity and the learned languages deferred his entering upon it three years longer during which time he made a vigorous application to these branches of knowledge and was then ordained both deacon and priest by dr john king then bishop of london presently after he was appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to his majesty and about the same time attending the king in a progress he was created dr in divinity by the university of cambridge by the particular recommendation of that prince walton p        his abilities and industry in his profession were so eminent and himself so well beloved that within the first year of his entering into holy orders he had the offer of fourteen benefices from persons of quality but as they lay in the country his inclination of living in london made him refuse them all upon his return from cambridge his wife died and his grief for her loss was so great that for some time he betook himself to a retired and solitary life mrs done died in the year      on the seventh day after the birth of her twelfth child she left our author in a narrow unsettled state with seven children then living to her he gave a voluntary assurance that he would never bring them under the subjection of a stepmother and this promise he faithfully kept soon after the death of his wife he was chosen preacher of lincolns inn and in the year      appointed by king james to attend the earl of doncaster in his embassy to the princes of germany and about    months after his return to england he was advanced to the deanery of st pauls upon the vacancy of the deanery the king sent an order to dr done to attend him the next day at dinner when his majesty sat down he said dr done i have invited you to dinner and though you sit not down with me yet i will carve to you of a dish that i know you love well for knowing you love london i do therefore make you dean of st pauls and when i have dined then do you take your beloved dish home to your study say grace there to your self and much good may it do you walton ut supra p     soon after another vicarage of st dunstan in the west and another benefice fell to dr done till the   th year of his age he continued in perfect health when being with his eldest daughter in essex in    0 he was taken ill of a fever which brought on a consumption notwithstanding which he returned to london and preached in his turn at court as usual on the first friday in lent he died on the   st day of march      and was buried in the cathedral church of st pauls where a monument wa erected over him walton says that amongst other preparations for death he made use of this very remarkable one he ordered an urn to be cut in wood on which was to be placed a board of the exact height of his body this being done he caused himself to be tied up in a winding sheet in the same manner that dead bodies are being thus shrouded and standing with his eyes shut and with just so much of the sheet put aside as might discover his thin pale and death like face he caused a skilful painter to draw his picture this piece being finished was placed near his bedside and there remained as his constant remembrancer to the hour of his death  his character as a preacher and a poet are sufficiently seen in his incomparable writings his personal qualifications were as eminent as those of his mind he was by nature exceeding passionate but was apt to be sorry for the excesses of it and like most other passionate men was humane and benevolent his monument was composed of white marble and carved from the picture just now mentioned of him by order of his executor dr king bishop of chichester who wrote the following inscription johannes done s t p  our authors poems consist of   songs and sonnets   epigrams   elegies   epithalamiums or marriage songs

which i run and do run still though still i do deplore when thou have done thou have not done for i have more will thou forgive that sin which i have won others to sin and made my sin their door will thou forgive that sin which i did shun a year or two but wallowed in a score when thou have done thou have not done for i have more i have a sin of fear when i have spun my last thread i shall perish on the shore but swear that at my death thy son shall shine as he shines now and heretofore and having done that thou have done i ask no more   michael drayton a renowned poet who lived in the reigns of elizabeth james and charles i sprung from an ancient family originally descended from the town of drayton in leicestershire burtons description of leicestershire p       but his parents removing into warwickshire he was born there as he himself declares in his polyolbion song    a little village called harsul in that county claims the honor of his birth by which accident it is raised from obscurity he was born in the year      according to the most accurate computation that can be made from the dates of his works when he was but very young he gave such discoveries of a rising genius as rendered him a favorite with his tutors and procured him the patronage of persons of distinction in the year      being then but about ten years of age he was page to some honorable person as may be collected from his own words in some of his epistles to henry reynold esquire it appears that even then he could construe his cato and some other little collections of sentences which made him very anxious to know what sort of beings the poets were and very pressing upon his tutor to make him if possible a poet in consequence of this he was put to the reading of virgils clogues and till even then says one of his biographers he scorned any thing that looked like a ballad though written by elderton himself this elderton was a famous comedian in those days and a facetious companion who having a great readiness at rhiming composed many catches on love and wine which were then in great vogue among the giddy and volatile part of the town but he was not more celebrated for drollory than drinking so that he obtained the name of the bacchanalian buffoon the rednosed balladmaker etc and at last by the excessive indulgence of his favorite vice he fell a martyr to it      and mr camden has preserved this epitaph on him which for its humor i shall here give a place dead drunk here elderton does lie dead as he is he still is dry so of him it may well be said here he but not his thirst is laid   if after this our author did not finish his education at the university of cambridge it is evident from the testimony of sir aston cohain his intimate friend who mentions him in his choice poems of several sorts that he was for some time a student at oxford however he is not taken notice of by wood who has commemorated the most part of the writers who were educated there in      itappears from his poem entitled moses his birth and miracles that he was a spectator at dover of the spanish invasion which was arrogantly styled invincible and it is not improbable that he was engaged in some military employment there especially as we sind some mention made of him as being in esteem with the gentlemen of the army he early addicted himself to the amusement of poetry but all who have written of him have been negligent in informing us how soon he favored the public with any production of his own he was distinguished as a poet about nine or ten years before the death of queen elizabeth but at what time he began to publish cannot be ascertained in the year      when he was but  0 years of age he published a collection of his pastorals likewise some of the most grave poems and such as have transmitted his name to posterity with honor not long after saw the light his barons wars and englands heroical epistles his downfals of robert of normandy matilda and gaveston for which last he is called by one of his cotemporaries tragaediographus and part of his polyobion were written before the year      for all which joined with his personal good character he was highly celebrated at that time not only for the elegance and sweetness of his expressions but his actions and manners which were uniformly virtuous and honorable he was thus characterised not only by the poets and florid writers of those days but also by divines historians and other scholars of the most serious turn and extensive learning in his younger years he was much beloved and patronized by sir walter aston of tixhall in staffordshire to whom for his kind protection he gratefully dedicates many of his poems whereof his barons wars was the first in the spring of his acquaintance as drayton himself expresses it but however it may be gathered from his works that his most early dependence was upon another patron namel sir henry goodere of polesworth in his own county to whom he has been grateful for a great part of his education and by whom he was recommended to the patronage of the countess of bedford it is no less plain from many of his dedications to sir walter aston that he was for many years supported by him and accommodated with such supplies as afforded him leisure to finish some of his most elaborate compositions and the author of the biographia britannicahas told us that it has been alleged that he was by the interest of the same gentleman with sir roger ashton one of the bedchamber to king james in his minority made in some measure ministerial to an intercourse of correspondence between the young king of scots and queen elizabeth but as no authority is produced to prove this it is probably without foundation as poets have seldom inclination activity or steadiness to manage any state affairs particularly a point of so delicate a nature  our author certainly had fair prospects from his services or other testimonies of early attachment to the kings interest of some preferment besides he had written sonnets in praise of the king as a poet thus we see drayton descending to servile flattery to promote his interest and praising a man as a poet contrary to his own judgment because he was a king who was as devoid of poetry as courage  he welcomed his majesty to his british dominions with a congratulatory poem printed in  to   0   the same year he was chosen by sir walter aston one of the esquires who attended him when he was with others created knight of the bath at the coronation of his majesty it no where appears that ever our author printed those poems in praise of his majesty and the ungrateful reception they met as well as the disagreeable experience of the universal degeneracy at court so different from that of the maiden reign might extinguish all hope of raising himself there  in the year      he published the first part of his polyolbion it is a chorographical description of the rivers mountains forests castles etc in this island intermixed with the remarkable antiquities rarities commodities etc this part is addressed to prince henry the promising son of james i by whose encouragement it was written he had showed drayton some singular marks of his favor and seems to have admitted him as one of his poetical pensioners but dying before the book was finished he lost the benefit of his patronage in this volume there are eighteen songs illustrated with the notes of the learned mr seldom and there are maps before every song whereby the cities mountains forests rivers etc are represented by the figures of men and women it is interwoven with many episodes such as the conquest of this island by the romans the arrival of the saxons the danes and normans etc and bishop nicholson oberves that polyolbion affords a much more accurate account of this kingdom and the dominion of wales than could have been expected from the pen of a poet how poetically our author has conducted and executed his plan is admirably expressed by the ingenious dr james kirkpatrick in a beautiful poem of his called the seapiece canto ii which i cannot here omit transcribing drayton sweet ancient bard his albion sung with their own praise their ecchoing valleys rung his bounding muse over every mountain rode and every river warbled where he flowed   in      came out his first folio volume of poems in      the second part of his polyolbion was published making in all thirty books or songs in      we find him styled poet laureat it is probable this appellation of poet laureat was not confined and restricted as it is now to his majestys servant known by that title who at that time it is presumed was ben johnson because it was bestowed promiscuously as a mark of any poets excellency in his profession  in      was published the second volume of his poems containing the battle of agencourt in stanzas of eight lines the mysteries of queen margaret in the like stanzas nymphidia or the court of faeries the quest of cynthia another beautiful piece both reprinted in drydens miscellanies the shepherds sirena also the moon calf satire on the masculine affectations of women and the effeminate disguises of the men in those times elegies upon several occasions these are introduced by the vision of ben johnson on the muse of his friend michael drayton wherein he very particularly enumerates and praises his several compositions in    0 he published another volume of poems in  to entitled the muses elysium in ten sundry nymphals with three different poems on noahs flood moses his birth and miracles and david and goliath the pastoral poems are addressed to edward sackville earl of dorset and lord chamberlain who had now made him one of his family his divine poems are written in verse and various measures and are dedicated to the countess of dorset and there are some sublime images in them at the end of the first divine poem there are copies of verses in praise of the author by beal sapperton in latin mr john fletcher and thomas andrews in english the last of whom is very lavish in displaying the great extent of our poets fame  in      mr drayton died or as it is expressed in his monumental inscription exchanged his laurel for a crown of glory he was buried among the poets in westminsterabbey and the handsome table monument of blue marble which was raised over his grave the same year is adorned with his effigies in busto laureated on one side is a crest of minervas cap and pegasus in a scutcheon on the other sir aston cokain composed an elegy upon him and ben johnson is said to have been the author of his epitaph which is written in letters of gold upon his monument with which i shall here present the reader epitaph do pious marble let thy readers know what they and what their children owe to draytons name whose sacred dust we recommend unto thy trust protect his memory and preserve his story remain a lasting monument of his glory and when thy ruins shall disclaim to be the treasure of his name his name that cannot fade shall be an everlasting monument to thee   mr drayton enjoyed the friendship and admiration of contemporary wits and ben johnson who was not much disposed to praise entertained a high opinion of him and in this epitaph has both immortalized himself and his friend it is easy for those who are conversant with our authors works to see how much the moderns and even mr pope himself copy mr drayton and refine upon him in those distinctions which are esteemed the most delicate improvements of our english versification such as the turns the pauses the elegant tautologies etc it is not difficult to point out some depredations which have been made on our author by modern writers however obsolete some of them may have reckoned him in one of his heroical epistles that of king john to matilda he has the following lines the arabian bird which never is but one is only chaste because she is alone but had our mother nature made them two they would have done as doves and sparrows do   these are ascribed to the earl of rochester who was unexceptionably a great wit they are not otherwise materially altered than by the transposure of the rhimes in the first couplet and the retrnchment of the measure in both as the sphere in which this author moved was of the middle sort neither raised to such eminence as to incur danger nor so deprest with poverty as to be subject to meanness his life seems to have flowed with great tranquillity nor are there any of those vicissitudes and distresses which have so frequently fallen to the lot of the inspired tribe he was honored with the patronage of men of worth though not of the highest stations and that author cannot be called a mean one on whom so great a man as seldom in many respects the most finished scholar that ever appeared in our nation was pleased to animadvert his genius seems to have been of the second rate much beneath spencer and sidney shakespeare and johnson but highly removed above the ordinary run of versifyers we shall quote a few lines from his polyolbion as a specimen of his poetry  when he speaks of his native county warwickshire he has the following lines upon the midlands now the industrious muse does fall that shire which we the heart of england well may call as she herself extends the midst which is decreed betwixt st michaels mount and berwick bordering tweed brave warwick that abroad so long advanced her bear by her illustrious earls renowned every where above her neighbring shires which always bore her head   dr richard corbet bishop of norwich was son of mr vincent corbet and born at ewelb in surry in the reign of queen elizabeth he was educated at westminster school and from thence was sent to oxford      where he was admitted a student in christchurch in   0  being then esteemed one of the greatest wits of the university he took the degree of master of arts and afterward entering into holy orders he became a popular preacher and much admired by people of taste and learning his shining wit and remarkable eloquence recommended him to king james i who made him one of his chaplains in ordinary and in    0 promoted him to the deanery of christschurch about which time he was made doctor of divinity vicar of cassington near woodstock in oxfordshire and prebendary of bedminstersecunda in the church of sarum athen oxon vol   col  00    while he was dean of christs church he made verses on a play acted before the king at woodstock called technogamia or the marriage of arts written by barten holiday the poet who afterward translated juvenal the illsuccess it met with in the representation occasioned several copies of verses among which to use anthony woods words corbet dean of christschurch put in for one who had that day it seems preached before the king with his band starched clean for which he was reproved by the graver sort but those who knew him well took no notice of it for they have several times said that he loved to the last boys play very well he was elected      bishop of oxford in the room of dr hewson translated to the sea of durham upon the promotion of dr white to ely he was elected bishop of norwich  this prelate married alice daughter of dr leonard hutton vicar of flower in northamptonshire and he mentions that village in a poem of his called iter boreale or a journey northward our author was in that celebrated class of poets ben johnson dr done michael drayton and others who wrote mock commendatory verses on tom coryates winstanley crudities he concurred likewise with other poets of the university in inviting ben johnson to oxford where he was created master of arts there is extant in the musaeum ashmoleanum a funeral oration in latin by dr corbet on the death of prince henry anno dom      wood ubi supra fol  0  this great man died in the year      and was buried the upperend of the choir of the cathedral church of norwich  he was very hospitable and a generous encourager of all public designs when in the year      st pauls cathedral was repaired he not only contributed himself but was very diligent in procuring contributions from others his works are difficult to be met with but from such of his poems as we have had occasion to read he seems to have been a witty delicate writer and to have had a particular talent for panegyric wood says a collection of his poems was published under the title of poetica stromata in  vo london      in his iter boreale or journey northward we meet with a fine moral reflection on the burial place of richard iii and cardinal wolsey who were both interred at and cardinal wolsey who were both interred at leicester with which we shall present the reader as a specimen of his poetry is not usurping richard buried here that king of hate and therefore slave of fear dragged from the fatal bosworth field where he i ost life and what he lived for  cruelty search find his name but there is none o kings remember whence your power and vastness springs if not as richard now so may you be who has no tomb but scorn and memory and though from his own store wolsey might have a palace or a college for his grave yet here he lies interred as if that all of him to be remembered were his fall nothing but earth on earth no pompous weight upon him but a pebble or a quoit if thou art thus neglected what shall we hope after death that are but shreds of thee   the author of the biographia britanica tells us that he found in a blank leaf of his poems some manuscript verses in honor of bishop corbet signed j c with which as they are extremely pretty and make a just representation of his poetical character we shall conclude this life in flowing wit if verses writ with ease if learning void of pedantry can please if much good humor joined to solid sense and mirth accompanied with innocence can give a poet a just right to fame then corbet may immortal honor claim for he these virtues had and in his lines poetic and heroic spirit shines though bright yet solid pleasant but not rude with wit and wisdom equally endued be silent muse thy praises are too faint thou want a power this prodigy to paint at once a poet prelate and a saint   edward fairfax all the biographers of the poets have been extremely negligent with respect to this great genias philips so far overlooks him that he crowds him into his supplement and winstanley who sollowed him postpones our author till after the earl of rochester sir thomas pope blount makes no mention of him and mr jacob so justly called the blunderbus of law informs us he wrote in the time of charles the first though he dedicates his translation of tasso to queen elizabeth all who mentin him do him the justice to allow he was an accomplished genius but then it is in a way so cool and indifferent as shows that they had never read his works or were any way charmed with the melody of his verses it was impossible mr dryden could be so blind to our authors beauties accordingly we find him introducing spenser and fairfax almost on the level as the leading authors of their times nay tacitly yielding the palm in point of harmony to the last by asserting that waller confessed he owed the music of his numbers to fairfaxs godfrey of bulloign the truth is this gentleman is perhaps the only writer down to sir william davenant who needs no apology to be made for him on account of the age in which he lived his diction is so pure elegant and full of graces and the turn of his lines so perfectly melodious that one cannot read it without rapture and we can scarcely imagine the original italian has greatly the advantage in either nor is it very probable that while fairfax can be read any author will attempt a new translation of tasso with success mr fairfax was natural son of sir thomas fairfax of denton and natural brother to sir thomas fairfax the first who was created baron of cameron his younger brother was knighted and slain at the memorable iege of ostend   0  of which place he was some time governor muses library p      when he married is not on record or in what circumstances he lived but it is very probable his father took care to support him in a manner suitable to his own quality and his sons extraordinary merit he being always styled edward fairfax esquire of newhall in fuystone in the forest of knaresborough the year in which he died is likewise uncertain and the last account we hear of him is that he was living in      which shows that he was then pretty well advanced in years and as i suppose gave occasion to the many mistakes that have been made as to the time of his writing besides the translation of godfrey of bulloigne mr fairfax wrote the history of edward the black prince and certain eclogues which mrs cooper tells us are yet in manuscript though says she by the indulgence of the family from whom i had likewise the honor of these memoirs i am permitted to oblige the world with a specimen of their beauties he wrote also a book called daemonologie in which he shows a great deal of ancient reading and knowledge it is still in manuscript and in the beginning he gives this character of himself muses library p      i am in religion neither a fantastic puritan nor superstitious papist but so settled in conscience that i have the sure ground of gods word to warrant all i believe and the commendable ordinances of our english church to approve all i practice in which course i live a faithful christian and an obedient and so teach my family the eclogues already mentioned are twelve in number all of them written after the accession of king james to the throne of england on important subjects relating to the manners characters and incidents of the times he lived in they are pointed with many fine strokes of satire dignified with noble instructions of morality and policy to those of the highest rank and some modest hints to majesty itself the learning contained in these eclogues is so various and extensive that according to the opinion of his son who has written long annotations on each no mans reading besides his own was sufficient to explain his references effectually as his translation of tasso is in every bodys hand we shall take the specimen from the fourth eclogue called eglon and alexis as i find it in mrs coopers collection eglon and alexis whilst on the rough and heathstrewd wilderness his tender flocks the rasps and bramble crop poor shepherd eglon full of sad distress by the small stream sat on a molehill top crowned with a wreath of heban branches broke whom good alexis found and thus bespoke  alexis my friend what means this silent lamentation why on this field of mirth this realm of smiles does the fierce war of grief make such invasion witty timanthes timanthes the painter who designing the sacrifice of iphigenia threw a veil over the face of agamemnon not able to express a fathers anguish had he seen ere whiles what face of woe thy cheek of sadness bears he had not curtained agamemnons tears the black ox treads not yet upon thy toe nor thy good fortune turns her wheel away thy flocks increase and thou increasest so thy straggling goats now mild and gentlely and that fool love thou whipst away with rods then what sets thee and joy so far at odds    thomas randolph a poet of no mean genius was born at newnham near daintry in northamptonshire the   th of june   0  he was son of william randolph of hams near jews in sussex was educated at westminster school and went from thence to trinity college in cambridge      of which he became a fellow he commenced master of arts and in this degree was incorporated at oxon athan oxon p      became famous says wood for his ingenuity being the adopted son of ben johnson and accounted one of the most pregnant wits of his age the quickness of his parts was discovered early when he was about nine or ten years old he wrote the history of the incarnation of our savior in verse which is preserved in manuscript under his own hand writing randolph receives from langbaine the highest encomium he tells his readers that they need expect no discoveries of thefts for this author had no occasion to practice plagiary having so large a fund of wit of his own that he needed not to borrow from others were a foreigner to form a notion of the merit of the english poets from reading langbaine they would be in raptures with randolph and durfey and others of their class while dryden and the firstrate wits would be quite neglected langbaine is so far generous that he does all he can to draw obscure men into light but then he cannot be acquitted of envy for endeavoring to shade the luster of those whose genius has broke through obscurity without his means and he does no service to his country while he confines his panegyric to mean versifiers whom no body can read without a certain degree of contempt  our author had done nothing in life it seems worth preserving or at least that cotemporary historians thought so for there is little to be learned concerning him wood says he was like other poets much addicted to libertine indulgence and by being too free with his constitution in the company of his admirers and running into fashionable excesses he was the means of shortening his own days he died at little haughton in northamptonshire and was buried in an isle adjoining to the church in that place on the   th of march      he had soon after a monument of white marble wreathed about with laurel erected over his grave at the charge of lord hatton of kirby perhaps the greatest merit which this author has to plead is his attachment to ben johnson and admiration of him silius italicus performed an annual visit to virgils tomb and that circumstance reflects more honor upon him in the eyes of virgils admirers than all the works of that author langbaine has preserved a monument of randolphs friendship for ben johnson in an ode he addressed to him occasioned by mr felthams severe attack upon him which is particularized in the life of ben from this ode we shall quote a stanza or two before i give an account of his dramatic compositions ben do not leave the stage cause it is a loathsome age for pride and impudence will grow too bold when they shall hear it told they frighted thee stand high as is thy cause their hiss is thy applause most just were thy disdain had they approved thy vein so thou for them and they for thee were born they to incense and thou too much to scorn will thou engross thy store of wheat and pour no more because their bacon brains have such a taste as more delight in mast no set them forth a board of dainties full as thy best muse can cull whilst they the while do pine and thirst midst all their wine what greater plague can hell itself devize than to be willing thus to tantalize   the reader may observe that the stanzas are reasonably smooth and mark him a tolerable versifier i shall now give some account of his plays   amyntas or the impossible dowry a pastoral acted before the king and queen at whitehall   aristippus or the jovial philosopher presented in a private show to which is added the conceited pedlar   jealous lovers a comedy presented to their majestys at cambridge by the students of trinity college this play langbaine thinks the best of randolphs as appears by an epilogue written by mrs behn and printed in her collection of poems published in  vo      it was revised and printed by the author in his lifetime being ushered into the world with copies of verses by some of the best wits both of oxford and cambridge   muses looking glass a comedy which by the author was first called the entertainment as appears from sir aston cokaines works who writ an encomium on it and mr richard west said of it who looks within this clearer glass will say at once he writ an ethic tract and play    all these dramatic pieces and poems were published in      he translated likewise the second epod of horace several pieces out of claudian and likewise a dramatic piece from aristophanes which he calls hey for honesty down with knavery a pleasant comedy printed in  to london      a gentleman of st johns college writes thus in honor of our author immortal ben is dead and as that ball on ida tossed so in his crown by all the infantry of wit vain priests that chair is only fit for his true son and heir reach here thy laurel randolph it is thy praise thy naked skull shall well become the bays see daphne courts thy ghost and spite of fate thy poems shall be poet laureate   george chapman was born in the year      but of what family he is descended mr wood has not been able to determine he was a man in very high reputation in his time and added not a little to dramatic excellence in      being well grounded in grammar learning he was sent to the university but it is not clear whether to oxford or cambridge it is certain that he was sometime in oxford and was taken notice of for his great skill in the latin and greek languages but not in logic and philosophy which is the reason it may be presumed that he took no degree there after this he came to london and contracted an acquaintance as wood says with shakespeare johnson sidney spenser and daniel he met with a very warm patronage from sir thomas walsingham who had always had a constant friendship for him and after that gentlemans decease from his son thomas walsingham esquire whom chapman loved from his birth he was also respected and held in esteem by prince henry and robert earl of somerset but the first being untimely snatched away and the other justly disgraced for an assassination see the life of overbury  his hopes of preferment were by these means frustrated however he was a servant either to king james i or queen anne his consort through whose reign he was highly valued by all his old friends only there are some insinuations that as his reputation grew ben johnson naturally haughty and insolent became jealous of him and endeavored to suppress as much as possible his rising fame woods athen oxon  as ben after the death of shakespeare was without a rival  chapman was a man of a reverend aspect and graceful manner religious and temperate qualities which seldom meet says wood in a poet and was so highly esteemed by the clergy that some of them have said that as musaeus who wrote the lives of hero and leander had two excellent scholars thamarus and hercules so had he in england in the latter end of queen elizabeth two excellent imitators in the same argument and subject viz christopher marlow and george chapman our author has translated the iliad of homer published in folio and dedicated to prince henry which is yet looked upon with some respect he is said to have had the spirit of a poet in him and was indeed no mean genius pope somewhere calls him an enthusiast in poetry he likewise translated the odyssey and the battle of frogs and mice which were published in      and dedicated to the earl of somerset to this work is added hymns and epigrams written by homer and translated by our author he likewise attempted some part of hesiod and continued a translation of musaeuss aerotopegnion de herone and leandro prefixed to this work are some anecdotes of the life of musaeus taken by chapman from the collection of dr william gager and a dedication to the most generally ingenious and only learned architect of his time inigo jones esquire surveyor of his majestys works at length says wood this reverend and eminent poet having lived    years in this vain transitory world made his last exit in the parish of st giless in the fields near london on the   th day of may      and was buried in the yard on the south side of the church in st giless soon after a monument was erected over his grave built after the manner of the old romans at the expense and under the direction of his much loved worthy friend inigo jones whereon is this engraven georgius chapmannus poeta homericus philosophus verus etsi christianus poeta plusquam celebris etc  his dramatic works are all fools a comedy presented at the black friars and afterward before his majesty king james i in the beginning of his reign and printed in  to london   0  the plot is taken and the characters formed upon terences heautontimorumenos the prologue and epilogue writ in blank verse show that in these days persons of quality and they that thought themselves good critics in place of sitting in the boxes as they now do sat on the stage what influence those people had on the meanest sort of the audience may be seen by the following lines in the prologue written by chapman himself great are the gifts given to united heads to gifts attire to fair attire the stage helps much for if our other audience see you on the stage depart before we end our wit goes with you all and we are fools alphonsus emperor of germany a tragedy often acted with applause at a private house in black friars by the servants of king charles i printed in  to london      this play though it bears the name of alphonsus was writ as langbaine supposes in honor of the english nation in the person of richard earl of cornwall son to king john and brother to henry iii he was chosen king of the romans in      about this time alphonsus the french king was chosen by other electors though this king was accounted by some a pious prince yet our author represents him as a bloody tyrant and contrary to other historians brings him to an unfortunate end he supposing him to be killed by alexander son to lorenzo de cipres his secretary in revenge of his father who was poisoned by him and to complete his revenge he makes him first deny his savior in hopes of life and then stabs him glorying that he had at once destroyed both body and soul this passage is related by several authors as boltons four last things reynolds of the passions clarks examples etc blind beggar of alexandria a comedy printed      dedicated to the earl of nottingham lord high admiral bussy damboise a tragedy often presented at st pauls in the reign of king james i and since the restoration with great applause for the plot see thuanus jean de serres and mezeray in the reign of king henry iii of france this is the play of which mr dryden speaks when in his preface to the spanish friar he resolves to burn one annually to the memory of ben johnson some have differed from mr dryden in their opinion of this piece but as the authorities who have applauded are not so high as mr drydens single authority it is most reasonable to conclude not much in its favor bussy damboise his revenge a tragedy printed      and dedicated to sir thomas howard this play is generally allowed to fall short of the former of that name yet the author as appears from his dedication had a higher opinion of it himself and rails at those who dared to censure it it is founded upon fiction which chapman very justly defends and says that there is no necessity for any play being founded on truth conspiracy and tragedy of charles duke of byron marshal of france in two plays acted at the black friars in the reign of king james i printed in  to

best dramatic poets of the   th century was descended from a scots family his grandfather who was a gentleman being originally of annandale in that kingdom whence he removed to carlisle and afterward was employed in the service of king henry viii his father lost his estate under queen mary in whose reign he suffered imprisonment and at last entered into holy orders and died about a month before our poets birth drummond of hawthorndens works fol     edinbargh edition       who was born at westminster says wood in the year      he was first educated at a private school in the church of st martins in the fields afterward removed to westminster school where the famous camden was master his mother who married a bricklayer to her second husband took him from school and obliged him to work at his fatherinlaws trade but being extremely averse to that employment he went into the low countries where he distinguished himself by his bravery having in the view of the army killed an enemy and taken the opima spolia from him  upon his return to england he applied himself again to his former studies and wood says he was admitted into st johns college in the university of cambridge though his continuance there seems to have been but short he had some time after this the misfortune to fight a duel and kill his adversary who only slightly wounded him in the arm for this he was imprisoned and being cast for his life was near execution his antagonist he said had a sword ten inches longer than his own  while he lay in prison a popish priest visited him who found his inclination quite disengaged as to religion and therefore took the opportunity to impress him with a belief of the popish tenets his mind then naturally melancholy clouded with apprehensions and the dread of execution was the more easily imposed upon however such was the force of that impression that for twelve years after he had gained his liberty he continued in the catholic faith and at last turned protestant whether from conviction or fashion cannot be determined but when the character of ben is considered probability will be upon the side of the latter for he took every occasion to ridicule religion in his plays and make it his sport in conversation on his leaving the university he entered himself into an obscure playhouse called the green curtain somewhere about shoreditch or clerkenwell he was first an actor and probably only a strolling one for decker in his satyromastix a play published in   0  and designed as a reply to johnsons poetaster reproaches him with having left the occupation of a mortar trader to turn actor and with having put up a supplication to be a poor journeyman player in which he would have continued but that he could not set a good face upon it and so was cashiered besides if we admit that satie to be built on facts we learn further that he performed the part of zuliman at the paris garden in southwark and ambled by a playwaggon on the highway and took mad jeronymos part to get service amongst the mimicks birchs lives of illustrious men  shakespeare is said to have first introduced him to the world by recommending a play of his to the stage at the time when one of the players had rejected his performance and told him it would be of no service to their company see shakespeare  his first printed dramatic performance was a comedy entitled every man in his humor acted in the year      which being soon followed by several others as his sejanus his volpone his silent woman and his alchymist gained him so high a reputation that in october      upon the death of mr samuel daniel he was made poet laureat to king james i and on the   th of july the same year he was created says wood master of arts at oxford having resided for some time at christ church in that university he once incurred his majestys displeasure for being concerned with chapman and marston in writing a play called eastwardhoe wherein they were accused of having reflected upon the scotch nation sir james murray represented it to the king who ordered them immediately to be imprisoned and they were in great danger of losing their ears and noses as a correction of their wantonness nor could the most partial have blamed his majesty if the punishment had been inflicted for surely to ridicule a country from which their sovereign had just come the place of his nativity and the kingdom of his illustrious forefathers was a most daring insult upon their releasement from prison our poet gave an entertainment to his friends among whom were camden and seldom when his aged mother drank to him see drummonds works and showed him a paper of poison which she had designed if the sentence of punishment had been inflicted to have mixed with his drink after she had first taken a potion of it herself  upon the accession of charles i to the crown he wrote a petition to that prince craving that as his royal father had allowed him an annual pension of a hundred marks he would make them pounds in the year      ben fell sick and was then poor and lodged in an obscure alley his majesty was supplicated in his favor who sent him ten guineas when the messenger delivered the sum ben took it in his hand and said his majesty has sent me ten guineas because i am poor and live in an alley go and tell him that his soul lives in an alley  he had a pension from the city of london from several of the nobility and gentry and particularly from mr sutton the founder of the charterhouse wood  in his last sickness he often repented of the profanation of scripture in his plays he died the   th of august      in the   d year of his age and was interred three days after in westminster abbey he had several children who survived him  ben johnson conceived so high an opinion of mr drummond of hawthornden by the letters which passed between them that he undertook a journey into scotland and resided some time at mr drummonds seat there who has printed the heads of their conversation and as it is a curious circumstance to know the opinion of so great a man as johnson of his cotemporary writers these heads are here inserted  ben says mr drummond was eat up with fancies he told me that about the time the plague raged in london being in the country at sir robert cottons house with old camden he saw in a vision his eldest son then a young child and at london appear unto him with the mark of a bloody cross on his forehead as if it had been cut with a sword at which amazed he prayed unto god and in the morning he came to mr camdens chamber to tell him who persuaded him it was but an apprehension at which he should not be dejected in the mean time there came letters from his wife of the death of that boy in the plague he appeared to him he said of a manly shape and of that growth he thinks he shall be at the resurrection he said he spent many a night in looking at his great toe about which he had seen tartars and turks romans and carthaginians fight in his imagination  that he had a design to write an epic poem and was to call it chrologia or the worthies of his country all in couplets for he detested all other rhyme he said he had written a discourse on poetry both against campion and daniel especially the last where he proves couplets to be the best sort of verses    his censure of the english poets was as follows that sidney did not keep a decorum in making every one speak as well as himself spensers stanza pleased him not nor his matter the meaning of the allegory of the fairy queen he delivered in writing to sir walter raleigh which was that by the bleating beast he understood the puritans and by the false duessa the queen of scots samuel daniel was a good honest man had no children and was no poet and that he had wrote the civil wars without having one battle in all his book that draytons polyolbion if he had performed what he promised to write the deeds of all the worthies had been excellent that sylvesters translation of du bartas was not well done and that he wrote his verses before he understood to confer and those of fairfax were not good that the translations of homer and virgil in long alexandrines were but prose that sir john harringtons ariosto of all translations was the worst he said done was originally a poet his grandfather on the mothers side was heywood the epigramatist that done for not being understood would perish he affirmed that done wrote all his best pieces before he was twenty years of age he told done that his anniversary was profane and full of blasphemies that if it had been written on the virgin mary it had been tolerable to which done answered that he described the idea of a woman but not as she was that sir walter raleigh esteemed fame more than conscience the best wits in england were employed in making his history ben himself had written a piece to him on the punic war which he altered and put in his book he said there was no such ground for an heroic poem as king arthurs fiction and sir philip sidney had an intention of turning all his arcadia to the stories of king arthur he said owen was a poor pedantic schoolmaster sucking his living from the posteriors of little children and has nothing good in him his epigrams being bare narrations he loved fletcher beaumont and chapman that sir william alexander was not half kind to him and neglected him because a friend to drayton that sir r ayton loved him dearly he fought several times with marston and says that marston wrote his father in laws preachings and his father in law his comedies    mr drummond has represented the character of our author in a very disadvantageous though perhaps not in a very unjust light that he was a great lover and praiser of himself a contemner and scorner of others rather choosing to lose a friend than a jest jealous of every word and action of those about him especially after drink which was one of the elements in which he lived a dissembler of the parts which reigned in him a bragger of some good that he wanted he thought nothing right but what either himself or some of his friends had said or done he was passionately kind and angry careless either to gain or to keep vindictive but if he was well answered greatly chagrined interpreting the best sayings and deeds often to the worst he was for any religion being versed in all his inventions were smooth and easy but above all he excelled in translation in short he was in his personal character the very reverse of shakespeare as surly illnatured proud and disagreeable as shakespeare with ten times his merit was gentle goodnatured easy and amiable he had a very strong memory for he tells himself in his discoveries that he could in his youth have repeated all that he had ever written and so continued till he was past sorty and even after that he could have repeated whole books that he had read and poems of some select friends which he thought worth remembering  mr pope remarks that when ben got possession of the stage he brought critical learning into vogue and that this was not done without difficulty which appears srom those frequent lessons and indeed almost declamations which he was forced to prefix to his first plays and put into the mouths of his actors the grex chorus etc to remove the prejudices and inform the judgment of his hearers till then the english authors had no thoughts of writing upon the model of the ancients their tragedies were only histories in dialogue and their comedies followed the thread of any novel as they found it no less implicitly than if it had been true history mr seldom in his preface to his titles of honor styles johnson his beloved friend and a singular poet and extols his special worth in literature and his accurate judgment mr dryden gives him the title of the greatest man of the last age and observes that if we look upon him when he was himself for his last plays were but his dotages he was the most learned and judicious writer any theater ever had that he was a most severe judge of himself as well as others that we cannot say he wanted wit but rather that he was frugal of it that in his works there is little to be retrenched or altered but that humor was his chief province  ben had certainly no great talent for versification nor does he seem to have had an extraordinary ear his verses are often wanting in syllables and sometimes have too many  i shall quote some lines of his poem to the memory of shakespeare before i give a detail of his pieces to the memory of my beloved the author mr william shakespeare and what he has left us to draw no envy shakespeare on thy name am i thus ample to thy book and fame while i confess thy writings to be such as neither man nor muse can praise too much it is true and all mens suffrage but these ways were not the paths i meant unto thy praise for silliest ignorance on these may light which when it sounds at best but echoes right as blind affection which does never advance the truth but gropes and urges all by chance a crfty malice might pretend his praise and think to ruin where it seemed to raise these are as some infamous baud or whore should praise a matron what could hurt her more but thou art proof against them and indeed above the ill fortune of them or the need i therefore will begin soul of the age the applause delight the wonder of the stage my shakespeare rise i will not lodge thee by chaucer or spenser or bid beaumont lie a little further to make thee a room thou art a monument without a tomb and art alive still while the book does live and we have wits to read and praise to give that i not mix thee so my brain excuses i mean with great but disproportioned muses for if i thought my judgment were of years i should commit thee surely with thy peers and tell how far thou did our lily outshine or sporting kid or marlows mighty line   he then goes on to challenge all antiquity to match shakespeare but the poetry is so miserable that the reader will think the above quotation long enough  ben has wrote above fifty several pieces which we may rank under the species of dramatic poetry of which i shall give an account in order beginning with one of his best comedies    alchymist a comedy acted in the year    0 mr dryden supposes this play was copied from the comedy of albumazer as far as concerns the alchymists

light let lowen cease and tailor scorn to touch the loathed stage for thou have made it such these lines are without wit and without poetry they contain a mean reflection on bens original employment

silent woman met not with success when revived last year at drury lane theater let the new critics or the actors of the new mode determine  thus have we given a detail of ben johnsons works he is allowed to have been a scholar and to have understood and practiced the dramatic rules but dryden proves him to have likewise been an unbounded plagiary humor was his talent and he had a happy turn for an epitaph we cannot better conclude his character as a poet than in the nervous lines of the prologue quoted in the life of shakespeare  after having shown shakespeares boundless genius he continues then johnson came instructed from the school to please by method and invent by rule his studious patience and laborious art with regular approach assayed the heart cold approbation gave the lingering bays for they who durst not censure scarce could praise   thomas carew esquire was descended of a very ancient and reputable family of the carews in devonshire and was brother to matthew carew a great royalist in the time of the rebellion he had his education in corpus christi college but he appears not to have been matriculated as a member or that he took a scholastic degree woods athen oxon p   0 vol i  afterward improving his parts by traveling and conversation with ingenious men in the metropolis he acquired some reputation for his wit and poetry about this time being taken notice of at court for his ingenuity he was made gentleman of the privy chamber and sewer in ordinary to king charles i who always esteemed him to the last one of the most celebrated wits about his court woods ubi supra  he was much esteemed and respected by the poets of his time especially by ben johnson sir john suckling who had a great kindness for him could not let him pass in his session of poets without this character tom carew was next but he had a fault that would not well stand with a laureat his muse was hidebound and the issue ofs brain was seldom brought forth but with trouble and

sighing blasts and weeping rain yet she refuses to unfold but when the planet of the day approaches with his powerful ray then she spreads then she receives his warmer beams into her virgin leaves so shall thou thrive in love fond boy if thy tears and sighs discover thy grief thou never shall enjoy the just reward of a bold lover but when with moving accents thou shall constant faith and service vow thy celia shall receive those charms with open ears and with unfolded arms   sir william davenant has given an honorable testimony in favor of our author with which i shall conclude his life after observing that this elegant author died much regretted by some of the best wits of his time in the year       sir william davenant thus addresses him not that thy verses are so smooth and high as glory love and wine from wit can raise but now the devil take such destiny what should commend them turns to their dispraise thy wits chief virtue is become its vice for every beauty thou have raised so high that now coarse saces carry such a price as must undo a lover that would buy   sir henry wotton this great man was born in the year      at bocton hall in the county of kent descended of a very ancient family who distinguished themselves in the wars between the scotch and english before the union of crowns the father of sir henry wotton according to the account of the learned bishop walton was twice married and after the death of his second wife says the bishop his inclination though naturally averse to all contentions yet necessitated he was to have several suits of law which took up much of his time he was by diverse of his friends persuaded to remarriage to whom he often answered that if he did put on a resolution to marry he seriously resolved to avoid three sorts of persons namely  those that had children  law suits  were of his kindred and yet following his own law suit he met in westminster hall with one mrs morton the widow of a gentleman of kent who was engaged in several suits in law and observing her comportment the time of her hearing one of her causes before the judges he could not but at the same time compassionate her condition and so affect her person that though there were in her a concurrence of all those accidents against which he had so seriously resolved yet his affection grew so strong that he then resolved to solicit her for a wife and did and obtained her  by this lady he had our author who received the rudiments of his education from his mother who was it seems a woman of taste and capable of inspiring him with a love of polite accomplishments when he became fit for an academical education he was placed in new college in oxford in the beginning of the year      where living in the condition of a gentleman commoner he contracted an intimacy with sir richard baker afterward an eminent historian sir henry did not long continue there but removed to queens college where says walton he made a great progress in logic and philosophy and wrote a tragedy for the use of that college called tarroredo walton tells us that this tragedy was so interwoven with sentences and for the exact personating those passions and humors he proposed to represent he so performed that the gravest of the society declared that he had in a slight employment given an early and solid testimony of his future abilities  on the  th of june says wood      he as a member of queens college supplicated the venerable congregation of regents that he might be admitted to the degree of bachelor of arts which desire was granted conditionally that he should determine the lent following but whether he was admitted or did determine or took any degree does not appear in any of the university registers though mr walton says that about the twentieth year of his age he proceeded master of arts and at that time read in latin three lectures de ocello during the time he was at the university and gaining much upon mankind by the reputation of his abilities his father for whom he had the highest veneration died and left him a hundred marks a year to be paid out of one of his manors of great value walton proceeds to relate a very astonishing circumstance concerning the father of our author which as it is of the visionary sort the reader may credit or not as he pleases it is however too curious to be here omitted especially as the learned prelate walton already mentioned has told it with great earnestness as if he was persuaded of its reality  in the year      nicholas wotton dean of canterbury uncle to our authors father being ambassador in france in the reign of queen mary dreamed that his nephew thomas wotton was disposed to be a party in a very hazardous project which if not suddenly prevented would issue in the loss of his life and the ruin of his family the dean who was persuaded of the importance of his own dream was very uneasy but lest he should be thought superstitious he resolved to conceal the circumstance and not to acquaint his nephew or any body else with it but dreaming the same a second time he determined to put something in execution in consequence of it he accordingly wrote to the queen to send for his nephew thomas wotton out of kent and that the lords of the council might examine him about some imaginary conspiracy so as to give color for his being committed to jail declaring that he would acquaint her majesty with the true reason of his request when he should next be so happy to pay his duty to her the queen complied with the deans desire who at that time it seems had great influence with that bigoted princess  about this time a marriage was concluded between the queen of england and philip king of spain which not a little disobliged some of the nobility who were jealous lest their country by such a match should be subjected to the dominion of spain and their independent rights invaded by that imperious monarch these suspicions produced an insurrection which was headed by the duke of suffolk and sir thomas wyat who both lost their lives in the attempt to prevent the match by seizing the queen for the design was soon discovered easily defeated and those two persons with many more suffered on a scaffold  between sir thomas wyat and the wottons family there had been a long intimacy and sir thomas had really won mr wotton over to his interest and had he not been prevented by imprisonment he afterward declared that he would have joined his friend in the insurrection and in all probability would have fallen a sacrifice to the queens resentment and the votaries of the spanish match  after sir henry quitted the university of oxford he traveled into france germany and italy where he resided above nine years and returned to his own country perfectly accomplished in all the polite improvements which men of sense acquire by traveling and well acquainted with the temper and genius of the people with whom he had conversed and the different policy of their governments he was soon taken notice of after his return and became secretary to the famous robert devereux earl of essex that unfortunate favorite whose story is never exhibited on the stage says mr addison without affecting the heart in the most sensible manner with his lordship he continued in the character of secretary till the earl was apprehended for his mtinous behavior toward the queen and put upon his trial wotton who did not think it safe to continue in england after the fall of his master retired to florence became acquainted with the great duke of tuscany and rose so high in his favor that he was entrusted by him to carry letters to james vi king of scots under the name of octavio baldi in order to inform that king of a design against his life walton informs us that though queen elizabeth was never willing to declare her successor yet the king of scots was generally believed to be the person on whom the crown of england would devolve the queen declining very fast both through age and visible infirmities those that were of the romish persuasion in point of religion knowing that the death of the queen and establishing her succession was the crisis for destroying or supporting the protestant religion in this nation did therefore improve all opportunities for preventing a protestant prince to succeed her and as the popes excommunication of queen elizabeth had both by the judgment and practice of the jesuited papists exposed her to be warrantably destroyed so about that time there were many endeavors first to excommunicate and then to shorten the life of king james vi  immediately after wottons return from rome to florence which was about a year before the death of queen elizabeth ferdinand the great duke had intercepted certain letters which discovered a design against the life of the king of scots the duke abhorring the scheme of asfassination and resolving to prevent it advised with his secretary vietta by what means a caution should be given to the scotch prince vietta recommended wotton as a person of the highest abilities of any englishman then at his court mr wotton was sent for by his friend vietta to the duke who after many professions of trust and friendship acquainted him with the secret and sent him to scotland with letters to the king and such antidotes against poison as till then the scots had been strangers to mr wotton having departed from the duke assumed the name and language of an italian which he spoke so fluently and with so little mixture of a foreign dialect that he could scarcely be distinguished from a native of italy and thinking it best to avoid the line of english intelligence and danger posted into norway and through that country toward scotland where he found the king at stirling  when he arrived there he used means by one of the gentlemen of his majestys bedchamber to procure a speedy and private audience of his majesty declaring that the business which he was to negotiate was of such consequence as had excited the great duke of tuscany to enjoin him suddenly to leave his native country of italy to impart it to the king  the king being informed of this after a little wonder mixed with jealousy to hear of an italian ambassador or messenger appointed a private audience that evening when mr wotton came to the presence chamber he was desired to lay aside his long rapier and being entered found the king there with three or four scotch lords standing distant in several corners of the chamber at the sight of whom he made a stand and which the king observing bid him be bold and deliver his message and he would undertake for the secresy of all who were present upon this he delivered his message and letters to his majesty in italian which when the king had graciously received after a little pause mr wotton stepped up to the table and whispered to the king in his own language that he was an englishman requesting a more private conference with his majesty and that he might be concealed during his stay in that nation which was promised and really performed by the king all the time he remained at the scotch court he then returned to the duke with a satisfactory account of his employment  when king james succeeded to the throne of england he found among others of queen elizabeths officers sir edward wotton afterward lord wotton comptroller of the household whom he asked one day whether he knew one henry wotton who had spent much time in foreign travel sir edward replied that he knew him well and that he was his brother the king then asked where he was and upon sir edwards answering that he believed he would soon be at paris send for him says his majesty and when he comes to england bid him repair privately to me sir edward after a little wonder asked his majesty whether he knew him to which the king answered you must rest unsatisfied of that till you bring the gentleman to me not many months after this discourse sir edward brought his brother to attend the king who took him in his arms and bid him welcome under the name of octavio baldi saying that he was the most honest and therefore the best dissembler he ever met with and seeing i know added the king you want neither learning travel nor experience and that i have had so real a testimony of your faithfulness and abilities to manage an embassage i have sent for you to declare my purposes which is to make use of you in that kind hereafter walton ubi supra  but before he dismissed octavio baldi from his present attendance he restored him to his old name of henry wotton by which he then knighted him  not long after this king james having resolved according to his motto of beati pacifici to have a friendship with his neighboring kingdoms of france and spain and also to enter into an alliance with the state of venice and for that purpose to send ambassadors to those several states offered to sir henry his choice of which ever of these employments best suited his inclination who from the consideration of his own personal estate being small and the courts of france and spain extremely sumptuous so as to expose him to expenses above his fortune made choice of venice a place of more retirement and where he could execute his embassy and at the same time indulge himself in the study of natural philosophy in that seat of the sciences where he was sure to meet with men accomplished in all the polite improvements as well as the more solid seize of philosophy having informed the king that he chose to be sent to venice his majesty settled a very considerable allowance upon him during his stay there he then took his leave and was accompanied through france to venice says walton by gentlemen of the best families and breeding that this nation afforded  when sir henry wotton arrived at venice there subsisted between the venetians and the pope a very warm contention which was prosecuted by both parties with equal fury the laity made many complaints against the two frequent practice of land being left to the church without a license from the state which increased the power of the clergy already too great and rendered their insolence insupportable in consequence of this the state made several injunctions against laypersons disposing their lands in that manner another cause of their quarrel was that the venetians had sent to rome several articles of complaint against two priests the abbot of nervesa and a canon of vicenza for committing such abominable crimes as mr walton says it would be a shame to mention their complaints met with no redress and the detestable practices of these monsters in holy orders still continuing they seized their persons and committed them to prison  the justice or injustice of such power exercised by the venetians produced debates between the republic and pope clement viii clement soon dying pope paul the first a man of unbounded insolence and elated with his spiritual superiority let loose all his rage against the state he judged all resistance to be a diminution of his power and threatened excommunication to the whole state if a revocation was not instantly made which the venetians rejecting he proceeded in menaces and at last did excommunicate the duke the whole senate and all their dominions then he shut up the churches charging the clergy to forbear sacred offices to any of the venetians till their obedience should make them capable of absolution the contention was thus fomented till a report prevailed that the venetians were turned protestants which was believed by many as the english ambassador was so often in conference with the senate and that they had made all their proceedings known to the king of england who would support them should the pope presume to exercise any more oppressions this circumstance made it appear plain enough to his holiness that he weakened his power by exceeding it and being alarmed lest a revolution should happen offered the venetians absolution upon very easy terms which the republic still slighting did at last obtain it by that which was scarce so much as a show of desiring it  for eight years after sir henry wottons going into italy he stood very high in the kings esteem but at last lost his favor for some time by an accident too singular to be here omitted  when he first went ambassador to italy as he passed through germany he staid some days at augsburgh where having been in his former travels well known by many of the first reputation in learning and passing an evening in merriment he was desired by christopher hecamore to write a sentence in his album and consenting to it took occasion from some accidental conversation which happened in the company to write a pleasant definition of an ambassador in these words legatus est vir bonus peregremissus ad mentiendum republicae causa which he chose should have been thus rendered into english an ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his country but the word lie upon which the conceit turned was not so expressed in latin as to admit a double meaning or so far a construction as sir henry thought in english about eight years after this album fell into the hands of gaspar scioppius a restless zealot who published books against king james and upbraided him for entertaining such scandalous principles as his ambassador had expressed by that sentence this aspersion gained ground and it became fashionable in venice to write this definition in several glass windows these incidents reaching the ear of king james he was much displeased with the behavior of his ambassador on that occasion and from an innocent piece of witticism sir henry was like to pay very dear by losing his masters favor upon this our author wrote two apologies one to velserus which was dispersed in germany and italy and another to the king both which were so well written that his majesty upon reading them declared that sir henry wotton had sufficiently commutted for a greater offense  upon this reconciliation sir henry became more in favor with his majesty than ever like friends who have been for some time separated they meet again with double fervor and their friendship increases to a greater warmth during the twenty years which sir henry was ambassador at venice he had the good fortune to be so well respected by all the dukes and the leading men of the republic that his interest every year increased and they seldom denied him any favor he asked for his countrymen who came to venice which was as walton expresses it a city of refuge sor all englishmen who were any way distressed in that republic walton proceeds to relate two particular instances of the generosity and tenderness of his disposition and the nobleness of his mind which as they serve to illustrate his character deserve a place here  there had been many englishmen brought by commanders of their own country to serve the venetians sor pay against the turks and those english by irregularities and imprudence committed such offenses as brought them into prisons and exposed them to work in galleys wotton could not be an unconcerned spectator of the miseries of his countrymen their offenses he knew proceeded rather from wantonness and intemperance than any real principles of dishonor and therefore he thought it not beneath him to become a petitioner for their releasement he was happy in a successful representation of their calamities they were set at liberty and had an opportunity of returning to their own country in comfort in place of languishing in jails and being slaves at the galleys and by this compassionate interposition with the republic he had the blessings of many miserable wretches the highest pleasure which any human being can enjoy on this side immortality  of the generosity and nobleness of his mind walton gives this instance  upon sir henry wottons coming a second time to venice he was employed as ambassador to several of the german princes and to the emperor ferdinando ii and this embassy to these princes was to incline them to equitable measures for the restoration of the queen of bohemia and her descendants to their patrimonial inheritance of the palatinate this was by eight months constant endeavors and attendance upon the emperor and his court brought to a probability of a successful conclusion by a treaty but about that time the emperors army fought a battle so fortunately as put an end to the expected treaty and sir henry wottons hopes who when he quitted the emperors court humbly advised him to use his victory with moderation which advice the emperor was pleased to hear graciously being well satisfied with wottons behavior during his residence at his court he then told him that though the king his master was looked upon as an abetter of his enemy yet he could not help demonstrating his regard to him by making him a present of a rich jewel of diamonds worth more than ten thousand pounds this was received with all possible respect by sir henry but the next morning upon his departing from vienna at his taking leave of the countess of sabrina an italian lady in whose house he resided he expressed his gratitude for her civilities by presenting her with the jewel given him by the emperor which being afterward discovered was by the emperor taken as an affront but sir henry acknowledging his gratitude for the mark of distinction shown to him at the same time declared he did not choose to receive profit from any present given him by an enemy of his royal mistress for so the queen of bohemia the eldest daughter of the king of england permitted him to call her  upon sir henry wottons return from his embassy he signified an inclination to the king to be excused from any further employment in foreign affairs to retire from the bustle of life and spend the evening of his days in studious ease and tranquillity his majesty in consequence of this request promised him the reversion of an office which was the place of master of the rolls if he outlived sir julius caesar who then possessed it and was grown so old that he was said to be kept alive beyond natures course by the prayers of the many people who daily lived upon his bounty here it will not be improper to observe that sir henry wotton had through a generosity of temper reduced his affairs to such a state that he could not live without some profitable employment as he was indebted to many persons for money he borrowed to support his dignity in his embassy the kings appointment for that purpose being either not regularly paid or too inconsiderable for the expense this rendered it impossible for him to wait the death of sir julius caesar besides that place had been long solicited by that worthy gentleman for his son and it would have been thought an illnatured office to have by any means prevented it  it luckily happened at this time that the provostship of his majestys college at eaton became vacant by the death of mr murray for which there were many earnest and powerful solicitations this place was admirably suited to the course of life wotton resolved to pursue for the remaining part of his days he had seen enough of the world to be sick of it and being now threescore years of age he thought a college was the fittest place to indulge contemplation and to rest his body and mind after a long struggle on the theater of life in his suit for this place he was happily successful and immediately entered into holy orders which was necessary before he could take possession of his new office walton has related the particular manner of his spending his time which was divided between attendance upon public devotion the more private duties of religion and the care which his function demanded from him of the affairs of the college in the year      sir henry died in eatoncollege and was buried in the chapel belonging to it he directed the following sentence to be put upon a marble monument to be erected over him hic jacit hujus sententiae primus author disputandi pruritus ecclesiarum scabies nomen alias quaere    which may be thus rendered into english here lies the first author of this sentence  the itch of disputation will prove the scab of the church  enquire his name elsewhere    sir henry wotton has been allowed by all critics to be a man of real and great genius an upright statesman a polite courtier compassionate and benevolent to those in distress charitable to the poor and in a word an honest man and a pious christian as a poet he seems to have no consideraable genius his versification is harmonious and sometimes has an air of novelty his turns are elegant and his thoughts have both dignity and propriety to recommend them there is a little piece amongst his collections called the world which we shall quote before we give an account of his works the worlds a bubble and the life of man less than a span in his conception wretched from the womb so to the tomb nursed from his cradle and brought up to years with cares and fears who then to frail mortality shall trust but lymns in water or but writes in dust yet whilst with sorrow here we live oppressed what life is best courts are but only superficial schools to dandle fools the rural part is turned into a den of savage men and where is a city from vice so free but may be termed the worst of all the three domestic cares afflict the husbands bed or pains his head those that live single take it for a curse or do things worse these would have children those that have them none or wish them gone what is it then to have or have no wife but single thraldom or a double strife our own affections still at home to please is a disease to cross the seas to any foreign soil peril and toil wars with their noise affright us when they cease we are worse in peace what then remains but that we still should cry for being born and being born to die   he is author of the following works epistola de casparo scioppio amberg       vo this scioppius was a man of restless spirit and had a malicious pen who in books against king james took occasion from a sentence written by sir henry wotton in a germans

volumes of husbandry and horsemanship besides what he has wrote on rural recreations and military discipline he understood both the practice and theory of war and was esteemed an excellent linguist being master of the french italian and spanish languages from all which he collected observations on husbandry one piece of dramatic poetry which he has published says mr langbaine will show that he sacrificed to apollo and the muses as well as mars and pallas this play is extant under the title of  herod and antipater a tragedy printed  to      when or where this play was acted mr langbaine cannot determine for says he the imperfection of my copy hinders my information for the foundation it is built on history see josephus mr langbaine then proceeds to enumerate his other works which he says are famous over all england of these he has wrote a discourse of horsemanship printed  to without date and dedicated to prince henry eldest son to king james i cure of all diseases incident to

langbaine if not unus in omnibus at least a benefactor to the public by those works he left behind him which without doubt perpetuate his memory langbaine is lavish in his praise and not altogether undeservedly to have lived a military life which too often engages its professors in a dissipated course of pleasure and at the same time make himself master of such a variety of knowledge and yield so much application to study entitles him to hold some rank in literature in poetry he has no name perhaps because he did not apply himself to it so true is the observation that a great poet is seldom any thing else poetry engages all the powers of the mind and when we consider how difficult it is to acquire a name in a profession which demands so many requisites it will not appear strange that the sons of apollo should seldom be found to yield sufficient attention to any other excellence so as to possess it in an equal degree  thomas heywood lived in the reign of queen elizabeth and king james i he was an actor as appears from the evidence of mr kirkman and likewise from a piece written by him called the actors vindication langbaine calls his plays second rate performances but the wits of his time would not permit them to rank so high he was according to his own confession one of the most voluminous writers that ever attempted dramatic poetry in any language and none but the celebrated spaniard lopez de vega can vie with him in his preface to one of his plays he observes that this tragicomedy is one preserved amongst two hundred and twenty in which i have had either an entire hand or at least a main finger of this prodigious number winstanley langbaine and jacob agree that twentyfour only remain the reason heywood himself gives is this that many of them by shifting and change of companies have been negligently lost others of them are still retained in the hands of some actors who think it against their profit to have them come in print and a third that it was never any great ambition in me to be voluminously read these seem to be more plausible reasons than winstanley gives for their miscarriage it is said that he not only acted himself every day but also wrote each day a sheet and that he might lose no time many of his plays were composed in the tavern on the backside of tavern bills which may be the occasion that so many of them are lost that many of our authors plays might be planned and perhaps partly composed in a tavern is very probable but that any part of them was wrote on a tavern bill seems incredible the tavern bill being seldom brought upon the table till the guests are going to depart besides as there is no account of heywoods being poor and when his employment is considered it is almost impossible he could have been so there is no necessity to suppose this very strange account to be true a poet not long dead was often obliged to study in the fields and write upon scraps of paper which he occasionally borrowed but his case was poverty and absolute want see the life of savage  langbaine observes of our author that he was a general scholar and a tolerable linguist as his several translations from lucian erasmus texert beza buchanan and other latin and italian authors sufficiently manifest nay further says he in several of his plays he has borrowed many ornaments from the ancients as more particularly in his play called the ages he has interspersed several things borrowed from homer virgil ovid seneca plautus which extremely set them off what opinion the wits of his age had of him may appear from the following verses extracted from of one of the poets of those times langbaine p      the squibbing middleton and heywood sage the apologetick atlas of the stage well of the golden age he could entreat but little of the metal he could get threescore sweet babes he fashioned at a lump for he was christened in parnassus pump the muses gossip to auroras bed and ever since that time his face was red   we have no account how much our author was distinguished as an actor and it may be reasonably conjectured that he did not shine in that light if he had his biographers would scarce have omitted so singular a circumstance besides he seems to have addicted himself too much to poetry to study the art of playing which they who are votaries of the muses or are favored by them seldom think worth their while and is indeed beneath their genius  the following is a particular account of our authors plays now extant   robert earl of huntingdons downfall an historical play   0  acted by the earl of nottinghams

volume under the title of works as others by which he would seem tacitly to arraign some of his cotemporaries for ostentation and want of modesty langbaine is of opinion that heywood in this case levelled the accusation at ben johnson since no other poet in those days gave his plays the pompous title of works of which sir john suckling has taken notice in his session of the poets the first that broke silence was good old ben prepared before with canary wine and he told them plainly that he deserved the bays for his were called works where others were but plays there was also a distich

beginning of december      how long he remained at the university wood is not able to determine in the year    0 he began a long journey and after he had traveled through several parts of europe he visited many cities especially constantinople and countries under the turkish empire as greece egypt and the holy land athen oxon p    vol ii  afterward he took a view of the remote parts of italy and the islands adjoining then he went to rome the antiquities of that place were shown him by nicholas fitzherbert once an oxford student and who had the honor of mr sandyss acquaintance thence our author went to venice and from that returned to england where digesting his notes he published his travels sandys who appears to have been a man of excellent parts of a pious and generous disposition did not like too many travelers turn his attention upon the modes of dress and the fashions of the several courts which is but a poor acquisition but he studied the genius the tempers the religion and the governing principles of the people he visited as much as his time amongst them would permit he returned in      being improved says wood in several respects by this his large journey being an accomplished gentleman as being master of several languages of affluent and ready discourse and excellent comportment he had also a poetical fancy and a zealous inclination to all literature which made his company acceptable to the most virtuous men and scholars of his time he also wrote a paraphrase on the psalms of david and upon the hymns dispersed throughout the old and new testament london      reprinted there in folio      with other things under this title  paraphrase on the divine poems on job psalms of david ecclesiastes lamentations of jeremiah and songs collected out of the old

christs passion written in latin by the famous hugo grotius and translated by our author to which he also added notes this subject had been handled before in greek by that venerable person apollinarius of laodicea bishop of hierapolis but this of grotius in sandyss opinion transcends all on this argument this piece was reprinted with figures in  vo london      concerning our author but few incidents are known he is celebrated by cotemporary and subsequent wits as a very considerable poet and all have agreed to bestow upon him the character of a pious worthy man he died in the year      at the house of his nephew mr wiat at boxley abbey in kent in the chancel of which parish church he is buried though without a monument only as wood says with the following which stands in the common register belonging to this church georgius sandys poetarum anglorum sui saeculi princeps sepultus fuit martii  o stilo anglico anno dom      it would be injurious to the memory of sandys to dismiss his life without informing the reader that the worthy author stood high in the opinion of that most accomplished young nobleman the lord viscount falkland by whom to be praised is the highest compliment that can be paid to merit his lordship addresses a copy of verses to grotius occasioned by his christus patiens in which he introduces mr sandys and says of him that he had seen as much as grotius had read he bestows upon him likewise the epithet of a fine gentleman and observes that though he had traveled to foreign countries to read life and acquire knowledge yet he was worthy like another livy of having men of eminence from every country come to visit him from the quotation here given it will be seen that sandys was a smooth versifier and dryden in his preface to his translation of virgil positively says that had mr sandys gone before him in the whole translation he would by no means have attempted it after him  in the translation of his christus patiens in the chorus of act iii jesus speaks daughters of solyma no more my wrongs thus passionately deplore these tears for future sorrows keep wives for yourselves and children weep that horrid day will shortly come when you shall bless the barren womb and breast that never infant fed then shall you wish the mountains head would from this trembling basis slide and all in tombs of ruin hide   in his

athen oxon vol i col      for some years he received his education in ireland where his father carried him when he was appointed lord deputy of that kingdom in      he had his academical learning in trinity college in dublin and in st johns college cambridge clarendon relates that before he came to be twenty years of age he was master of a noble fortune which descended to him by the gift of a grandfather without passing through his father or mother who were both alive shortly after that and before he was of age being in his inclination a great lover of the military life he went into the low countries in order to procure a command and to give himself up to it but was diverted from it by the complete inactivity of that summer he returned to england and applied himself to a severe course of study first to polite literature and poetry in which he made several successful attempts in a very short time he became perfectly master of the greek tongue accurately read all the greek historians and before he was twenty three years of age he had perused all the greek and latin fathers  about the time of his fathers death in      he was made one of the gentlemen of his majestys privy chamber notwithstanding which he frequently retired to oxford to enjoy the conversation of learned and ingenious men in      he was engaged in an expedition against the scots and though he received some disappointment in a command of a troop of horse of which he had a promise he went a volunteer with the earl of essex clarendons history etc   in    0 he was chosen a member of the house of commons for newport in the isle of wight in the parliament which began at westminster the   th of april in the same year and from the debates says clarendon which were managed with all imaginable gravity and sobriety he contracted such a reverence for parliaments that he thought it absolutely impossible they ever could produce mischief or inconvenience to the nation or that the kingdom could be tolerably happy in the intermission of them and from the unhappy and unseasonable dissolution of the parliament he harbored some prejudice to the court  in      john lord finch keeper of the great seal was impeached by lord falkland in the name of the house of commons and his lordship says clarendon managed that prosecution with great vigor and sharpness as also against the earl of strafford contrary to his natural gentleness of temper but in both these cases he was misled by the authority of those whom he believed understood the laws perfectly of which he himself was utterly ignorant ibid   he had contracted an aversion toward archbishop laud and some other bishops which inclined him to concur in the first bill to take away the votes of the bishops in the house of lords the reason of his prejudice against laud was the extraordinary passion and impatience of contradiction discoverable in that proud prelate who could not command his temper even at the council table when his majesty was present but seemed to lord it over all the rest not by the force of argument but an assumed superiority to which he had no right this nettled lord falkland and made him exert his spirit to humble and oppose the supercilious churchman this conduct of his lordships gave mr hampden occasion to court him to his party who was justly placed by the brilliance of his powers at the head of the oppositon but after a longer study of the laws of the realm and conversation with the celebrated edward hyde earl of clarendon he changed his opinion and espoused an interest quite opposite to hampdens  after much importunity he at last accepted the seals of his majesty and served in that employment with unshaken integrity being above corruption of any kind  when he was vested with that high dignity two parts of his conduct were very remarkable he could never persuade himself that it was lawful to employ spies or give any countenance or entertainment to such persons who by a communication of guilt or dissimulation of manners wind themselves into such trusts and secrets as enable them to make discoveries neither could he ever suffer himself to open letters upon a suspicion that they might contain matters of dangerous consequence and proper for statesmen to know as to the first he condemned them as void of all honor and who ought justly to be abandoned to infamy and that no single preservation could be worth so general a wound and corruption of socity as encouraging such people would carry with it the last he thought such a violation of the law of nature that no qualification by office could justify him in the trespass and though the necessity of the times made it clear that those advantages were not to be declined and were necessary to be practiced yet he found means to put it off from himself clarendon ubi supra   june         he was one of the lords who signed the declaration wherein they professed they were fully satisfied his majesty had no intention to raise war upon his parliament at the same time he subscribed to levy twenty horse for his majestys service upon which he was excepted from the parliaments favor in the instructions given by the two houses to their general the earl of essex he attended the king to edgehill fight where after the enemy was routed he was exposed to imminent danger by endeavoring to save those who had thrown away their arms he was also with his majesty at oxford and during his residence there the king went one day to see the public library where he was showed among other books a virgil nobly printed and exquisitely bound the lord falkland to divert the king would have him make a trial of his fortune by the sorts virgilianae an usual kind of divination in ages past made by opening a virgil whereupon the king opening the book the period which happened to come up was that part of didos imprecation against aeneas aeneid lib   v     part of which is thus translated by mr dryden oppressed with numbers in the unequal field his men discouraged and himself expelled let him for succor sue from place to place torn from his subjects and his sons embrace   his majesty seemed much concerned at this accident lord falkland who observed it would likewise try his own fortune in the same manner hoping he might fall upon some passage that had no relation to his case and thereby divert the kings thoughts from any impression the other might make upon him but the place lord falkland opened was more suited to his destiny than the other had been to the kings being the following expressions of evander on the untimely death of his son pallas aeneid b    verse     etc non haec o palla dederas promissa parenti etc   thus translated by mr dryden o pallas thou have failed thy plighted word to fight with caution not to tempt the sword i warned thee but in vain for well i knew what perils youthful ardour would pursue that boiling blood would carry thee too far young as thou were to dangers raw to war o cursed essay of arms disastrous doom prelude of bloody fields and fights to come memoirs etc by welwood edit        mo p  0      upon the beginning of the civil war his natural cheerfulness and vivacity was clouded and a kind of sadness and dejection of spirit stole upon him after the resolution of the two houses not to admit any treaty of peace those indispositions which had before touched him grew into a abit of gloominess and he who had been easy and affable to all men became on a sudden less communicable sad and extremely affected with the spleen in his dress to which he had formerly paid an attention beyond what might have been expected from a man of so great ablities and so much business he became negligent and slovenly and in his reception of suitors so quick sharp and severe that he was looked upon as proud and imperious  when there was any hope of peace his former spirit used to return and he appeared gay and vigorous and exceeding sollicitous to press any thing that might promote it and clarendon observes that after a deep silence when he was sitting amongst his friends he would with a shrill voice and sad accent repeat the words peace peace and would passionately say that the agony of the war the ruin and bloodshed in which he saw the nation involved took his sleep from him and would soon break his heart  this extreme uneasiness seems to have hurried him on to his destruction for the morning before the battle of newbery he called for a clean shirt and being asked the reason of it answered that if he were slain in the battle they should not find his body in foul linen being persuaded by his friends not to go into the fight as being no military officer he said he was weary of the times foresaw much misery to his country and did believe he should be out of it ere night putting himself therefore into the first rank of the lord byrons regiment he was shot with a musket in the lower part of his belly on the  0th of september      and in the instant falling from his horse his body was not found till next morning  thus died in the bed of honor the incomparable lord falkland on whom all his contemporaries bestowed the most lavish encomiums and very deservedly raised altars of praise to his memory among all his panegyrist clarendon is the foremost and of highest authority and in his words therefore i shall give his character to the reader in this unhappy battle says he was slain the lord viscount falkland a person of such prodigious parts of learning and knowledge of that inimitable sweetness and delight in conversation and so flowing and obliging a humanity and goodness to mankind and of that primitive simplicity and integrity of life that if there were no other brand upon this odious and accursed civil war than that single loss it must be most infamous and execrable to all posterity he was a great cherisher of wit and fancy and good parts in any man and if he found them clouded with poverty and want a most liberal and bountiful patron toward them even above his fortune his lordship then enumerates the unshaken loyalty and great abilities of this young hero in the warmth of a friend he shows him in the most engaging light and of all characters which in the course of this work we met with except sir philip sidneys lord falkands seems to be the most amiable and his virtues are confessed by his enemies of the opposite faction the noble historian in his usual masterly manner thus concludes his panegyric on his deceased friend he fell in the   th year of his age having so much dispatched the true business of life that the eldest rarely attain to that immense knowledge and the youngest enter into the world with more innocence whosoever leads such a life needs be less anxious upon how short warning it is taken from him  as to his person he was little and of no great strength his hair was blackish and somewhat flaggy and his eyes black and lively his body was buried in the church of great

holland a cambridge scholar and afterward a romish prist having written an answer to this discourse of the infallibility the lord falkland made a reply to it entitled   a view of some exceptions made against the discourse of the infallibility of the church of rome printed at oxford       to he assisted mr chillingworth in his book of the religion of the protestants etc this particular we learn from bishop barlow in his genuine remains who says that when mr chillingworth undertook the defense of dr pottuss book against the jesuit he was almost continually at tew with my lord examining the reasons of both parties pro and con and their invalidity and consequence where mr chillingworth had the benefit of my lords company and of his good library   we shall present our readers with a specimen of his lordships poetry in a copy of verses addressed to grotius on his christus patiens a tragedy translated by mr sandys to the author our ages wonder by thy birth the fame of belgia by thy banishment the shame who to more knowledge younger did arrive than forward glaucia yet art still alive whose masters often for suddenly you grew to equal and pass those and need no new to see how soon how far thy wit could reach sat down to wonder when they came to teach often then would scaliger contented be to leave to mend all times to polish thee and of that pains effect did higher boast than had he gained all that his fathers lost when thy capella read  that king of critics stood amazed to see a work so like his own set forth by thee   sir john suckling lived in the reign of king charles i and was son of sir john suckling comptroller of the household to that monarch he was born at witham in the county of middlesex      with a remarkable circumstance of his mothers going eleven months with him which naturalists look upon as portending a hardy and vigorous constitution a strange circumstance is related of him in his early years in a life prefixed to his works he spoke latin says the author at five years old and wrote it at nine if either of these circumstances is true it would seem as if he had learned latin from his nurse nor ever heard any other language so that it was native to him but to speak latin at five in consequence of study is almost impossible  the polite arts which our author chiefly admired were music and poetry how far he excelled in the former cannot be known nor can we agree with his lifewriter already mentioned that he excelled in both sir john suckling seems to have been no poet nor to have had even the most distant appearances of it his lines are generally so unmusical that none can read them without grating their ears being author of several plays he may indeed be called a dramatist and consequently comes within our design but as he is destitute of poetical conceptions as well as the power of numbers he has no pretensions to rank among the good poets  dryden somewhere calls him a sprightly wit a courtly writer in this sense he is what mr dryden styles him but then he is no poet notwithstanding his letters which are published along with his plays are exceeding courtly his style easy and genteel and his thoughts natural and in reading his letters one would wonder that the same man who could write so elegantly in prose should not better succeed in verse  after suckling had made himself acquainted with the constitution of his own country and taken a survey of the most remarkable things at home he traveled to digest and enlarge his notions from a view of other countries where says the abovementioned author he made a collection of their virtues without any tincture of their vices and follies only that some were of opinion he copied the french air too much which being disagreeable to his father who was remarkable for his gravity and indeed inconsistent with the gloominess of the times he was reproached for it and it was imputed to him as the effects of his travels but some were of opinion that it was more natural than acquired the easiness of his manner and address being suitable to the openness of his heart the gaiety wit and gallantry which were so conspicuous in him and he seems to have valued himself upon nothing more than the character of the courtier and the fine gentleman which he so far attained that he is allowed to have had the peculiar happiness of making every thing he did become him while suckling was thus assiduous about acquiring the reputation of a finished courtier and a man of fashion it is no wonder that he neglected the higher excellencies of genius for a poet and a beau never yet were united in one person  sir john was not however so much devoted to the luxury of the court as to be wholly a stranger to the field in his travels he made a campaign under the great gustavus adolphus where he was present at three battles and five sieges besides other sirmishes between parties and from such a considerable scene of action gained as much experience in six months as otherwise he would have done in as many years  after his return to england the civil war being then raging he raised a troop of horse for the kings service entirely at his own charge so richly and completely mounted that it stood him in   00 l but his zeal for his majesty did not meet with the success it deserved which very much affected him and soon after this he was seized with a fever and died in the   th year of his age in which short space he had done enough to procure him the esteem of the politest men who conversed with him but as he had set out in the world with all the advantages o  person education and fortune peoples expectations of him were raised to too great a height which seldom fails to issue in a disappointment he makes no figure in the history of these times perhaps from the immaturity of his death which prevented him from action this might be one reason for his being neglected in the annals of the civil war another might be his unnecessary or rather ridiculous show of finery which he affected in decorating his troop of horse this could not fail to draw down contempt upon him for in time of public distress nothing can be more foolish than to wear the livery of prosperity and surely an army would have no great reason to put much confidence in the conduct or courage of that general who in the morning of a battle should be found in his tent persuming his hair or arraying himself in embroidery  mr lloyd in his memoirs of our author observes that his thoughts were not so loose as his expressions nor his life so vain as his thoughts and at the same time makes an allowance for his youth and sanguine complexion which says he a little more time and experience would have corrected of this we have instances in his occasional discourses about religion to my lord dorset to whom he was related and in his thoughts of the posture of affairs in both which he has discovered that he could think as coolly and reason as justly as men of more years and less fire  to a lady that forbad to love before company what no more favors not a ribbon more not fan nor muff to hold as heretofore must all the little blesses then be left and what was once loves gift become our theft may we not look ourselves into a trance teach our souls parley at our eyes not glance nor touch the hand but by soft wringing there whisper a love that only yes can hear not free a sigh a sigh that is there for you dear must i love you and not love you too be wise nice fair for sooner shall they trace the feathered choiristers from place to place by prints they make in the air and sooner say by what right line the last star made its way that fled from heaven to earth than guess to know how our loves first did spring or how they grow the above are as smooth lines as could be found among our authors works but in justice to suckling before we give an account of his plays we shall transcribe one of his letters when we are persuaded the reader will join in the opinion already given of his works in general it is addressed to his mistress and has something in it gay and sprightly  this verifies the opinion of mr dryden that love makes a man a rhimster if not a poet  my dear dear think i have kissed your letter to nothing and now know not what to answer or that now i am answering i am kissing you to nothing and know not how to go on for you must pardon i must hate all i send you here because it expresses nothing in respect of what it leaves behind with me and oh why should i write then why should i not come myself those tyrants business honor and necessity what have they to do with with you and me why should we not do loves commands before theirs whose sovereignty is but usurped upon us shall we not smell to roses cause others do look on or gather them because there are prickles or something that would hinder us  dear  i fain would and know no hindrance  but what must come from you  and  why should any come since it is not i but you must be sensible how much time we lose it being long since i was not myself  but   yours    his dramatic works are   aglaura presented at a private house in black friars langbaine says that it was much prized in his time

rutlandshire and according to wood in his fasti oxon was at length made rector of hadham in hertfordshire upon the breaking out of the civil wars he was made chaplain to spencer earl of northampton to whom he adhered in all his engagements for the royal interest and was with him in the castle of banbury in oxfordshire when it was vigorously defended against the parliaments frces in that castle mr wood says he concluded his last moments in the year      and was buried within the precincts of it or else in the church belonging to banbury  this person whom both langbaine and wood account a very ingenious man and an excellent poet has written the following pieces rival friends a comedy acted before the king and queen when their majestys paid a visit to the university of cambridge upon the

being much delighted with it     this author also translated into english hymnus tobaci etc land       vo  william drummond of hawthornden esquire this gentleman was a native of scotland and a poet of no inconsiderable rank we had at first some doubt whether he fell within our design as being no englishman but upon observing that mr langbaine has given a place to the earl of stirling a man of much inferior note and that our author though a scotchman wrote extremely pure and elegant english and his life that is fruitful of a great many incidents without further apology it is here presented to the reader  he was born the   th of november      his father was sir john drummond of hawthornden who was gentleman usher to king james vi but did not enjoy that place long being in three months after he was raised to his new dignity taken away by death the reader will please to observe that i have taken the most material part of this account of mr drummond from a life of him prefixed to a  to edition printed at edinburgh       the family of drummond in the arcle of antiquity is inferior to none in scotland where that kind of distinction is very much regarded  the first years of our authors youth were spent at the high school at edinburgh where the early promises of that extraordinary genius which afterward appeared in him became very conspicuous he was in due time sent to the university of edinburgh where after the ordinary stay he was made master of arts when his course at the university was finished he did not like the greatest part of giddy students give over reading and vainly imagine they have a sufficient stock of learning he had too much sense thus to deceive himself he knew that an education at the university is but the groundwork of knowledge and that unless a man digests what he has there learned and endeavors to produce it into life with advantage so many years attendance were but entirely thrown away being convinced of this truth he continued to read the best authors of antiquity whom he not only retained in his memory but so digested that he became quite master of them and able to make such observations on their genius and writings as fully showed that his judgment had been sufficiently exercised in reading them  in the year   0  his father sent him into france he being then only twentyone years old he studied at bourges the civil law with great diligence and applause and was master not only of the dictates of the professors but made also his own observations on them which occasioned the learned president lockhart to observe that if mr drummond had followed the practice he might have made the best figure of any lawyer in his time but like all other men of wit he saw more charms in euripides sophocles seneca and other the illustrious ancients than in the dry wranglings of the law as there have been often instances of poets and men of genius being educated to the law so here it may not be amiss to observe that we remember not to have met with one amongst them who continued in that profession a circumstance not much in its favor and is a kind of proof that the professors of it are generally composed of men who are capable of application but without genius mr drummond having as we have already observed a sovereign contempt for the law applied himself to the sublimer studies of poetry and history in both which he became very eminent  having relinquished all thoughts of the bar or appearing in public he retired to his pleasant seat at hawthorden and there by reading the greek and latin authors enriched the world with the product of his solitary hours after he had recovered a very dangerous fit of sickness he wrote his cypress grove a piece of excellent prose both for the fineness of the style and the sublimity and piety of the sentiments in which he represents the vanity and instability of human affairs teaches a due contempt of the world proposes consolations against the fear of death and gives us a view of eternal happiness much about this time he wrote the flowers of sion in verse though the numbers in which these poems are wrote are not now very fashionable yet the harmony is excellent and during the reign of king james and charles i we have met with no poet who seems to have had a better ear or felt more intimately the passion he describes the writer of his life already mentioned observes that notwithstanding his close retirement love stole upon him and entirely subdued his heart he needed not to have assigned retirement as a reason why it should seem strange that love grew upon him sor retirement in its own nature is the very parent of love when a man converses with but few ladies he is apt to fall in love with her who charms him most whereas were his attention dissipated and his affections bewildered by variety he would be preserved from love by not being able to fix them which is one reason why we always find people in the country have more enthusiastic notions of love than those who move in the hurry of lie this beautiful young lady with whom mr drummond was enamoured was daughter of mr cunningham of barnes of an ancient and honorable family he made his addresses to her in the true spirit of gallantry and as he was a gentleman who had seen the world and consequently was accomplished in the elegancies of life he was not long in exciting proper returns of passion he gained her affections and when the day of the marriage was appointed and all things ready for its solemnization she was seized with a fever and snatched from him when his imagination had figured those scenes of rapture which naturally fill the mind of a bridegroom as our author was a poet he no doubt was capable of forming still a greater ideal fealt than a man of ordinary genius and as his mistress was as row expresses it more than painting can express or youthful poets fancy when they love those who have felt that delicate passion may be able in some measure to judge of the severity of distress into which our poetical bridegroom was now plunged after the fervours of sorrow had in some measure subsided he expressed his grief for her in several letters and poems and with more passion and sincerity celebrated his dead mistress than others praise their living ones this extraordinary shock occasioned by the young ladys death on whom he doated with such excessive fondness so affected his spirits that in order as much as possible to endeavor to forget her he quitted his retirement and resided eight years at paris and rome he traveled through germany france and italy where he visited all the famous universities conversed with the learned men and made an excellent collection of the best ancient greek and of the modern spanish french and italian books mr drummond though a scholar and a man of genius did not think it beneath him to improve himself in those gay accomplishments which are so peculiar to the french and which never fail to set off wit and parts to the best advantage he studied music and is reported to have possessed the genteel accomplishment of dancing to no inconsiderable degree  after a long stay of eight years abroad he returned again to his native country where a civil war was ready to break out he then found that as he could be of no service by his action he might at least by his retirement and during the confusion he went to the seat of his brotherinlaw sir john scott of scotts tarvat a man of learning and good sense in this interval it is supposed he wrote his history of the five jamess successively kings of scotland which is so excellent a work whether we consider the exact conduct of the story the judicious reflections and the fine language that no historian either of the english or scotch nation the lord clarendon excepted has shown a happier talent for that species of writing which though it does not demand the highest genius yet is as difficult to attain as any other kind of literary excellence this work was received in england with as much applause as if it had been written by a countryman of their own and about english affairs it was first published six or seven years after the authors death with a preface or introduction by mr hall of grays inn who though not much disposed to think favorably of the scotch nation has yet thus done justice to mr drummond for his manner of vting says he though he treats of things that are rather many than great and rather troublesome than glorious yet he has brought so much of the main together as it may be modestly said none of that nation has done before him and for his way of handling it he has sufficiently made it appear how conversant he was with the writings of venerable antiquity and how generously he has emulated them by a happy imitation for the purity of that language is much above the dialect he wrote in his descriptions lively and full his narrations clear and pertinent his orations eloquent and fit for the persons who speak and his reflections solid and mature so that it cannot be expected that these leaves can be turned over without as much pleasure as profit especially meeting with so many glories and trophies of our ancestors in this history mr drummond has chiefly followed bishop elphiston and has given a different turn to things from buchanan whom a party of the scotch accuse of being a pensioner of queen elizabeths and as he joined interest with the earl of murray who wanted to disturb the reign of his much injured sister mary queen of scots he is strongly suspected of being a party writer and of having misrepresented the scotch transactions of old in order to serve some scheme of policy  in the short notes which mr drummond has left behind him in his own life he says that he was the first in the island that ever celebrated a dead mistres his poems consist chiefly of loveverses madigrals epigrams epitaphs etc they were highly esteemed by his contemporaries both for the wit and learning that shone in them edward philips miltons nephew writes a preface to them and observes that his poems are the effects of genius the most polite and verdant that ever the scots nation produced and says that if he should affirm that neither tasso guarini or any of the most neat and refined spirits of italy nor even the choicest of our english poets can chalienge any advantage above him it could not be judged any attribute superior to what he deserves and for his history he says had there been nothing else extant of his writings consider but the language how florid and ornate it is consider the order and prudent conduct of the story and you will rank him in the number of the best writers and compare him even with thuanus himself neither is he less happy in his verse than prose for here are all those graces met together that conduce any thing toward the making up a complete and perfect poet a decent and becoming majesty a brave and admirable height and a wit flowing thus far the testimony of mr philips  in order to divert himself and his friends he wrote a small poem which he called polemiomiddinia it is a sort of macronic poetry in which the scots words are put in latin terminations in queen annes time it was reprinted at oxford with a preface concerning macronic poetry it has been often reprinted in scotland where it is thought a very humorous performance  our author who we have already seen suffered so much by the immature fate of his first mistress thought no more of love for many years after her decease but seeing by accident one elizabeth logan grandchild to sir robert logan who by the great resemblance she bore to his first favorite rekindled again the flame of love she was beautiful in his eyes because she recalled to his mind the dear image of her he mourned and by this lucky similarity she captivated him though he was near    years of age he married this lady she bore to him several children william who was knighted in charles iis time robert and elizabeth who was married to one dr henderson a physician at edinburgh  in the time of the public troubles mr drummond besides composing his history wrote several tracts against the measures of the covenanters and those engaged in the opposition of charles i in a piece of his called irene he harangues the king nobility gentry clergy and commons about their mutual mistakes jealousies and fears he lays before them the dismal consequences of a civil war from indisputable arguments and the histories of past times the great marquis of montrose writ a letter to him desiring him to print this irene as the best means to quiet the minds of the distracted people he likewise sent him a protection dated august      immediately after the battle of kylsyth with another letter in which he highly commends mr drummonds learning and loyalty besides this work of irene he wrote the load star and an address to the noblemen barons gentlemen etc who leagued themselves for the defense of the liberties and religion of scotland the whole purport of which is to calm the disturbed minds of the populace to reason the better sort into loyalty and to check the growing evils which he saw would be the consequence of their behavior those of his own countrymen for whom he had the greatest esteem were sir william alexander afterward earl of stirling sir robert carr afterward earl of ancram from whom the present marquis of lothian is descended dr arthur johnston physician to king charles i and author of a latin paraphrase of the psalms and mr john adamson principal of the college of edinburgh he had great intimacy and correspondence with the two famous english poets michael drayton and ben johnson the latter of whom traveled from london on foot to see him at his seat at hawthornden during the time ben remained with mr drummond they often held conversation about poetry and poets and mr drummond has preserved the heads of what passed between them and as part of it is very curious and serves to illustrate the character of johnson we have inserted it in his life though it perhaps was not altogether fair in mr drummond to commit to writing things that passed over a bottle and which perhaps were heedlesly advanced it is certain some of the particulars which mr drummond has preserved are not much in bens favor and as few people are so wise as not to speak imprudently sometimes so it is not the part of a man who invites another to his table to expose what may there drop inadvertently but as mr drummond had only made memorandums perhaps with no resolution to publish them he may stand acquitted of part of this charge it is reported of our author that he was very smart and witty in his repartecs and had a most excellent talent at extempore versifying above any pot of his time in the year      when the plague was raging in scotland our author came accidentally to forfar but was not allowed to enter any house or to get lodging in the town though it was very late he went two miles surther to kirrimeir where he was well received and kindly entertained being informed that the towns of forfar and kirrimuir had a contest about a piece of ground called the muirmoss he wrote a letter to the provost of forfar to be communicated to the towncouncil in haste it was imagined this letter came from the estates who were then sitting at st andrews so the common council was called with all expedition and the minister sent for to pray for direction and assistance in answering the letter which was opened in a solemn manner it contained the following lines the kirrimorians and forsorians met at muirmoss the kirrimorians beat the forforians back to the cross shoemakers suitors ye are and suitors yell be t  y upon forfar kirrimuir bears the gree   by this innocent piece of mirth he revenged himself on the town of forfar as our author was a great cavalier and addicted to the kings party he was forced by the reformers to send men to the army which fought against the king and his estate lying in three different counties he had not occasion to send one entire man but halves and quarters and such like fractions that is the money levied upon him as his share did not amount to the maintaining one man but perhaps half as much and so on through the several counties where his estates lay upon this he wrote the following verses to the king of all these forces raised against the king it is my strange hap not one whole man to bring from diverse parishes yet diverse men but all in halves and quarters great king then in halves and quarters if they come against thee in halves and quarters send them back to me   being reputed a malignant he was extremely harrassed by the prevailing party and for his verses and discourses frequently summoned before their circular tables in the short account of his life written by himself he says that he never endeavored to advance his fortune or increase such things as were left him by his parents as he foresaw the uncertainty and shortness of life and thought this worlds advantages not worth struggling for the year      remarkable for the beheading of charles i put likewise a period to the life of our author upon hearing the dismal news that his sovereigns blood was shed on a scaffold he was so overwhelmed with grief and being worn down with study he could not overcome the shock and though we find not that he ever was in arms for the king yet he may be said in some sense to have fallen a sacrifice to his loyalty he was a man of fine natural endowments which were cultivated by reading and traveling he spoke the italian spanish and french languages as well as his mother tongue he was a judicious and great historian a delicate poet a master of polite erudition a loyal subject a friend to his country and to sum up all a pious christian  before his works are prefixed several copies of verses in his praise with which we shall not trouble the reader but conclude the life of this great man with the following sonnet from his works as a specimen of the delicacy of his muse i know that all beneath the moon decays and what by mortals in this world is brought in times great period shall return to naught that fairest states have fatal nights and days i know that all the muses heavenly lays with toil of spirit which are so dearly bough as idle sounds of few or none are sought that there is nothing lighter than vair praise i know frail beauty like the purple flower to which one morn often birth and death affords that love a jarring is of minds accords where sense and will bring under reasons power know what i list all this cannot me move but that alas i both must write and love   william alexander earl of stirling it is agreed by the antiquaries of scotland where this nobleman was born that his family was originally a branch of the macdonalds alexander macdonald their ancestor obtained from the family of argyle a grant of the lands of menstry in clackmananshire where they fixed their residence and took their sirnames from the christian name of their predecessor crawfords peerage of scotland  our author was born in the reign of queen elizabeth and during the minority of james vi of scotland but on what year cannot be ascertained he gave early discoveries of a rising genius and much improved the fine parts he had from nature by a very polite and extensive education he first traveled abroad as tutor to the earl of argyle and was a considerable time with that nobleman while they visited foreign countries after his return being happy in so great a patron as the earl of argyle and finished in all the courtly accomplishments he was caressed by persons of the first fashion while he yet moved in the sphere of a private gentleman  mr alexander having a strong propensity to poetry he declined entering upon any public employment for some years and dedicated all his time to the reading of the ancient poets upon which he formed his taste and whose various graces he seems to have understood king james of scotland who with but few regal qualities yet certainly had a propension to literature and was an encourager of learned men took mr alexander early into his favor he accepted the poems our author presented him with the most condescending marks of esteem and was so warm in his interest that in the year      he created him a knight and by a kind of compulsion obliged him to accept the place of master of the requests crawford ubi supra  but the kings bounty did not stop here our author having settled a colony in nova scotia in america at his own expense james made him a grant of it by his royal deed on the   st of september      and intended to have erected the order of baronet for encouraging and advancing so good a work but the three last years of that princes reign being rendered troublesome to him by reason of the jealousies and commotions which then subsisted in england he thought fit to suspend the further prosecution of that affair till a more favorable crisis which he lived not to see  as soon as king charles i ascended the throne who inherited from his father the warmest affection for his native country he endeavored to promote that design which was likely to produce so great a benefit to the nation and therefore created sir william alexander lord lieutenant of new scotland and instituted the order of knight baronet for the encouraging and advancing that colony and gave him the power of coining small copper money a privilege which some discontented british subjects complained of with great bitterness but his majesty who had the highest opinion of the integrity and abilities of sir william did not on that account withdraw his favor from him but rather increased it for in the year      he made him secretary of state for scotch affairs in place of the earl of haddington and a peer by the title of viscount stirling and soon after raised him to the dignity of an earl by letters patent dated june         upon the solemnity of his majestys coronation at the palace of holyroodhouse in edinburgh his lordship enjoyed the place of secretary with the most unblemished reputation for the space of fifteen years even to his death which happened on the   th of february    0  our author married the daughter of sir william erskine baronet cousin german to the earl of mar then regent of scotland by her he had one son who died his majestys resident in nova scotia in the life time of his father and left behind him a son who succeeded his grandfather in the title of earl of stirling  his lordship is author of four plays which he styles monarchic tragedies viz the alexandraean tragedy craesus darius and julius caesar all which in the opinion of the ingenious mr coxeter whose indefatigable industry in collecting materials for this work which he lived not to publish has furnished the present biographers with many circumstances they could not otherwise have known were written in his lordships youth and before he undertook any state employment  these plays are written upon the model of the ancients as appears by his introducing the chorus between the acts they are grave and sententious throughout like the tragedies of seneca and yet the softer and tender passions are sometimes very delicately touched the author has been very unhappy in the choice of his verse which is alternate like the quatrains of the french poet pibrach or sir william davenants heroic poem called gondibert which kind of verse is certainly unnatural for tragedy as it is so much removed from prose and cannot have that beautiful simplicity that tender pathos which is indispensible to the language of tragedy mr rymer has criticized with great judgment on this error of our author and shown the extreme absurdity of writing plays in rhyme notwithstanding the great authority of dryden can be urged in its defense  writing plays upon the model of the ancients by introducing chorusses can be defended with as little force it is the nature of a tragedy to warm the heart rouse the passions and fire the imagination which can never be done while the story goes languidly on the soul cannot be agitated unless the business of the play rises gradually the scene be kept busy and leading characters active we cannot better illustrate this observation than by an example  one of the bst poets of the present age the ingenios mr mason of cambridge has not long ago published a tragedy upon the model of the ancients called elfrida the merit of this piece as a poem has been confessed by the general reading it has obtained it is full of beauties the language is perfectly poetical the sentiments chaste and the moral excellent there is nothing in our tongue can much exceed it in the flowery enchantments of poetry or the delicate flow of numbers but while we admire the poet we pay no regard to the character no passion is excited the heart is never moved nor is the readers curiosity ever raised to know the event want of passion and regard to character is the error of our present dramatic poets and it is a true observation made by a gentleman in an occasional prologue speaking of the wits from chares ii to our own times he says from bard to bard the frigid caution crept and declamation roared while passion slept   but to return to our authors plays  the alexandraean tragedy is built upon the differences about the succession that rose between alexanders captains after his decease he has borrowed many thoughts and translated whole speeches from seneca virgil etc in this play his lordship seems to mistake the very essence of the drama which consists in action for thee is scarce one action performed in view of the audience but several persons are introduced upon the stage who relate achievements done by themselves and others the two first acts are entirely foreign to the business of the play upon the whole it must be allowed that his lordship was a very good historian for the reader may learn from it a great deal of the affairs of greece and rome for the plot see quintus curtius the thirteenth book of justin diodorus siculus josephus raleighs history etc the scene is in babylon  craesus a tragedy the scene of this play is laid in sardis and is reckoned the most moving of the four it is chiefly borrowed from herodotus clio justin plutarchs life of solon salian torniel in the fifth act there is an episode of abradates and panthaea which the author has taken from xenophons cyropaedeia or the life and education of cyrus lib vii the ingenious scudery has likewise built upon this foundation in his diverting romance called the grand cyrus  darius a tragedy this was his lordships first dramatic performance it was printed at edinburgh in  to in the year   0  it was first composed of a mixture of english and scotch dialect and even then was commended by several copies of verses the scene of this play is laid in babylon the author afterward not only polished his native language but altered the play itself as to the plot consult q curtius diodorus siculus justin plutarchs life of alexander etc  julius caesar a tragedy in the fifth act of this play my lord brings brutus cassius cicero anthony etc together after the death of caesar almost in the same circumstances shakespeare has done in his play of this name but the difference between the anthony and brutus of shakespeare and these characters drawn by the earl of stirling is as great as the genius of the former transcended the latter this is the most regular of his lordships plays in the unity of action the story of this play is to be found in all the roman histories written since the death of that emperor  his lordship has acknowledged the style of his dramatic works not to be pre for which in excuse he has pleaded his country the scotch dialect then being in a very imperfect state having mentioned the scotch dialect it will not be improper to observe that it is at this time much in the same degree of perfection that the english language was in the reigns of henry viii and queen elizabeth there are idioms peculiar to the scotch which some of their best writers have not been able entirely to forget and unless they reside in england for some time they seldom overcome them and their language is greatly obscured by these means but the reputation which some scotch writers at present enjoy make it sufficiently clear that they are not much wanting in perspicuity or elegance of which mr hume the ingenious author of essays moral and political is an instance in the particular quality of fire which is indispensible in a good writer the scotch authors have rather too much of it and are more apt to be extravagantly animated than correctly dull  besides these plays our author wrote several other poems of a different kind viz doomsday or the great day of the lords judgment first printed      and a poem divided into    book which the author calls hours in this poem is the following emphatic line when speaking of the divine vengeance falling upon the wicked he calls it a weight of wrath more than ten worlds could bear   a very ingenious gentleman of oxford in a conversation with the author of this life took occasion to mention the above line as the best he had ever read consisting of monysyllables and is indeed one of the most affecting lines to be met with in any poet this poem says mr coxeter in his ms notes was reprinted in    0 by a johnston who in his preface says that he had the honor of transmitting the authors works to the great mr addison for the perusal of them and he was pleased to signify his approbation in these candid terms that he had read them with the greatest satisfaction and was pleased to give it as his judgment that the beauties of our ancient english poets are too slightly passed over by the modern writers who out of a peculiar singularity had rather take pains to find fault than endeavor to excel  a paraenaesis to prince henry who dying before it was published it was afterward dedicated to king charles i langbaine   jonathan intended to be an heroic poem but the first book of it is only extant he wrote all these poems in the ottavo rima of tasso or a stanza of eight lines six interwoven and a couplet in base his plays and poems were all printed together in folio under the title of recreations with the muses      and dedicated to the king  the earl of stirling lived in friendship with the most eminent wits of his time except ben johnson who complained that he was neglected by him but there are no particulars preserved concerning any quarrel between them  my lord seems to have often a peculiar inclination to punning but this was the characteristic vice of the times that he could sometimes write in a very elegant strain will appear by the following lines in which he describes love love is a joy which upon pain depends a drop of sweet drowned in a sea of sours what folly does begin that fury ends they hate for ever who have loved for hours   joseph hall bishop of norwich this prelate was born according to his own account july         in bristowpark within the parish of ashby de la zouch a town in leicestershire specialties of this bishops life prefixed to his works  his father was an officer under henry earl of huntingdon president of the north who from his infancy had devoted him to the service of the church and his mother whom he has celebrated for her exemplary and distinguished piety was extremely sollicitous that her favorite son should be of a profession she herself held so much in veneration our author who seems to have been very credulous in his disposition rather religious than wise or possessing any seize equal to the dignity to which he rose has preserved in his specialities some visions of his mothers which he relates with an air of seriousness sufficient to evidence his own conviction of their reality but as they appear to have been the offspring of a disordered imagination they have no right to a place here  in order to train him up to the ministry his father at first resolved to place him under the care of one mr pelset lately come from cambridge to be the public preacher at leicester who undertook to give him an education equally finished with that of the university and by these means save much expense to his father this resolution however was not executed some other friends advising his father to send him to cambridge and persuaded him that no private tuition could possibly be equal to that of the academical when our author had remained six years at cambridge he had a right to preferment and to stand for a fellowship had not his tutor mr giby been born in the same county with him and the statutes not permitting two of the same shire to enjoy fellowships and as mr gilby was senior to our author and already in possession mr hall could not be promoted in consequence of this he proposed to remove when the earl of huntingdon being made acquainted with this circumstance and hearing very favorable accounts of our author interested himself to prevent his removal he made application to mr gilby promised to make him his chaplain and promote him in the church provided he would relinquish his place in the college in favor of mr hall these promises being made with seeming sincerity and as the earl of huntingdon was a man of reputation for probity he complied with his lordships request and relinquished his place in the college when he was about to enter upon his office of chaplain to his great mortification the nobleman on whose promises he confided and on whom he immediately depended suddenly died by which accident he was thrown unprovided upon the world this not a little affected mr hall who was shocked to think that mr gilby should be thus distressed by the generosity of his temper which excited him to quit a certainty in order to make way for his promotion he addressed dr chadderton then the master of the college that the succeeding election might be stopped and that mr gilby should again possess his place but in this request he was unsuccessful for the doctor told him that mr gilby was divested of all possibilty of remedy and that they must proceed in the election the day following when mr hall was unanimously chosen into that society two years after this he was chosen rhetorician to the public schools where as he himself expresses it he was encouraged with a sufficient frequence of auditors but this place be soon resigned to dr dod and entered upon studies necessary to qualify him for taking orders  some time after this the mastership of a famous school erected at tiverton in devon became vacant this school was endowed by the founder mr blundel with a very large pension and the care of it was principally cast upon the then lord chief justice popham his lordship being intimately acquainted with dr chadderton requested him to recommend some learned and prudent man for the government of that school the dr recommended mr hall assuring him that great advantage would arise from it without much trouble to himself our author thinking proper to accept this the doctor carried him to london and introduced him to lord chief justice popham who seemed well pleased and thanked dr chadderton for recommending a man so well qualified for the charge when dr chadderton and mr hall had taken leave of his lordship and were returning to their lodgings a messenger presented a letter to mr hall from lady drury of suffolk earnestly requesting him to accept the rectory of halsted a place in her gift this flow of good fortune not a little surprised him and as he was governed by the maxims of prudence he made no long hesitation in accepting the latter which was both a better benefice and a higher preferment being settled at halsted he found there a dangerous antagonist to his ministry whom he calls in his specialities a witty and a bold atheist this was one mr lilly who by reason of his travels says he and abilities of discourse and behavior had so deeply insinuated himself into my patron that there were small hopes for me to work any good upon that noble patron of mine who by the suggestion of this wicked detractor was set off from me before he knew me hereupon i confess finding the obduredness and hopeless condition of that man i bent my prayers against him beseeching god daily that he would be pleased to remove by some means or other that apparent hindrance of my faithful labors who gave me an answer accordingly for this malicious man going hastily up to london to exasperate my patron against me was then and there swept away by the pestilence and never returned to do any further mischief this account given by mr hall of his antagonist reflects no great honor upon himself it is conceived in a spirit of bitterness and there is more of spite against lillys person in it than any tenderness or pity for his errors he calls him a witty atheist when in all probability what he terms atheism was no more than a freedom of thinking and facetious conversation which to the pious churchman had the appearance of denying the existence of god besides had hall dealt heartily he should have given his readers some more particulars of a man whom he was bold enough to denominate an atheist a character so very singular that it should never be imputed to any man without the strongest grounds hall in his usual spirit of enthusm in order to remove this antagonist of his has recourse to a  he tells us he went up to lndon and died of the plague which he would have us to understand was by the immediate  as if it were not ridiculous to  or author of so great importance as that the supeme being should work a miracle in his favor bu as it is with natural so is it with spiritua prid those who are possessed by either never fil to overrate their own significance and justly expose themselves to the contempt of the sober part of mankind  our author has also given us some accountof his marriage with the daughter of mr george winniff of bretenham he says of her that much modesty piety and good sposition were lodged in her seemly presence she was recommended to him by the rev mr grandig his friend and he says he listened to the recommendation as from the lord whom he frequently consulted by prayer before he entered into the matrimonial state she lived with him    yeas  not long after mr halls settlement at halsted he was solicited by sir edmund bacon to accompany him in a journey to the spain ardenna at the time when the earl of hrtford went ambassador to the archduke albert of brussels this request mr hall complied with as it furnished him with an opportunity of seeing more of the world and gratified a desire he had of conversing with the romish jesuits the particulars of his journey which he has preserved in his specialities are too trifling to be here inserted when he came to brussels he was introduced by an english gentleman who practiced physic there to the acquaintance of father costrus who held some conversation with him concerning the miracies said to be lately done by one lipsieus apricollis a woman who lived at zichem from particular miracles the father turned the discourse to the difference between divine and diabolical miracles and he told mr hall that if he could ascertain that one miracle ever was wrought in the church of england he would embrace that persuasion to which our author replied that he was fully convinced that many devils had been ejected out of persons in that church by fasting and prayer they both believed the possibility and frequency of miracles they only differed as to the church in which miracles were performed hall has censured father costrus as a barren man and of superficial conversation and it is to be feared that whoever reads halls religious works will conclude much in the same manner of him they departed from brussels soon after this interview between father costrus and our author and met with nothing in their journey to and return from the spa worth relation only mr hall had by his zeal in defending his own church exposed himself to the resentment of one signior ascanio negro who began notwithstanding mr halls layhabit to suspect him to be a clergyman and use some indecent freedoms with him in consequence of this suspicion our author to avoid any impertinence which the captain was likely to be guilty of toward him told him sir edmund bacon the person with whom he traveled was the grandchild of the great lord verulam high chancellor of england whose fame was extended to every country where science and philosophy prevailed and that they were protected by the earl of hertford the english ambassador at brussels upon the italians being made acquainted with the quality of sir edmund and the high connections of the two travelers he thought proper to desist from any acts of impertinence to which bigotry and ignorance would have excited him  hall returned to england after being absent eighteen months and was received but coldly by sir robert drury his patron there having never been much friendship between them in consequence of this mr hall came to london in search of a more comfortable provision he was soon recommended by one mr gurrey tutor to the earl of essex to preach before prince henry at richmond before this accident mr hall had been author of some meditations whom mr gurrey told him had been well received at henrys court and much read by that promising young prince he preached with success for the prince desired to hear him a second time and was so well pleased with him that he signified an inclination of having him attend about his court mr halls reputation growing he was taken notice of by persons of fashion and soon obtained the living of waltham presented him by the earl of norwich  while he exercised his function at waltham the archdeacon of norwich engaged him to interest himself in favor of the church of wolverhampton from which a patrimony was detained by a sacrilegious conveyance in the course of this prosecution our author observes that a mavelous light opened itself unexpectedly by revealing a counterseit seal in the manifestation of razures and interpolations and misdates of unjustifiable evidences that after many years suit lord chancellor ellesmere upon a full hearing gave a decree in savor of the church  during mr halls residence at waltham he was thrice employed by his majesty in public service his first public employment was to attend the earl of carlisle who went on an embassy to france and during his absence his majesty conferred upon him the deanery of worcester upon his return he attended the king in a journey to scotland where he exerted himself in support of episcopacy in opposition to the established ministry there who were presbyterians having acquired some name in polemical divinity and being long accustomed to disputations the king made choice of him to go to the netherlands and assist at the synod of dort in settling the controverted points of faith for which that reverend body were there convened hall has been very lavish in his own praise while he acted at the synod of dort he has given many hints of the supernatural assistance he was blessed with he has informed us that he was then in a languishing state of health that his rest was broken and his nights sleepless but on the night preceding the occasion of his preaching a latin sermon to the synod he was favored with refreshing sleep which he ascribes to the immediate care of providence the states of holland he says sent daniel heinsius the poet to visit him and were so much delighted with his comportment that they presented him with a rich medal of gold as a monument of their respect for his poor endeavors upon our authors returning home he found the church torn to pieces by the sierce contentions which then subsisted concerning the doctrines of arminius he saw this with concern and was sensible true religion piety and virtue could never be promoted by such altercation and therefore with the little power of which he was master he endeavored to effect a reconciliation between the contending parties he wrote what he calls a project of pacification which was presented to his majesty and would have had a very happy influence had not the enemies of mr hall misrepresented the book and so far influenced the king that a royal edict for a gene ral inhibition buried it in silence hall after this contended with the roman catholics who upon the prospect of the spanish match on the success of which they built their hopes began to betray a great degree of insolence and proudly boast the pedigree of their church from the apostles themselves they insisted that as their church was the first so it was the best and that no ordination was valid which was not derived from it hall in answer to their assertions made a concession which some of his protestant brethren thought he had no right to do he acknowledged the priority of the roman church but denied its infallibility and consequently that it was possible another church might be more pure and approach more to the apostolic practice than the romish this controversy he managed so successfully that he was promoted to the sea of exeter and as king james i seldom knew any bounds to his generosity when he happened to take a person into his favor he soon after that removed him from exeter and gave him the higher bishopric of norwich which he enjoyed not without some allay to his happiness for the civil wars soon breaking out he underwent the same severities which were exercised against other prelates of which he has given an account in a piece prefixed to his works called halls hard measure and from this we shall extract the most material circumstances  the insolence of some churchmen and the superiority they assumed in the civil government during the distractions of charles i provoked the house of commons to take some measures to prevent their growing power which that pious monarch was too much disposed to favor in consequence of this the leading members of the opposition petitioned the king to remove the bishops from their seats in parliament and degrade them to the station of commons which was warmly opposed by the high church lords and the bishops themselves who protested against whatever steps were taken during their restraint from parliament as illegal upon this principle that as they were part of the legislature no law could pass during their absence at least if that absence was produced by violence which clarendon has fully represented  the prejudice against the episcopal government gaining ground petitions to remove the bishops were poured in from all parts of the kingdom and as the earl of strafford was then so obnoxious to the popular resentment his cause and that of the bishops was reckoned by the vulgar synonimous and both felt the resentment of an enraged populace to such a fury were the common people wrought up that they came in bodies to the two houses of parliament to crave justice both against the earl of strafford and the archbishop of canterbury and in short the whole bench of spiritual peers the mob besieged the two houses and threatened vengeance upon the bishops whenever they came out this fury excited some motion to be made in the house of peers to prevent such tumults for the future which were sent down to the house of commons the bishops for their safety were obliged to continue in the parliament house the greatest part of the night and at last made their escape by byeways and stratagems they were then convinced that it was no longer safe for them to attend the parliament till some measures were taken to repress the insolence of the mob and in consequence of this they met at the house of the archbishop of york and drew up a protest against whatever steps should be taken during their absence occasioned by violence this protest the bishops intended should first be given to the secretary of state and by him to the king and that his majesty should cause it to be read in the house of peers but in place of this the bishops were accused of high treason brought before the bar of the house of peers and sent to the tower during their confinement their enemies in the house of commons took occasion to bring in a bill for taking away the votes of bishops in the house of peers in this bill lord falkland concurred and it was supported by mr hambden and mr pym the oracles of the house of commons but met with great opposition from edward hyde afterward earl of clarendon who was a friend to the church and could not bear to see their liberties infringed  the bishops petitioned to have council assigned them in which they were indulged in order to answer to the charge of high treason a day was appointed the bishops were brought to the bar but nothing was effected the house of commons at last finding that there could be no proof of high treason dropped that charge and were content to libel them for a misdemeanor in which they likewise but ill succeeded for the bishops were admitted to bail and no prosecution was carried on against them even for a misdemeanor  being now at liberty the greatest part of them retired to their dioceses till the storm which had threatened them should subside bishop hall repaired to norwich where he met from the disaffected party a very cold reception he continued preaching however in his cathedral at norwich till the order of sequestration came down when he was desired to remove from his palace while the sequestrators seized upon all his estate both real and personal and appraized all the goods which were in the palace the bishop relates the sollowing instance of oppression which was inflicted on him one morning says his lordship before my servants were up there came to my gates one wright a london trooper attended with others requiring entrance threatening if they were not admitted to break open the gates whom i found at first sight struggling with one of my servants for a pistol which he had in his hand i demanded his business at that unseasonable time he told me he came to search for arms and ammunition of which i must be disarmed i told him i had only two muskets in the house and no other military provision he not resting upon my word searched round about the house looked into the chests and trunks examined the vessels in the cellar finding no other warlike furniture he asked me what horses i had for his commission was to take them also i told him how poorly i was stored and that my age would not allow me to travel on soot in conclusion he took one horse away  the committee of sequestration soon after proceeded to strip him of all the revenue belonging to his see and as he refused to take the covenant the magistrates of the city of norwich who were no friends to episcopal jurisdiction cited him before them for giving ordination unwarrantably as they termed it to this extraordinary summons the bishop answered that he would not betray the dignity of his station by his personal appearance to answer any complaints before the lord mayor for as he was a peer of the realm no magistrate whatever had a right to take cognizance of his conduct and that he was only accountable to the house of lords of which he was one the bishop proceeds to enumerate the various insults he received from the enraged populace sometimes they searched his house for malignants at other times they threatened violence to his person nor did their resentment terminate here they exercised their fury in the cathedral tore down the altar broke the organ in pieces and committed a kind of sacrilegious devastation in the church they burnt the service books in the marketplace filled the cathedral with msketers who behaved in it with as much indecency as if it had been an alehouse they forced the bishop out of his palace and employed that in the same manner these are the most material hardships which according to the bishops own account happened to him which he seems to have born with patience and fortitude and may serve to show the violence of party rage and that religion is often made a pretense for committing the most outrageous insolence and horrid cruelty it has been already observed that hall seems to have been of an enthusiastic turn of mind which seldom consists with any brilliance of genius and in this case it holds true for in his sermons extant there is an imbecility which can flow from no other cause than wnt of parts in poetry however he seems to have greater power which will appear when we consider him in that light  it cannot positively be determined on what year bishop hall died he published that work of his

secular things the anthems for the cathedral of exeter   all these are printed in  to and were published    0 there are also other works of this author an edition of the whole has been printed in three vols folio  besides these works bishop hall is author of satires in six books lately reprinted under the title of virgidemiarum of which we cannot give a better account than in the words of the ingenious authors of the monthly review by which bishop halls genius for that kind of poetical writing will fully appear  he published these satires in the twenty third year of his age and was as he himself asserts in the prologue the first satirist in the english language i first adventure follow me who list and be the second english satyrist   and if we consider the dissiculty of introducing so nice a poem as satire into a nation we must allow it required the assistance of no common and ordinary genius the italians had their ariosto and the french their regnier who might have served him as models for imitation but he copies after the ancients and chiefly juvenal and persius though he wants not many strokes of elegance and delicacy which show him perfectly acquainted with the manner of horace among the several discouragements which attended his attempt in that kind he mentions one peculiar to the language and nature of the english versification which would appear in the translation of one of persiuss satires the difficulty and dissonance whereof says he shall make good my assertion besides the plain experience thereof in the satires of ariosto save which and one base french satire i could never attain the view of any for my direction yet we may pay him almost the same compliment which was given of old to homer and archilochus for the improvements which have been made by succeeding poets bear no manner of proportion to the distance of time between him and them the verses of bishop hall are in general extremely musical and flowing and are greatly preferable to dr donnes as being of a much smoother cadence neither shall we find him deficient if compared with his successor in point of thought and wit but he exceeds him with respect to his characters which are more numerous and wrought up with greater art and strength of coloring many of his lines would do honor to the most ingenious of our modern poets and some of them have thought it worth their labor to imitate him especially mr oldham bishop hall was not only our first satyrist but was the first who brought epistolary writing to the view of the public which was common in that age to other parts of europe but not practiced in england till he published his own epistles it may be proper to take notice that the virgidemiarum are not printed with his other writings and that an account of them is omitted by him through his extreme modesty in the specialities of his life prefixed to the third volume of his works in folio  the authors postscript to his satires is prefixed by the editor in the room of a preface and without any apparent impropriety it is not without some signatures of the bishops good sense and taste and making a just allowance for the use of a few obsolete terms and the puerile custom of that age in making affected repetitions and reiterations of the same word within the compass of a period it would read like no bad prose at present he had undoubtedly an excellent ear and we must conclude he must have succeeded considerably in erotic or pastoral poetry from the following stanzas in his defiance to envy which may be considered as an exordium to his poetical writings witness ye muses how i wilful sung these heady rhimes withouten second care and wished them worse my guilty thoughts among the ruder satire should go raggd and bare and show his rougher and his hairy hide though mine be smooth and decked in careless pride would we but breathe within a waxbound quill pans sevenfold pipe some plaintive pastoral to teach each hollow grove and shrubby hill each murmuring brook each solitary vale to sound our love and to our song accord wearying echo with one changelesse word or list us make two striving shepherds sing with costly wagers for the victory under menalcas judge while one does bring a carven bowl well wrought of beechen tree praising it by the story or the frame or want of use or skilful makers name another lays a wellmarked lamb or spotted kid or some more forward steer and from the paile does praise their fertile dam so do they strive in doubt in hope in fear awaiting for their trusty empires doom faulted as false by him that is overcome whether so me list my lovely thought to sing come dance ye nimble dryads by my side ye gentle woodnymphs come and with you bring the willing fawns that might their music guide come nymphs and fawns that haunts those shady groves while i report my fortunes or my loves   the first three books of satires are termed by the author toothless satires and the three last biting satires he has an animated idea of good poetry and a just contempt of poetasters in the different species of it he says of himself in the first satire nor can i crouch and writhe my fawning tail to some great patron for my best avayle such hungerstarven trencherpoetrie or let it never live or timely die   he frequently avows his admiration of spenser whose cotemporary he was his first book consisting of nine satires appears in a manner entirely levelled at low and abject poetasters several satires of the second book reprehend the contempt of the rich for men of science and genius we shall transcribe the sixth being short and void of all obscurity a gentle squire would gladly entertain into his house some trencherchaplaine some willing man that might instruct his sons and that would stand to good conditions first that he lie upon the trucklebed while his young master lies over his head second that he do on no default ever presume to sit above the salt third that he never change his trencher twice fourth that he use all common courtesies sit bare at meals and one half raise and wait last that he never his young master beat but he must ask his mother to define how many jerkes she would his breech should line all these observed he could contented be to give five marks and winter liverie   the seventh and last of this book is a very just and humorous satire against judicial astrology which was probably in as high credit then as witchcraft wa in the succeeding reign  the first satire of the third book is a strong contrast of the temperance and simplicity of former ages with the luxury and effeminacy of his own times which a reflecting reader would be apt to think no better than the present we find the good bishop supposes our ancestors as poorly fed as virgils and horaces rustics he says with sufficient energy thy grandsires words savored of thrifty leekes or manly garlic but thy furnace reekes hot steams of wine and can aloofe descrie the drunken draughts of sweet autumnitie   the second is a short satire on erecting stately monuments to worthless men the following advice is nobly moral the subsequent sarcasm just and well expresd thy monument make thou thy living deeds no other tomb than that true virtue needs what had he naught whereby he might be known but costly pilements of some curious stone the matter natures and the workmans frame his purses cost where then is osmonds name deservdst thou ill well were thy name and thee were thou inditched in great secrecy   the third gives an account of a citizens feast to which he was invited as he says with hollow words and slight overly request and whom he disappointed by accepting his invitation at once and not maydening it no insignificant term as he applies it for as he says who looks for double biddings to a feast may dine at home for an importune guest after a sumptuous bill of fare our author compares the great plenty of it to our present notion of a misers feast  saying come there no more for so meant all that cost never hence take me for thy second host   the fourth is levelled at ostentation in devotion or in dress the fifth represents the sad plight of a courtier whose perewinke as he terms it the wind had blown off by unbonnetting in a salute and exposed his waxen crown or scalp it is probable this might be about the time of their introduction into dress here the sixth which is a fragment contains a hyperbolical relation of a thirsty soul called gullion who drunk acheron dry in his passage over it and grounded charons boat but floated it again by as liberal a stream of urine it concludes with the following sarcastical yet wholesome irony drink on dry soul and pledge sir gullion drink to all healths but drink not to thine own   the seventh and last is a humorous description of a famished beau who had dined only with duke humfrey and who was strangely adorned with exotic dress  to these three satires he adds the following conclusion thus have i writ in smoother cedar tree so gentle satires penned so easily henceforth i write in crabbed oaktree rynde search they that mean the secret meaning find hold out ye guilty and ye galled hides and meet my farfetched stripes with waiting sides   in his biting satires he breathes still more of the spirit and style of juvenal his third of this book being an imitation of that satirists eighth on familymadness and pride of descent the beginning of which is not translated amiss by our author the principal object of his fourth satire gallio would correspond with a modern fribble but that he supposes him capable of hunting and hawking which are exercises rather too coarse and indelicate for ours this may intimate perhaps that the reign of the great elizabeth had no character quite so unmanly as our age in advising him to wed however we have no bad portrait of the petit maitre hye thee and give the world yet one dwarse more such as it got when thou thy self was bore   his fifth satire contrasts the extremes of prodigality and avarice and by a few initials which are skabbarded it looks as if he had some individuals in view though he has disclaimed such an itention in his postscript now the preface p   l n    etc his sixth sets out very much like the first satire of horaces first book on the dissatisfaction and caprice of mankind  qui fit mecaenas and after a just and lively description of our different pursuits in life he concludes with the following preference of a college one which we find in the specialities of his life he was greatly devoted to in his youth the lines which are far from inelegant seem indeed to come from his heart and make him appear as an exception to that too general human discontent which was the subject of this satire amongst all these stirs of discontented strife oh let me lead an academick life to know much and to think we nothing know nothing to have yet think we have enowe in skill to want and wanting seek for more in we will nor want nor wish for greater store envy ye monarchs with your proud excess at our low sail and our high happiness   the last satire of this book is a severe one on the clergy of the church of rome he terms it pomh pymh by which we suppose he intended to brand rome as the sink of superstition he observes if juvenal whom he calls aquines carping spright were now alive among other surprising alterations at rome  that he most would gaze and wonder at is the horned mitre and the bloody at the crooked staff their coules strange form and store save that he saw the same in hell before   the first satire of the fifth boek is levelled at racking landlords the following lines are a strong example of the taste of those times for the punn and paronomasia while freezing matho that for one lean fee will not term each term the term of hillary may now instead of those his simple fees get the feesimples of fair manneries   the second satire lashes the incongruity of stately buildings and want of hospitality and naturally reminds us of a pleasant epigram of martials on the same occasion where after describing the magnificence of a villa he concludes however there is no room either to sup or lodge in it it ends with a transition on the contumely with which the parasites are treated at the tables of the great being a pretty close imitation of juvenal on the same subject this satire has also a few skabbarded initials  in his third titled koina philon where he reprehends platos notion of a political community of all things are the following lines plato is dead and dead is his device which some thought witty none thought ever wise yet certes macha is a platonist to all they say save whosoever do not list because her husband a far traffick man is a professed peripatician   his last book and satire for it consists but of one is a humorous ironical recantation of his former satires as the author pretends there can be no just one in such perfect times as his own the latter part of it alludes to different passages in juvenal and he particularly reflects on some poetaster he calls labeo whom he had repeatedly lashed before and who was not improbably some cotemporary scribler  upon the whole these satires sufficiently evince both the learning and ingenuity of their author the sense has generally such a sufficient pause and will admit of such a punctuation at the close of the second line and the verse is very often as harmonious too as if it was calculated for a modern ear though the great number of obsolete words retained would incline us to think the editors had not procured any very extraordinary alteration of the original edition which we have never seen the present one is nearly printed and if it should occasion another we cannot think but a short glossary at the end of it or explanations at the bottom of the pages where the most uncouth and antiquated terms occur would justly increase the value of it by adding considerably to the perspicuity of this writer who in other respects seems to have been a learned divine a conscientious christian a lover of peace and well endued with patience for the exercise of which virtue the confusions at the latter end of his life about the time of the death of charles i furnished him with frequent opportunities the account of his own hard measures being dated in may      we have met with no other poetical writings of the bishops except three anthems composed for the use of his cathedralchurch and indeed it seems as if his continual occupation after his youth and his troubles in age were sufficient to suppress any future propensity to satirical poetry which we may infer from the conclusion of the first satire of his fourth book while now my rhimes relish of the ferule still some nosewise pedant faith whose deepseen skill has three times construed either flaccus over and thrice rehearsed them in his trivial flore so let them tax me for my hot bloods rage rather than say i doated in my age   richard crashaw son of an eminent divine named william crashaw was educated in grammar learning in suttonshospital called the charter house near london and in academical partly in pembrokehall of which he was a scholar and afterward in peterhouse cambridge of which he was a fellow where as in the former house he was distinguished for his latin and english poetry afterward he took the degree of master of arts but being soon after thrown out of his fellowship with many others of the university of cambridge for denying the covenant during the time of the rebellion he was for a time obliged to shift for himself and struggle against want and oppression at length being wearied with persecution and poverty and foreseeing the calamity which threatened and afterward fell upon his church and country by the unbounded fury of the presbyterians he changed his religion and went beyond sea in order to recommend himself to some popish preferment in paris but being a mere scholar was incapable of executing his new plan of a livelihood mr abraham cowley hearing of his being there endeavored to find him out which he did and to his great surprise saw him in a very miserable plight this happened in the year      this generous bard gave him all the assistance he could and obtained likewise some relief for him from henrietta maria the queen dowager thn residing at paris our author receiving letters of recommendation from his queen he took a journey into italy and by virtue of those letters became a secretary to a cardinal at rome and at length one of the canons or chaplains of the rich church of our lady of loretto some miles distant from thence where he died in    0  this conduct of crashaw can by no means be justified when a man changes one religion for another he ought to do it at a time when no motive of interest can well be supposed to have produced it for it does no honor to religion nor to the person who becomes a convert when it is evident he would not have altered his opinion had not his party been suffering and what would have become of the church of england what of the protestant religion what of christianity in general had the apostles and primitive martyrs and later champions for truth meanly abandoned it like crashaw because the hand of power was lifted up against it it is an old observation that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church but crashaw took care that the church should reap no benefit by his perseverance before he left england he wrote poems entitled steps to the temple and wood says that he led his life in st marys church near to peterhouse where he lodged under tertullians roof of angels there he made his nest more glad than davids swallow near the house of god where like a primitive saint he offered more prayers in the night than others usually offer in the day there he penned the poems called steps to the temple for happy souls to climb to heaven by to the said steps are joined other poems entitled the delights of the muses wherein are several latin poems which though of a more humane mixture yet are sweet as they are innocent he has also written carmen deo nostro being hymns and other sacred poems addressed to the countess of denbigh he is said to have been master of five languages besides his mother tongue viz hebrew greek latin italian and spanish  mr crashaw seems to have been a very delicate and chaste writer his language is pure his thoughts natural and his manner of writing tender  william rowley an author who lived in the reign of charles i and was some time a member of pembrokehall in cambridge there are no particulars on record concerning this poet he was beloved says langbaine by shakespeare johnson and fletcher and writ with the former the british merlin besides what he joined in writing with poets of the third class as heywood middleton day and webster  the author has six plays in print of his own writing which are as follows   a new wonder a woman never vexed a comedy acted anno      the widows finding her wedding ring which she dropped crossing the thames in the belly of a fish is taken from the story of polycrates in the thalia of herodotus   a match at midnight a comedy acted by the children of the revels      part of the plot is taken from a story in the english rogue part the fourth   all is lost by lust a tragedy acted at the phoenix in drury lane by the lady elizabeths servants      this is esteemed a tolerable play   shoemakers a gentleman a comedy acted at the redbull      this play was afterward revived at the theater in dorsetgarden plot from crispin and crispianus or the history of the gentle craft   the witch of edmonton a tragicomedy acted by the princes servants at the cockpit in drury lane      this play was afterward acted at court with applause   the birth of merlin a tragicomedy      the plot from geofrey of monmouth shakespeare assisted in this play he joined with middleton in his spanish gypsies webster in his thracian wonder   thomas nash a versifier in the reign of king charles i was educated in the university of cambridge and was designed for holy orders he was descended from a family in hertfordshire and was born at leostoff in suffolk whether he obtained any preferment in the church or was honored with any great mans patronage is no where determined it is reasonable to believe the contrary because good fortune is seldom without the evidence of flattery or envy whereas distress and obscurity are almost inseparable companions this is further confirmed in some lines vehemently passionate in a performance of his called piers penniless which to say nothing of the poetry are a strong picture of rage and despair and part of which as they will show that he was no mean versifier shall be quoted by way of specimen in the abovementioned piece of piers penniless or supplication to the devil he had some reflections on the parentage of dr harvey his sather being aropemaker of saffronwalden this produced contests between the doctor and him so that it became a paper war amongst other books which mr nash wrote against him was one entitled have with ye to saffron walden and another called four letters confuted he wrote likewise a poem called the white herring and the red he has published two plays dido queen of carthage in which he joined with marloe and summers last will and testament a comedy langbaine says he could never procure a sight of either of these but as to the play called see me and see me not ascribed to him by winstanley he says it is written by one drawbridgecourt belchier esquire thomas nash had the reputation of a sharp satirist which talent he exerted with a great deal of acrimony against the covenanters and puritans of his time he likewise wrote a piece called the fourfold way to happiness in a dialogue between a countryman citizen divine and lawyer printed in  to london       in an old poem called the return to parnassus or a scourge for simony nashs character is summed up in four lines which mrs cooper thinks is impartially done let all his faults sleep in his mournful chest and there for ever with his ashes rest his style was witty tho he had some gall something he might have mended  so may all   from his piers penniless why is it damnation to despair and die when life is my true happiness disease my soul my soul thy safety makes me fly the faulty means that might my pain appease divines and dying men may talk of hell but in my heart her several torments dwell ah worthless wit to train me to this woe deceitful arts that nourish discontent ill thrive the folly that bewitched me so vain thoughts adieu for now i will repent and yet my wants persuade me to proceed since none take pity of a scholars need forgive me god although i curse my birth and ban the air wherein i breath a wretch since misery has daunted all my mirth and i am quite undone through promise breach o friends no friends that then ungently frown when changing fortune casts us headlong down without redress complains my careless verse and midas ears relent not at my moan in some far land will i my griefs rehearse amongst them that will be moved when i shall groan england adieu the soil that brought me forth adieu unkind where still is nothing worth   john ford a gentleman of the middle temple who wrote in the reign of charles i he was a wellwisher to the muses and a friend and acquaintance of most of the poets of his time he was not only a partner with rowley and decker in the witch of edmonton and with decker in the suns darling but wrote likewise himself seven plays most of which were acted at the phaenix in the blackfryars and may be known by an anagram instead of his name generally printed in the title page viz  fide honor  his genius was more turned for tragedy than comedy which occasioned an old poet to write thus of him deep in a dump john ford was alone got with folded arms and melancholy hat   these particulars i find in mr langbaine who gives the following account of his plays   broken heart a tragedy acted by the kings servants at the private house in blackfryars printed in  to london      and dedicated to lord craven baron of hamsteadmarshal the speakers names are fitted to their qualities and most of them are derived from greek etymologies   fancies chaste and noble a tragicomedy acted by the queens

to london      and dedicated to the society of graysinn this play is commended by four of the authors friends one of whom writes the following tetrastich it is not the language nor the foreplaced rhimes of friends that shall commend to after times the lovers melancholy it is own worth without a borrowed praise shall set it forth the author says langbaine has imbellished this play with several fancies from other writers which he has appositely brought in as the story of the contention between the musician and the nightingale described in stradas academical prolusions lib ii prol      loves sacrifice a tragedy received generally well acted by the queens servants at the phoenix in drury lane printed  to land      there is a copy of verses prefixed to this play written by james shirley

explanation of the design alluding to the four seasons of the year   it is pity she is a whore a tragedy printed in  to mr langbaine says that this equals if not exceeds any of our authors performances and were to be commended did not he paint the incestuous love between giovanni and his sister annabella in too beautiful colors i have not been able to ascertain the year in which this author died but imagine from circumstances that it must have been some time before the restoration and before the year      for the suns darling written between him and decker was published in      which mr langbaine says was after their decease   thomas middleton lived in the reign of king charles i he was cotemporary with johnson fletcher maslinger and rowley in whose friendship he is said to have shared and though he fell much short of the two former yet being joined with them in writing plays he arrived at some reputation he joined with fletcher and johnson in a play called the widow and the highest honor that is known of this poet is his being admitted to make a triumvirate with two such great men he joined with massinger and rowley in writing the old law he was likewise assisted by rowley in writing three plays langbaines lives of the poets p   0  we have not been able to find any particulars of this mans life further than his friendship and connection already mentioned owing to
