public good being an examination into the claim of virginia to the vacant western territory and of the right of the united states to the same  to which is added proposals for laying off a new state to be applied as a fund for carrying on the war or redeeming the national debt  by the author of common sense  philadelphia printed by john dunlap in market street  mdcclxxx  the preface the following pages are on a subject hitherto little understood but highly interesting to the united states  they contain an investigation of the claims of virginia to the vacant western territory and of the right of the united states to the same with some outlines of a plan for laying out a new state to be applied as a fund for carrying on the war or redeeming the national debt  the reader in the course of this publication will find it studiously plain and as far as i can judge perfectly candid what materials i could get at i have endeavored to place in a clear line and deduce such arguments therefrom as the subject required in the prosecution of it i have considered myself as an advocate for the right of the states and taken no other liberty with the subject than what a counsel would and ought to do in behalf of a client  i freely confess that the respect i had conceived and still preserve for the character of virginia was a constant check upon those sallies of imagination which are fairly and advantageously indulged against an enemy but ungenerous when against a friend  if there is any thing i have omitted or mistaken to the injury of the intentions of virginia or her claims i shall gladly rectify it or if there is any thing yet to add should the subject require it i shall as cheerfully undertake it being fully convinced that to have matters fairly discussed and properly understood is a principal means of preserving harmony and perpetuating friendship  the author  public good etc when we take into view the mutual happiness and united interests of the states of america and consider the important consequences to arise from a strict attention of each and of all to every thing which is just reasonable and honorable or the evils that will follow from an inattention to those principles there cannot and ought not to remain a doubt but that the governing rule of right and mutual good must in all public cases finally preside  the hand of providence has cast us into one common lot and accomplished the independence of america by the unanimous consent of the several parts concurring at once in time manner and circumstances no superiority of interest at the expense of the rest induced the one more than the other into the measure virginia and maryland it is true might foresee that their staple commodity tobacco by being no longer monopolized by britain would bring them a better price abroad for as the tax on it in england was treble its first purchase from the planter and they being now no longer compelled to send it under that obligation and in the restricted manner they formerly were it is easy to see that the article from the alteration of the circumstances of trade will and daily does turn out to them with additional advantages  but this being a natural consequence produced by that common freedom and independence of which all are partakers is therefore an advantage they are entitled to and on which the rest of the states can congratulate them without feeling a wish to lessen but rather to extend it to contribute to the increased prosperity of another by the same means which occasion our own is an agreeable reflection and the more valuable any article of export becomes the more riches will be introduced into and spread over the continent  yet this is an advantage which those two states derive from the independence of america superior to the local circumstances of the rest and of the two it more particularly belongs to virginia than maryland because the staple commodity of a considerable part of maryland is flour which as it is an article that is the growth of europe as well as of america cannot obtain a foreign market but by under selling or at least by limiting it to the current price abroad but tobacco commands its own price it is not a plant of almost universal growth like wheat there are but few soils and climes that produce it to advantage and before the cultivation of it in virginia and maryland the price was from four to sixteen shillings sterling a pound in england see sir dalby thomass historical account of the rise and growth of the west india colonies   but the condition of the vacant western territory of america makes a very different case to that of the circumstances of trade in any of the states those very lands formed in contemplation the fund by which the debt of america would in a course of years be redeemed they were considered as the common right of all and it is only till lately that any pretension of claims has been made to the contrary  that difficulties and differences will arise in communities ought always to be looked for the opposition of interests real or supposed the variety of judgments the contrariety of temper and in short the whole composition of man in his individual capacity is tinctured with a disposition to contend but in his social capacity there is either a right which being proved terminates the dispute or a reasonableness in the measure where no direct right can be made out which decides or compromises the matter  as i shall have frequent occasion to mention the word right i wish to be clearly understood in my definition of it there are various senses in which this term is used and custom has in many of them afforded it an introduction contrary to its true meaning we are so naturally inclined to give the utmost degree of force to our own case that we call every pretension however founded a right and by this means the term frequently stands opposed to justice and reason  after theodore was elected king of corsica not many years ago by the mere choice of the natives for their own convenience in opposing the genoese he went over into england run himself into debt got himself into jail and on his release therefrom by the benefit of an act of insolvency he surrendered up what he called his kingdom of corsica as a part of his personal property for the use of his creditors some of whom may hereafter call this a charter or by any other name more fashionable and ground thereon what they may term a right to the sovereignty and property of corsica but does not justice abhor such an action both in him and them under the prostituted name of a right and must not laughter be excited where ever it is told  a right to be truly so must be right in itself yet many things have obtained the name of rights which are originally founded in wrong of this kind are all rights by mere conquest power or violence in the cool moments of reflection we are obliged to allow that the mode by which such right is obtained is not the best suited to that spirit of universal justice which ought to preside equally over all mankind there is something in the establishment of such a right that we wish to slip over as easily as possible and say as little about as can be but in the case of a right founded in right the mind is carried cheerfully into the subject feels no compuction fuffers no distress subjects its sensations to no violences nor sees any thing in its way which requires an artificial smoothing  from this introduction i proceed to examine into the claims of virginia first as to the right secondly as to the reasonableness and lastly as to the consequences  the name virginia originally bore a different meaning to what it does now it stood in the place of the word north america and seems to have been intended as a name comprehensive of all the english settlements or colonies on the continent and not descriptive of any one as distinguishing it from the rest all to the southward of chesapeak as low as the gulf of mexico was called southvirginia and all to the northward northvirginia in a similar line of distinction as we now call the whole continent north and southamerica oldmixons history of virginia   the first charter or patent was to sir walter rawleigh by queen elizabeth of england in the year      and had neither name nor bounds upon sir walters return the name virginia was given to the whole country including the now united states consequently the present virginia either as a province or a state can sit up no exclusive claim to the western territory under this patent and that for two reasons first because the words of the patent run to sir walter rawleigh and such persons as he should nominate themselves and their successors which is a line of succession virginia does not pretend to stand in and secondly because a prior question would arise namely who are to be understood by virginians under this patent and the answer would be all the inhabitants of america from new england to florida  this patent therefore would destroy their exclusive claim and invest the right collectively in the thirteen states  but it unfortunately happened that the settlers under this patent partly from misconduct the opposition of the indians and other calamities discontinued the process and the patent became extinct  after this james the first who in the year   0  succeeded elizabeth issued a new patent which i come next to describe  this patent differed from the former in this essential point that it had limits whereas the other had none the former was intended to promote discoveries where ever they could be made which accounts why no limits were affixed and this to settle discoveries already made which likewise assigns a reason why limits should be deseribed  in this patent were incorporated two companies called the southvirginia company and the northvirginia company and sometimes the london company and the plymouth company  the southvirginia or london company was composed chiefly of london adventurers the northvirginia or plymouth company was made up of adventurers from plymouth in devonshire and other persons of the western parts of england  though they were not to fix together yet they were allowed to choose their places of settlement any where on the coast of america then called virginia between the latitudes of    and    degrees which was a range of   0 miles the south company was not to go below    degrees nor the north company above    degrees but the patent expressed that as soon as they had made their choice each was to become limited to  0 miles each way on the coast and  00 up the country so that the grant to each company was a square of  00 miles and no more the northvirginia or plymouth company settled to the eastward and in the year      changed the name and called that part new england the southvirginia or london company settled near cape henry  this then cannot be the patent of boundless extent and that for two reasons first because the limits are described namely a square of  00 miles and secondly because there were two companies of equal rights included in the same patent  three years after this that is in the year   0  the southvirginia company applied for new powers from the crown of england which were granted them in a new patent and the boundaries of the grant enlarged and this is the charter or patent on which some of the present virginians ground their pretension to boundless territory  the first reflection that presents itself on this enlargement of the grant is that it must be supposed to bear some intended degree of reasonable comparison to that which it superceded the former could not be greater than a square of one hundred miles and this new one being granted in the lieu of that and that within the space of three years and by the same person james the first who was never famed either for profusion or generosity cannot on a review of the time and circumstances of the grant be supposed a very extravagant or very extraordinary one if a square of one hundred miles was not sufficiently large twice that quantity was as much as could well be expected or solicited but to suppose that he who had caution enough to confine the first grant within moderate bounds should in so short a space as three years supercede it by another grant of many million times greater content is on the face of the affair a circumstantial nullity  whether this patent or charter was in existence or not at the time the revolution commenced is a matter i shall hereafter speak to and confine myself in this place to the limits which the said patent or charter lays down  the words are as follow beginning from the cape or point of land called cape or point comfort thence all along the sea coast to the northward  00 miles and from the said point or cape comfort all along the sea coast to the southward  00 miles and all that space or circuit of land lying from the sea coast of the precinct aforesaid up into the land throughout from sea to sea west and northwest  the first remark i shall offer on the words of this grant is that they are uncertain obscure and unintelligible and may be construed into such a variety of contradictory meanings as to leave at last no meaning at all  whether the  00 miles each way from cape comfort were to be on a straight line or ascertained by following the indented line of the coast that is all along the sea coast in and out as the coast lay cannot now be fully determined because as either will admit of supposition and nothing but supposition can be produced therefore neither can be taken as positive thus far may be said that had it been intended to be a straight line the word straight ought to have been inserted which would have made the matter clear but as no inference can well be drawn to the advantage of that which does not appear against that which does therefore the omission implies negatively in favor of the coast indented line or that the  00 miles were to be traced on the windings of the coast that is all along the sea coast  but what is meant by the words west and northwest is still more unintelligible whether they mean a west line and a northwest line or whether they apply to the general lying of the land from the atlantic without regard to lines cannot again be determined but if they are supposed to mean lines to be run then a new difficulty of more magnitude than all the rest arises namely from which end of the extent on the coast is the west line and the northwest line to be set off as the difference in the content of the grant occasioned by transposing them is many hundred million of acres and either includes or excludes a far greater quantity of land than the whole thirteen united states contain  in short there is not a boundary in this grant that is clear fixed and defined the coast line is uncertain and that being the base on which the others are to be formed renders the whole uncertain but even if this line was admitted in either shape the other boundaries would still be on supposition till it might be said there is no boundary at all and consequently no charter for words which describe nothing can give nothing  the advocates for the virginia claim laying hold of these ambiguities have explained the grant thus  four hundred miles on the sea coast and from the south point a west line to the great south sea and from the north point a northwest line to the said south sea the figure which these lines produce will be thus west line to the south sea  000 miles   00 s  cape comfort   00 n  northwest line endless  new york new england    but why i ask must the west land line be set off from the south point any more than from the north point the grant or patent does not say from which it shall be neither is it clear that a line is the thing intended by the words but admitting it is on what grounds do the claimants proceed in making this choice the answer i presume is easily given namely because it is the most beneficial explanation to themselves they can possibly make as it takes in many thousand times more extent of country than any other explanation would but this though it be a very good reason to them is a very bad reason to us and though it may do for the claimants to hope upon will not answer to plead upon especially to the very people who to confirm the partiality of the claimants choice must relinquish their own right and interest  why not set off the west land line from the north end of the coast line and the northwest line from the south end of the same there is some reason why this should be the construction and none why the other should  first because if the line of two hundred miles each way from cape comfort be traced by following the indented line of the coast which seems to be the implied intention of the words and a west line be set off from the north end and a northwest line from the south end these lines will all unite which the other construction never can and form a complete triangle the content of which will be about twenty nine or thirty millions of acres or something larger than penusylvania and  secondly because this construction is following the order of the lines as expressed in the grant for the first mentioned coast line which is that to the northward of cape comfort and the first mentioned land line which is the west line have a numerical relation being the first mentioned of each and implies that the west line was to be set off from the north point and not from the south point and consequently the two last mentioned of each have the same numerical relation and again implies that the northwest line was to be set off from the south point and not from the north point but why the claimants should break through the order of the lines and contrary to implication join the first mentioned of the one to the last mentioned of the other and thereby produce a shapeless monster for which there is no name nor any parallel in the world either as to extent of soil or sovereignty is a construction that cannot be supported  the figure produced by following the order of the lines is as under  n b if the reader will cast his eye again over the words of the patent on page  0 he will perceive the namerical relation alluded to by observing that the first mentioned coast line and the first mentioned land line are distinguished by capitals and the last mentioned of each by italics which i have chosen to do to illustrate the explanation  northwest line   00 s  cape comfort   00 n  west line    i presume that if four hundred miles be traced by fol lowing the inslexes of any sea shore that the two extremes will not be more than three hundred miles distant from each other on a straight line therefore to find the content of a triangle whose base is three hundred miles multiply the length of the base into half the perpendicular which in this case is the west line and the product will be the answer   00 miles length of the base   0 half the perpendicular supposing it a right angled triangle   000  00   000 content of the grant in square miles   0 acres in a square mile   00000   0000    00000 content in square acres  now will any one undertake to say that this explanation is not as fairly drawn if not more so from the words themselves as any other that can be offered because it is not only justified by the exact words of the patent grant or charter or any other name by which it may be called but by their implied meaning and is likewise of such a content as may be supposed to have been intended whereas the claimants explanation is without bounds and beyond every thing that is reasonable yet after all who can say what were the precise meaning of terms and expressions so loosely formed and capable of such a variety of contradictory interpretations  had the order of the lines been otherwise than they are in the patent the reasonableness of the thing must have directed the manner in which they should be connected but as the claim is founded in unreasonableness and that unreasonableness endeavored to be supported by a transposition of the lines there remains no pretense for the claim to stand on  perhaps those who are interested in the claimants explanation will say that as the south sea is spoken of the lines must be as they explain them in order to reach it  to this i reply first that no man then knew how far it was from the atlantic to the south sea as i shall presently show but believed it to be but a short distance and  secondly that the uncertain and ambiguous manner in which the south fea is alluded to for it is not mentioned by name but only  from sea to sea serves to perplex the vatent and not to explain it and as no right can be founded on an arobiguity but on some proof cleared of ambiguity therefore the allusive introduction of sea to sea can yield no service to the claim  there is likewise an ambiguous mention made of two lands in this patent as well as of two seas viz and all that space or circuit of land lying from the sea coast of the precinct oforesaid up into the land throughout from sea to sea  on which i remark that the two lauds here mentioned have the appearance of a major and a minor or the greator out of which the less is to be taken and the term from sea to sea may be said to apply descriptively to the land throughout and not to the space or circuit of land patented to the company in a similar manner that the former patent described a major of   0 miles extent out of which the minor or square of one hundred miles was to be chosen  but to suppose that because the south sea is darkly alluded to it must therefore at whatever distance it might be which then nobody knew or for whatever purpose it might be introduced be made a certain boundary and that without regard to the reasonableness of the matter or the order in which the lines are arranged which is the only implication the patent gives for setting off the land lines is a supposition that contradicts every thing which is reasonable  the figure produced by following the order of the lines will be complete in itself let the distance to the south sea be more or less because if the land throughout from sea to sea had not been sufficiently extensive to admit the west land line and the northwest land line to close the south sea it that case would have eventually become a boundary but if the extent of the land throughout from sea to sea was so great that the lines closed without reaching the said south sea the figure was complete without it  wherefore as the order of the lines when raised on the indented coast line produces a regular figure of reasonable dimensions and of about the same content though not of the same shape which virginia now holds within the allegany mountains and by transposing them another sigure is produced for which there is no name and cannot be completed as i shall presently explain and of an extent greater than one half of europe it is needless to offer any other arguments to show that the order of the lines must be the rule if any rule can be drawn from the words for ascertaining from which point the west line and northwest line were to be set off neither is it possible to suppose any other rule could be followed because a northwest line set off two hundred miles above cape comfort would not only never touch the south sea but would form a spiral line or infinite windings round the globe and after passing over the northern parts of america and the frozen ocean and then into the northern parts of asia would when eternity should end and not before terminate in the north pole  this is the only manner in which i can express the effect of a northwest line set off as above because as its direction must always be between the north and the west it consequently can never get into the pole nor yet come to a rest and on the principle that matter or space is capable of being eternally divided must proceed on for ever  but it was a prevailing opinion at the time this patent was obtained that the south sea was at no great distance from the atlantic and therefore it was needless under that supposition to regard which way the lines should be run neither need we wonder at this error in the english government respecting america then when we see so many and such glaring ones now for which there are less excuse  some circumstances favored this mistake admiral sir francis drake not long before this had from the top of a mountain in the isthmus of darien which is the center of north and south america seen both the south sea and the atlantic the width of the part of the continent where he then was not being above  0 miles whereas its width opposite chesapeakbay is as great if not greater than in any other part being from sea to sea about the distance it is from america to england but this could not then be known because only two voyages had been made across the south sea the one by the ship in which magellan sailed who died in his passage and which was the first ship that failed round the world and the other by sir francis drake but as neither of these sailed into a northern latitude in that ocean high enough to fix the longitude of the western coast of america from the eastern the distance across was entirely on supposition and the errors they then ran into appear laughable to us who now know what the distance is  that the company expected to come at the south sea without much trouble or traveling and that the great body of land which intervened so far from being their view in obtaining the charter became their disappointment may be collected from a circumstance mentioned in stiths history of virginia  he relates that in the year   0  which was at the time the company were soliciting this patent they fitted up in england a barge for captain newport who was afterward one of the joint deputy governors under the very charter we are now treating of which for convenience of carriage might be taken into five pieces and with which he and his company were instructed to go up james river as far as the falls thereof to discover the country of the monakins and from thence they were to proceed carrying their barge beyond the falls to convey them to the south sea being ordered not to return without a lump of gold or a certainty of the said sea  and hutchinson in his history of new england which was called northvirginia at the time this patent was obtained says the geography of this part of america was less understood than at present a line to the spanish settlements was imagined much shorter than it really was some of champlains people in the beginning of the last century who had been but a few days march from quebec returned with great joy supposing that from the top of a high mountain they had discovered the south sea  from these matters which are evidences on record it appears that the adventurers had no knowledge of the distance it was to the south sea but supposed it to be no great way from the atlantic and also that great extent of territory was not their object but a short communication with the southern ocean by which they might get into the neighborhood of the gold coast and likewise carry on a commerce with the east indies  having thus shown the confused and various interpretations this charter is subject to and that it may be made to mean any thing and nothing i now proceed to show that let the limits of it be more or less the present virginia does not and cannot as a matter of right inherit under it  i shall open this part of the subject by putting the following case  either virginia stands in succession to the london company to whom the charter was granted or to the crown of england if to the london company then it becomes her as an outset in the matter to show who they were and likewise that they were in possession at the commencement of the revolution  if to the crown then the charter is of consequence superseded because the crown did not possess territories by charter but by prerogative without charter the notion of the crown chartering to itself is a nullity and in this case the unpossessed lands be they little or much are in the same condition as if they never had been chartered at all and the sovereignty of them devolves to the sovereignty of the united states  the charter or patent of   0  as well as that of   0  was to sir thomas gates sir george summers the reverend richard hackluit prebend of westminster and others and the government was then proprietary those proprietors by virtue of the charter of   0  chose lord delaware for their governor and sir thomas gates sir george summers and captain newport the person who was to go with a boat to the south sea joint deputy governors  was this the form of government either as to soil or constitution at the time the present revolution commenced if not the charter was not in being for it matters not to us how it came to be out of being so long as the present virginians or their ancestors neither are nor were sufferers by the change then made  but suppose it could be proved to be in being which it cannot because being in a charter is power it would only prove a right in behalf of the london company of adventurers but how that right is to be disposed of is another question we are not defending the right of the london company deceased   0 years ago but taking up the matter at the place where we found it and so far as the authority of the crown of england was exercised when the revolution commenced  the charter was a contract between the crown of england and those adventurers for their own emolument and not between the crown and the people of virginia and whatever was the occasion of the contract becoming void or surrendered up or superceded makes no part of the question now it is sufficient that when the united states succeeded to sovereignty they found no such contract in existence or even in litigation they found virginia under the authority of the crown of england both as to soil and government subject to quitrents to the crown and not to the company and had been so for upwards of   0 years and that an instrument or deed of writing of a private nature as all proprietary contracts are so far as land is concerned and which is now only historically known and in which virginia was no party and to which no succession in any line can be proved and have ceased for   0 years should now be raked from oblivion and held up as a charter whereon to assume a right to boundless territory and that by a perversion of the order of it is something very singular and extraordinary  if there was any innovation on the part of the crown the contest rested between the crown and the proprietors the london company and not between virginia and the said crown it was not her charter it was the companys charter and the only parties in the case were the crown and the company  but why if virginia contends for the immutability of charters has she selected this in preference to the two former ones all her arguments arising from this principle must go to the first charter and not to the last but by placing them to the last instead of the first she admits a fact against her principle because in order to establish the last she proves the first to be vacated by the second in the space of    years the second to be vacated by the third in the space of   years and why the third should not be vacated by the fourth form of government issuing from the same power with the former two and which took place about    years after and continued in being for   0 years since and under which all her public and private business was transacted her purchases made her warrants for survey and patents for land obtained is too mysterious to account for  either the reassumption of the london companys charter into the hands of the crown was an usurpation or it was not if it was then strictly speaking is every thing which virginia has done under that usurpation illegal and she may be said to have lived in the most curious species of rebellion ever known rebellion against the london company of adventurers for if the charter to the company for it was not to the virginians ought to be in being now it ought to have been in being then and why she should admit its vacation then and reject it now is unaccountable or why she should esteem her purchases of lands good which were then made contrary to this charter and now contend for the operation of the same charter to possess new territory by are circumstances which cannot be reconciled  but whether the charter as it is called ought to be extinct or not cannot make a question with us all the parties concerned in it are deceased and no successors in any regular line of succession appear to claim neither the london company of adventurers their heirs or assigns were in possession of the exercise of this charter at the commencement of the revolution and therefore the state of virginia does not in point of fact succeed to and inherit from the company  but say they we succeed to and inherit from the crown of england which was the immediate possessor of of the sovereignty at the time we entered and had been so for   0 years  to say this is to say there is no charter at all a charter is an assurance from one party to another and cannot be from the same party to itself  but before i enter further on this case i shall concisely state how this charter came to be reassumed by the power which granted it the crown of england  i have already stated that it was a proprietary charter or grant to sir thomas gates and others who were called the london company and sometimes the southvirginia company to distinguish them from those who settled to the eastward now new england and were then called the northvirginia or plymouth company  oldmixons history of virginia in his account of the british empire in america published in the year   0  gives a concise progress of the affair he attributes it to the misconduct contentions and mismanagement of the proprietors and their innovations upon the indians which had so exasperated them that they fell on the settlers and destroyed at one time     men women and children  some time after this massacre says he several gentlemen in england procured grants of land from the company and others came over on their private accounts to make settlements among the former was one captain martin who was named to be of the council this man raised so many differences among them that new distractions followed which the indians observing took heart and once more fell upon the settlers on the borders destroying without pitying either age sex or condition  these and other calamities being chiefly imputed to the mismanagement of the proprietors whose losses had so discouraged most of their best members that they sold their shares and charles the first on his accession to the throne dissolved the company and took the colony into his own immediate direction he appointed the governor and council himself ordered all patents and process to issue in his own name and reserved a quitrent of two shillings sterling for every hundred acres  thus far our author now it is impossible for us at this distance of time to say what were all the exact causes of the change neither have we any business with it the company might surrender it or they might not or they might forfeit it by not fulfilling conditions or they might sell it or the crown might as far as we know take it from them but what are either of these cases to virginia or any other which can be produced she was not a party in the matter it was not her charter neither can she ingraft any right upon it or suffer any injury under it  if the charter was vacated it must have been by the london company if it was surrendered it must be by the same if it was sold nobody else could sell it and if it was taken from them nobody else could lose it and yet virginia calls this her charter which it was not within her power to hold to sell to vacate or to lose  but if she puts her right upon the ground that it never was sold surrendered lost or vacated by the london company she admits that if they had sold surrendered lost or vacated it that it would have become extinct and to her no charter at all and in this case the only thing to prove is the fact which is has this charter been the rule of government and of purchasing or procuring unappropriated lands in virginia from the time it was granted to the time of the revolution answer the charter has not been the rule of government nor of purchasing or procuring lands neither has any lands been purchased or procured under its sanction or authority for upwards of   0 years  but if she goes a step further and say that they could not vacate surrender sell or lose it by any act they could do so neither could they vacate surrender sell or lose that of   0  which was three years prior to this and this argument so far from establishing the charter of   0  would destroy it and in its stead confirm the preceding one which limited the company to a square of  00 miles and if she still goes back to that of sir walter rawleigh that only places her in the light of americans in common with all  the only fact that can be clearly proved is that the crown of england exercised the power of dominion and government in virginia and of the disposal of the lands and that the charter had neither been the rule of government or purchasing lands for upwards of   0 years and this places virginia in succession to the crown and not to the company consequently it proves a lapse of the charter into the hands of the crown by some means or other  now to suppose that the charter could return into the hands of the crown and yet remain in force is to suppose that a man could be bound by a bond of obligation to himself  its very being in the hands of the crown from which it issued is a cessation of its existence and an effectual unchartering all that part of the grant which was not before disposed of and consequently the state of virginia standing thus in succession to the crown can be entitled to no more extent of country as a state under the union than what it possessed as a province under the crown and all lands exterior to these bounds as well of virginia as the rest of the states devolve in the order of succession to the sovereignty of the united states for the benefit of all  and this brings the case to what were the limits of virginia as a province under the crown of england  charter it had none it is limits then rested at the discretion of the authority to which it was subjest maryland and pennsylvania became it is boundary to the eastward and northward and north carolina to the southward therefore the boundary to the westward was the only principal line to be ascertained  as virginia from a proprietary soil and government was become what then bore the name of a royal one the extent of the province as the order of things then stood for something must always be admitted whereon to form a beginning was wholly at the disposal of the crown of england who might enlarge or diminish or erect new governments to the westward by the same authoritative right that virginia now can divide a county into two if too large or too inconvenient  to say as has been said that pennsylvania maryland and north carolina were taken out of virginia is no more than to say they were taken out of america because virginia was the common name of all the country north and south and to say they were taken out of the chartered limits of virginia is likewise to say nothing because after the dissolution or extinction of the proprietary company there was nobody to whom any provincial limits became chartered the extinction of the company was the extinction of the chartered limits the patent could not survive the company because it was to them a right which when they expired ceased to be any bodys else in their stead  but to return to the western boundary of virginia at the commencement of the revolution  charters like proclamations were the sole act of the crown and if the former were adequate to fix limits to the lands which it gave away sold or otherways disposed of the latter were equally adequate to fix limits or divisions to those which it retained and therefore the western limits of virginia as the proprietary company was extinct and consequently the patent with it must be looked for in the line of proclamations  i am not fond of quoting these old remains of former arrogance but as we must begin somewhere and as the states have agreed to regulate the right of each state to territory by the condition each stood in with the crown of england at the commencement of the revolution we have no other rule to go by and any rule which can be agreed on is better than none  from the proclamation then of      the western limits of virginia as a province under the crown of england are described so as not to extend beyond the heads of any of the rivers which empty themselves into the atlantic and consequently the limits did not pass over the allegany mountain  extract from the proclamation of      so far as respects boundary  and whereas it is just and reasonable and essential to our interest and the security of our colonies that the several nations or tribes of indians with whom we are connected and who live under our protection should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions and territories as not having been ceded to or purchased by us are reserved to them or any of them as their hunting grounds we do therefore with the advice of our privy council declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that no governor or commander in chief in any of our colonies of quebec east florida or west florida do presume upon any pretense whatever to grant warrants of survey or pass any patents for lands beyond the bounds of their respective governments as described in their commissions as also that no governor or commander in chief of our other colonies or plantations in america do presume for the present and until our further pleasure be known to grant warrants of survey or pass patents for any lands beyond the heads or sources of any of the rivers which fall into the atlantic ocean from the west or northwest or upon any lands whatever which not having been ceded to or purchased by us as aforesaid are reserved unto the said indians or any of them  and we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleasure for the present as aforesaid to reserve under our sovereignty protection and dominion for the use of the said indians all the lands and territories not included within the limits of our said three new governments or within the limits of the territory granted to the hudsonsbay company as also all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and northwest as aforesaid and we do hereby strictly forbid on pain of our displeasure all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlements whatever or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved without our especial leave and license for that purpose first obtained  and we do further strictly enjoin and require all persons whatever who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any lands within the countries above described or upon any other lands which not having been ceded to or purchased by us are still reserved to the said indians as aforesaid forthwith to remove themselves from such settlements  it is easy for us to understand that the frequent and plausible mention of the indians was only speciousness to create an idea of the humanity of government the object and intention of the proclamation was the western boundary which is here signified not to extend beyond the heads of the rivers and these then are the western limits which virginia had as a province under the crown of britain  and agreeable to the intention of this proclamation and the limits described thereby lord hilsborough then secretary of state in england addressed an official letter of the   st of july    0 to lord bottetourt at that time governor of virginia which letter was laid before the council of virginia by mr president nelson and by him answered on the   th of october in the same year of which the following are extracts  on the evening of the day your lordships letter to the governor was delivered to me and as it contains matters of great variety and importance it was read in council and together with the several papers enclosed it has been maturely considered and i now trouble your lordship with theirs as well as my own opinion upon the subject of them  we do not presume to say to whom our gracious sovereign shall grant his vacant lands and with respect to the establishment of a new colony on the back of virginia it is a subject of too great political importance for me to presume to give an opinion upon however permit me my lord to observe that when that part of the country shall become sufficiently populated it may be a wise and prudent measure  on the death of lord bottetourt lord dunmore was appointed to the government and he either from ignorance of the subject or other motives made a grant of some lands on the ohio to certain of his friends and favorites which produced the following letter from lord dartmouth who succeeded lord hilsborough as secretary of state  i think fit to enclose your lordship a copy of lord hilsboroughs letter to lord bottetourt of the   st of july    0 the receipt of which was acknowledged by mr president nelson a few days after lord bottetourts death and appears by his answer to it to have been laid before the council that board therefore could not be ignorant of what has passed here upon mr walpoles application nor of the kings express command contained in lord hilsboroughs letter that no lands should be granted beyond the limits of the royal proclamation of      until the kings further pleasure was signified and i have only to observe that it must have been a very extraordinary neglect in them not to have informed your lordship of that letter and those orders  on these documents i shall make no remarks they are their own evidence and show what the limits of virginia were while a british province and as there was then no other authority by which they could be fixed and as the grant to the london company could not be a grant to any but themselves and of consequence ceased to be when they ceased to exist it remained a matter of choice in the crown on its reassumption of the lands to limit or divide them into separate governments as it judged best and from which there was not and could not in the order of government be any appeal neither was virginia as a province affected by it because the moneys in any case arising from the sale of lands did not go into her treasury and whether to the crown or to the proprietors was to her indifferent and it is likewise evident from the secretarys letter and the presidents answer that it was in contemplation to lay out a new colony on the back of virginia between the allegany mountains and the ohio  having thus gone through the several charters or grants and their relation to each other and shown that virginia cannot stand in succession to a private grant which has been extinct for upwards of   0 years and that the western limits of virginia at the commencement of the revolution were at the heads of the rivers emptying themselves into the atlantic none of which are beyond the allegany mountains i now proceed to the second part namely  the reasonableness of her claims  virginia as a british province stood in a different situation with the crown of england to any of the other provinces because she had no ascertained limits but such as arose from the laying off new provinces and the proclamation of      for the name virginia as i have before mentioned was the general name of all the country and the dominion out of which the several governments were laid off and in strict propriety conformable to the origin of names the province of virgiginia was taken out of the dominion of virginia for the term dominion could not appertain to the province which retained the name of virginia but to the crown and from thence was applied to the whole country and signified its being an appendage to the crown of england as they now say our dominion of wales  it is not possible to suppose there could exist an idea that virginia as a british province was to be extended to the south sea at the distance of three thousand miles the dominion as appertaining at that time to the crown might be claimed to extend so far but as a province the thought was not conceiveable nor the practice possible and it is more than probable that the deception made use of to obtain the patent of   0  by representing the fouth sea to be near where the allegany mountains are was one cause of its becoming extinct and it is worthy of remarking that no history at least that i have met with mentions any dispute or litigation between the crown and the company in consequence of the extinction of the patent and the reassumption of the lands and therefore the negative evidence corroborating with the positive make it as certain as such a case can possibly be that either the company received a compensation for the patent or quitted it quietly ashamed of the imposition they had acted and their subsequent maladministration men are not inclined to give up a claim where there is any ground to contend on and the silence in which the patent expired is a presumptive proof that its fate from whatever cause was just  there is one general policy which seems to have prevailed with the english in laying off new governments which was not to make them larger than their own country that they might the easier hold them manageable this was the case with every one except canada the extension of whose limits was for the political purpose of recognizing new acquisition of territory not immediately convenient for colonization  but in order to give this matter a chance through all its cases i will admit what no man can suppose which is that there is an english charter that fixes virginia to extend from the atlantic to the south sea and contained within a due west line set off two hundred miles below cape comfort and a north west line set off two hundred miles above it her side then on the atlantic according to an explanation given in mr bradsords paper of september   th      by an advocate for the virginia claims will be four hundred miles her side to the south three thousand her side to the west four thousand and her north west line about five thousand and the quantity of land contained within these dimensions will be almost  000000000 that is four thousand million of acres which is more than ten times the quantity contained within the present united states and above an hundred rimes greater than the kingdom of england  to reason on a case like this is such a waste of time and such an excess of solly that it ought not to be reasoned upon it is impossible to suppose that any patent to private persons could be so intentionally absurd and the claim grounded thereon is as wild as any thing the imagination of man ever conceived  but if as i before mentioned there was a charter which bore such an explanation and that virginia stood in succession to it what would that he to us any more than the will of alexander had he taken it in his head to have bequeathed away the world such a charter or grant must have been obtained by imposition and a false representation of the country or granted in error or both and in any of or all these cases the united states must reject the matter as something they can know nothing of for the merits will not bear an argument and the pretention of right stands upon no better ground  our case is an original one and many matters attending it must be determined on their own merits and reasonableness the territory of the rest of the states is in general within known bounds of moderate extent and the quota which each state is to furnish toward the expense and service of the war must be ascertained upon some rule of comparison the number of inhabitants of each state formed the first rule and it was naturally supposed that those numbers bore nearly the same proportion to each other which the territory of each state did virginia on this scale would be about one fifth larger than pennsylvania which would be as much dominion as any state could manage with happiness and convenience  when i first began this subject my intention was to be extensive on the merits and concise on the matter of right instead of which i have been extensive on the matter of right and concise on the merits or reasonableness and this alteration in my design arose consequentially from the nature of the subject for as a reasonable thing the claim can be supported by no argument and therefore needs none to refute it but as there is a strange propensity in mankind to shelter themselves under the sanction of a right however unreasonable that supposed right may be i found it most conducive to the interest of the case to show that the right stands upon no better grounds than the reason and shall therefore proceed to make some observations on  the consequences of the claim  the claim being unreasonable in itself and standing on no ground of right but such as if true must from the quarter it is drawn be offensive has a tendency to create disgust and sour the minds of the rest of the states those lands are capable under the management of the united states of repaying the charges of the war and some of which as i shall hereafter show might i presume be made an immediate advantage of  i distinguish three different descriptions of lands in america at the commencement of the revolution proprietary or chartered lands as was the case in pennsylvania crown lands within the described limits of any of the crown governments and crown residuary lands that were without or beyond the limite of any province and those last were held in reserve whereon to erect new governments and lay out new provinces as appears to have been the design by lord hillsboroughs letter and the presidents answer wherein he says with respect to the establishment of a new colony on the back of virginia it is a subject of too great political imporportance for me to presume to give an opinion upon however permit me my lord to observe that when that part of the country shall become populated it may bea wise and prudent measure  the expression is a new colony on the back of virginia and referred to lands between the heads of the rivers and the ohio this is a proof that those lands were not considered within but beyond the limits of virginia as a colony and the other expression in the letter is equally descriptive namely we do not presume to say to whom our gracious sovereign shall grant his vacant lands certainly then the same right which at that time rested in the crown rests now in the more supreme authority of the united states and therefore addressing the presidents letter to the circumstances of the revolution it will run thus  we do not presume to say to whom the sovereign united states shall grant their vacant lands and with respect to the settlement of a new colony on the back of virginia it is a matter of too much political importance for me to give an opinion upon however permit me to observe that when that part of the country shall become peopled it may be a wise and prudent measure  it must occur to every person on reflection that those lands are too distant to be within the government of any of the present states and i may presume to suppose that were a calculation justly made virginia has lost more by the decrease of taxables than she has gained by what lands she has made sale of therefore she is not only doing the rest of the states wrong in point of equity but herself and them an injury in point of strength service and revenue  it is only the united states and not any single state that can lay off new states and incorporate them in the union by representation therefore the situation which the settlers on those lands will be in under the assumed right of virginia will be hazardous and distressing and they will feel themselves at last like alliens to the common wealth of israel their habitations unsafe and their title precarious  and when men reflect on that peace harmony quietude and security which is necessary to prosperity especially in making new settlements and think that when the war shall be ended their happiness and safety will depend on a union with the states and not a scattered people unconnected with and politically unknown to the rest they will feel but little inclination to put themselves selves in a sitnation which however solitary and recluse it may appear at present will then be uncertain and unsafe and their troubles will have to begin where those of the united states shall end  it is probable that some of the inhabitants of virginia may be inclined to suppose that the writer of this by taking up the subject in the manner he has done is arguing unfriendly against their interest to this he wishes to reply  that the most extraordinary part of the whole is that virginia should countenance such a claim for it is worthy of observing that from the beginning of the contest with britain and long after there was not a people in american who discovered through all the variety and multiplicity of public business a greater fund of true wisdom fortitude and disinterestedness than the then colony of virginia they were loved  they were reverenced their investigation of the assumed rights of britain had a sagacity which was uncommon their reasonings were piercing difficult to be equalled and impossible to be refuted and their public spirit was exceeded by none but since this unfortunate land scheme has taken place their powers seem to be absorbed a torpor has overshaded them and every one asks what is become of virginia  it seldom happens that the romantic schemes of extensive dominion are of any service to a government and never to a people they assuredly end at last in loss trouble division and disappointment and was even the title of virginia good and the claim admissible she would derive more lasting and real benefit by participating it than by attempting the management of an object so infinitely beyond her reach her share with the rest under the supremacy of the united states which is the only authority adaquate to the purpose would be worth more to her than what the whole would produce under the management of herself alone and that for several reasons  first because her claim not being admissible nor yet manageable she cannot make a good title to the purchasers and consequently can get but little for the lands secondly because the distance the settlers will be at from her will immediately put them out of all government and protection so far at least as relates to virginia and by this means she will render her frontiers a refuge to desperadoes and a hiding place from justice and the consequence will be perpetual unsafety to her own peace and that of the neighboring states thirdly because her quota of expense for carrying on the war admitting ber to engross such an immensity of territory would be greater than she can either support or supply and could not be less upon a reasonable rule of proportion than nine tenths of the whole and lasty because she must sooner or later relinquish them and therefore to see her own interest wisely at first is preferable to the alternative of finding it out by misfortune at last i have now gone through my examination of the claims of virginia in every case which i proposed and for several reasons wish the lot had fallen to another person  but as this is a most important matter in which all are interested and the substantial good of virginia not injured but promoted and as few men have leisure and still fewer have inclination to go into intricate investigation i have at last ventured on the subject  the succession of the united states to the vacant western territory is a right they originally sat out upon and in the pamphlet common sense i frequently mentioned those lands as a national fund for the benefit of all therefore resuming the subject where i then left off i shall conclude with concisely reducing to system what i then only hinted  in my last piece the crisis extraordinary i estimated the annual amount of the charge of the war and the support of the several governments at two millions pounds sterling and the peace establishment at three quarters of a million and by a comparison of the taxes of this country with those of england proved that the whole yearly expense to us to defend the country is but a third of what britain would have drawn from us by taxes had she succeeded in her attempt to conquer and our peace establishment only an eighth part and likewise showed that it was within the ability of the states to carry on the whole of the war by taxation without having recourse to any other modes or funds to have a clear idea of taxation is necessary to every country and the more funds we can discover and organize the less will be the hope of the enemy and the readier their disposition to peace which it is now their interest more than ours to promote  i have already remarked that only the united states and not any particular state can lay off new states and incorporate them in the union by representation keeping therefore this idea in view i ask might not a substantial fund be quickly created by laying off a new state so as to contain between twenty and thirty million of acres and opening a land office in all the countries in europe for hard money and in this country for supplies in kind at a certain price  the tract of land that seems best adapted to answer this purpose is contained between the allegany mountain and the river obio as far north as the pennsylvania line thence extending down the said river to the falls thereof thence due south into the latitude of the north carolina line and thence east to the allegany mountain aforesaid  i the more readily mention this tract because it is fighting the enemy at their own weapons as it includes the same ground on which a new colony would have been erected for the emolument of the crown of england as appears by lord hilsboroughs and dartmouths letters had not the revolution prevented its being carried into execution  it is probable there may be some spots of private property within this tract but to incorporate them into some government will render them more profitable to the owners and the condition of the scattered settlers more eligible and happy than at present  if twenty millions of acres of this new state be patented and sold at twenty pounds sterling per hundred acres they will produce four million pounds sterling which if applied to continental expenses only will support the war for three years should britain be so unwise to herself to prosecute it against her own direct interest and against the interest and policy of all europe the several states will then have to raise taxes for their internal government only and the continental taxes as soon as the fund begins to operate will lessen and if sufficiently productive will cease  lands are the real riches of all the habitable world and the natural funds of america the funds of other countries are in general artificially constructed the creatures of necessity and contrivance dependent upon credit and always exposed to hazard and uncertainty but lands can neither be annihilated nor lose their value on the contrary the universally rise with population and rapidly so when under the security of effectual government but this it is impossible for virginia to give and therefore that which is capable of defraying the expenses of the empire will under the management of any single state produce only a fugitive support to wandering individuals  i shall now enquire into the effects which the laying out a new state under the authority of the united states will have upon virginia  it is the very circumstance she ought to and must wish for when she examines the matter through all its cases and consequences  the present settlers being beyond her reach and her supposed authority over them remaining in herself they will appear to her as revolters and she to them as oppressors and this will produce such a spirit of mutual dislike that in a little time a total disagreement will take place to the disadvantage of both  but under the authority of the united states the matter is manageable and virginia will be eased of a disagreeable consequence  besides this a sale of the lands continentally for the purpose of supporting the expense of the war will save her a greater share of taxes than what the small sale she could make herself and the small price she could get for them would produce  she would likewise have two advantages which no other state in the union enjoys first a frontier state for her defense against the incursions of the indians and the second is that the laying out and peopling a new state on the back of an old one situated as the is is doubling the quantity of its trade  the new state which is here proposed to be laid our may send its exported own the missisippi but its imports must come through chesapeak bay and consequently virginia will become the market for the new state because though there is a navigation from it there is none into it on account of the rapidity of the missisippi  there are certain circumstances that will produce certain events whether men think of them or notes the events do not depend upon thinking but are the natural consequence of acting and according to the system which virginia has gone upon the issue will be that she will get involved with the back settlers in a contention about rights till they dispute with her her own claims and soured by the contention will go to any other state for their commerce both of which may be prevented a perfect harmony established the strength of the states increased and the expenses of the war derrayed by settling the matter now on the plan of a general right and every day it is delayed the difficulty will be increased and the advantages lessened  but if it should happen as it possibly may that the war should end before the money which the new state may produce be expended the remainder of the lands therein may be set apart to reimburse those whose houses have been burnt by the enemy as this is a species of suffering which it was impossible to prevent because houses are not moveable property and it ought not to be that because we cannot do every thing that we ought not to do what we can  having said thus much on the subject i think it necessary to remark that the prospect of a new fund so far from abating our endeavors in making every immediate provision for the supply of the army ought to quicken us therein for should the states see it expedient to go upon the measure it will be at least a year before it can be productive i the more freely mention this because there is a dangerous species of popularity which i fear some men are seeking from their constituents by giving them grounds to believe that if they are elected they will lighten the taxes a measure which in the present state of things cannot be done without exposing the country to the ravages of the enemy by disabling the army from defending it  where knowledge is a duty ignorance is a crime and if any man whose duty it was to know better has encouraged such an expectation he has either deceived himself or them besides no country can be defended without expense and let any man compare his portion of temporary inconveniences arising from taxations with the real distresses of the army for the want of supplies and the difference is not only sufficient to strike him dumb but make him thankful that worse consequences have not followed  in advancing this doctrine i speak with an honest freedom to the country for as it is their good to be defended so it is their interest to provide that defense at least till other funds can be organized  as the laying out new states will some time or other be the business of the country and as it is yet a new business to us and as the influence of the war has scarcely afforded leisure for reflecting on distant circumstances i shall throw together a few hints for facilitating that measure whenever it may be proper for adopting it  the united states now standing on the line of sovereignty the vacant territory is their property collectively but the persons by whom it may hereafter be peopled will have an equal right with ourselves and therefore as new states shall be laid off and incorporated with the present they will become partakers of the remaining territory with us who are already in possession and this consideration ought to heighten the value of lands to new emigrants because in making purchases they not only gain an immediate property but become initiated into the right and heirship of the states to a property in reserve which is an additional advantage to what any purchasers under the late government of england enjoyed  the setting off the boundary of any new state will naturally be the first stop and as it must be supposed not to be peopled at the time it is laid off a constitution must be formed by the united states as the rule of government in any new state for a certain term of years perhaps tea or until the state become peopled to a certain number of inhabitants after which the whole and sole right of modelling their government to rest with themselves  a question may arise whether a new state should immediately possess an equal right with the present ones in all cases which may corae before congress  this experience will best determine but at first view of the matter it appears thus that it ought to be immediately incorporated into the union on the ground of a family right such a state landing in the line of a younger child of the same stock but as new emigrants will have something to learn when they first come to america and a new state requiring aid rather than capl of giving it it might be most convenient to admit its immediate representation into congress there to sit hear and debate on all questions and matters but not to vote on any till after the expiration of seven years  i shall in this place take the opportunity of renewing a hint which i formerly threw out in the pamphlet common sense and which the several states will sooner or later see the convenience if not the necessicy of adopting which is that of electing a continental convention for the purpose of forming a continental constitution defining and describing the powers and authority of congress  those of entering into treaties and making peace they naturally possess in behalf of the states for their separate as well as their united good but the internal control and dictatorial powers of congress are not sufficiently defined and appear to be too much in some cases and too little in others and therefore to have them marked legally out will give additional energy to the whole and new confidence to the several parts
