rest is all but leather and prunella pope to the greatest coxcomb and most finished coquette living sir and madam it has long been and still remains a settled rule with authors to choose the most conspicuous characters for patrons thus far i comply with general custom which however ridiculous it is dangerous to break through as to the trite panegyrics of dedication they seem absolutely unnecessary upon the present occasion for your virtues  qualifications i mean are so very generally known that they require not any illustration being sufficient blazon to themselves therefore it will be sufficient to observe that to your great predecessors the drama is obliged for many of its most striking characters to you and your courtly tribe of imitators we stand indebted for the frequent curious amendments of fashion and machinations of love also for operas burlettas masquerades pantomimes drums routs with a long etc of timekilling amusements and last though not least in love for the following tale founded on your systems of life which circumstance must particularly recommend it to your most indulgent patronage  it is true i may appear in this address as an indian worshipping the devil however that may be it will evidently follow from one consideration that i have an undoubted right to claim your patronage when i declare that many actions of my own life have been truly coxcomical and perhaps not one of them more so than my compliance with the cacoethes scribendi which urged me to commence author especially a poetical or versifying one  i am with all due respect as a writer and sincere affection as relation  your most obedient and devoted servant the author i had almost dated this address april the first but being sensible that it was giving the critics a fair opportunity to honor me with the title of the day i step four and twenty hours forward in the year         advertisement to the public knowing from personal experience how apt prefatory matter is to pall i shall no farther intrude upon the leisure of my readers than briefly to observe that the following narration is founded on truth that it is related exclusive of an alteration in the catastrophe of narcissa with strict fidelity what merit there may be in it i shall leave the public to decide i am well apprized that the characters will seem somewhat imperfect particularly eliza who does not appear sufficiently to constitute a principal but i hope to be excused any error of this kind though voluntary as i found prolixity stealing in upon me which i was resolved at any rate to avoid  i should perhaps have thrown the incidents together in prose but that i think the town already too much harrassed with memoirs adventures etc this is a sort of deviation and i hope some persons of stronger genius than i imagine myself to be will communicate pictures of life in poetical narratives  upon the whole as i know many faults must appear i earnestly request that every judicious reader will make such amendments as seem necessary and render it if possible agreeable to his or her taste believing i should have done the same had it been in my power  london april        this day are

oerburthend mind the chains of rough adversity unbind then to forget myself i ask thy aid oh snatch me from the gloom of fortunes shade for tender fancy struggles hard to rise through the sharp gales and frosts of wintry skies bear from dull earth on thy expanded wing and teach thy humble proselyte to sing with sprightly elegance of thought inspire inflame my bosom with poetic fire strike with bold imagry and tune my verse while fabled truths a moral tale rehearse anselmo wearied with a trading life resolved to fly solicitude and strife to lay the anxious cares of business down and shun the bustle of the noisy town nature had mingled in anselmos frame a love of virtue and contempt of fame grave without pride though prudent not severe of honor boundless and of judgment clear to censure slow to pardon always free the friend of mankind and of liberty who could with equal honesty despise the fools of power or the corrupted wise a venal commoner or lordly knave a mitred deist or a willing slave a grapling miser or a spendthrift heir an impious rakehell or abandoned fair a shameless sinner or affected saint a mind of fallacy or face of paint fortune had blessed him with sufficient store and reason wisely told him seek no more he chose a lonely yet delightful seat where every comfort crowned the blessed retreat where joys unknown to pompous pride and power danced on the wings of every passing hour content the goddess of supreme delight still cheered the day and balmd the happy night here safe calm peace could smile at distant wars the cannons thunder and loud statesmens jars religion here divested of all art conjoined with reason to amend the heart just in her tenets in her doctrine clear placid in zeal not formally severe here charity in all her native charms called faint distress to her enlivening arms dispersed the cloud of woe with sunlike beams and scattered bounty in diffusive streams no widow here ever bootless told her pain no helpless orphan streamed with tears in vain anselmo had but one remaining care of which two daughters claimed an equal share the elder deemed beyond description fair narcissa so the lovely nymph we call in shape was delicate in stature tall her blooming cheeks made pale the tyrian dye and cupids ambushd in each sparkling eye with every glance flew forth a golden dart the certain conquest of a wounded heart her charms diffused a world of pleasing pains and fettered half mankind in amorous chains each public place reechod with her fame and thriving vintners blessed her lucky name for sons of bacchus holding her divine pouring libations emptid tons of wine to show his taste in panegyric lays each witling strove to celebrate her praise beaus with their taylors and their barbers aid for beaus are but mechanically made in foppish emulation vainly strove to catch the fair ones eye and win her love while she convinced of her extensive power studied to gain new conquests every hour a thousand little practiced arts she tries cupid the proteus of her varying eyes veiled in the ambush of their dazzling rays filled each beholder with an amorous blaze while she with pride beheld each subject swain with rapture saw and triumphed in his pain pale envy sat on every female brow to see those charms which envy must allow narcissas beauty rivals would not see but thus anatomized her over tea here one can plainly in complexion trace undoubted symptons of a borrowed face the next a dart of criticism throws against the disproportion of her nose a thirds sarcastic on her jetty hair a fourth discovers her immodest stare a fifth for not one atom can escape distorts maliciously her matchless shape a sixth to sum up all with heart elate descants at large upon her awkward gait thus feeble envy like a sable cloud which strives the suns enlivening rays to shroud labored tenvelop with its tainting shade the radiant beauties of this lovely maid but as the god of day triumphant reigns his beams unsullied with polluting stains thus shone the maid through scandals poisonous gloom in all the luster of meridian bloom though clogged with malice still she soared above hailed as the shrine of universal love no wonder if narcissa forced to leave the mart of beauty should reluctant grieve to yield the spoil of three coquetted years called forth the tribute of some pearly tears she wept she murmured at the hard decree so inconsistent with her gaiety she found no pleasure in the rural plains reflection suited not her want of brains for oh  though sad the truth we must declare this lovely maid so exquisitely fair whose sparkling eyes could joy or pain dispense wanted the attribute of commonsense and selfsufficient like all other fools still soared beyond the mean constraint of rules reasons sage dictates still she could resist and just had head enough to play at whist anselmo saw her levity with pain and often spoke but always spoke in vain she had been told a sire declined in age near to his exit from this mortal stage should not with antiquated rules control the modish sallies of a daughters soul the joys of boundless liberty she chose and looked on prudent friends as envious foes a fathers care her folly deemed his vice and called restraining love his avarice eliza sister to this witless thing this flimsey butterfly with gilded wing fell far beneath in the external part yet rose superior in an honest heart though nature furnished not those fleeting charms which sickness often but surely age disarms those eyedelighting beauties of an hour which one rough blast can instantly devour a mind to no unruly passion slave the great and just equivalent she gave in strict compliance did eliza move with filial piety and kindred love though youngest took a housewifes homely care nor would her sister ever deign to share received her fathers precepts as her guide and prudently a mothers place supplied domestics with her mild deportment won with emulation to their duty run the humble villagers who lived around from her good humor gentle treatment found with cheerful countenance she would resort to rural festivals and share their sport and sometimes gaily join as if by chance in the rude measures of the rustic dance while vain narcissa with disdainful brow from prides high throne oerlookd the poor below scarce had anselmo been three months at rest three little months with solitude been blessed when this unthinking object of his love tormented her fond parent to remove to quit the country for the gayer town where various pleasures various minutes crown where as she said there are a thousand ways as drums and balls and masquerades and plays to plume with joy the drooping wings of time and waft direct to happiness sublime thou know my child replies the tender sire i still have gratified each fond desire review thy scanty catalogue of years behold my tenderness my anxious fears when did thou task my utmost power in vain did thou ever singly feel or joy or pain why woudst thou then a wished repose deny to see a father happy do thou sigh why sits that moody frontlet on thy brow does gratitude thy discontent allow think my narcissa of thy wild demand nor seek for ruin at anselmos hand if my indulgence let thy spirits roam discretion urges me to call em home life natures turbulent and dangerous sea is formed of complicate variety here wanton sunbeams on smooth waters play and all within the calm horizons gay but farther on a furious tempest roars while watery mountains burst on trembling shores ten thousand shoals and rocks in ambush wait the secret sudden ministers of fate youths fragile barks with silken tackle ride on the smooth stream of follys faithless tide unnumberd prospects of delusion glare which lead into the eddies of despair vice guiding rash adventurers along to fate allures them with her siren song experience only can through dangers steer and wisely with the turns of fortune veer then slight not the affection that would save thy tender youth from fates oerwhelming wave anselmo here gave admonition over narcissa wearied long had wish no more her flighty soul could modishly despise the prudent hints of being sometimes wise and all the knowledge which her father taught a tedious tasteless homily she thought not long she grieved at her eclipsing state her freedom came upon the wing of fate for six revolving moons had scarcely past before the good anselmo breathed his last in a malignant fevers deadly guise pale atropos sealed up her fathers eyes while on the bed of gloomy death he lay in all the agony of swift decay his eyes overflowing with affections tide to see his daughters mourning by his side he snatched from vast eternity and prayer a few short moments for his worldly care spoke all the precepts of a happy life adapted to the maiden and the wife and recommended with his dying voice untainted virtue as the wisest choice a strict compliance with her laws required then sunk at once and blessing them expired this fatal chance this unexpected dart shot pains unnumberd through elizas heart her breast full fraught with loves abundant store in bursting groans reecchod he is no mre ye nymphs and swains in solemn chorus join and let your voices catch the tone of mine let me deprived of comforts cheering beam let me instruct your pious eyes to stream for none like me the mighty loss can tell how many virtues with anselmo fell weep weep ye indigent your bosoms rend like me you have lost a father and a friend in such sad wailings her affection spoke her filial sorrow for the fatal stroke narcissa marblehearted to all woe but such as could from disappointment flow she who had never ministerd relief who never was gloomd but with a selfish grief even she vouchsafed some pious tears to shed natures last tribute to a parent dead but soon the cloud of fleeting care gave way when sighed for pleasures beamed their dazzling ray fresh conquests danced before her raptured view she longed her lost dominion to renew and fortune joined with inclination here to give that liberty she held so dear for upon fates unalterable page she stood recorded of a legal age no guardians sage impertinence she fears to rule the conduct of discretions years and on a careful scrutiny she found her portion counted twice ten thousand pound winged with the gold she took a sudden flight and quickly gained the region of delight london dear london that bewitching place that happy market for a lovely face london the seat of industry and play london the great the populous and gay london possessed of worthies and of knaves of every clime and each degree but slaves london where trade and lighter pleasures smile london the pride the glory of this isle narcissa blessed with absolute command sets up an equipage with lavish hand her splendor more than former fame restores each milliner admires each fop adores the brilliant fair all connoisseurs confess the soul of fashion and the life of dress two years a life of elegance she led passed nights in revelry and days in bed suitors unnumberd pleaded love sincere but none with titles suited to her ear she thought her boundless charms might justly claim some honorable prelude to her name your ladyship  no no a higher place hail me kind fortune with the title grace this was the constant subject of her care her sole remaining wish and only prayer for though she went to church each sabbath day her business was to ogle not to pray at length fate joined to her admiring train the wished for conquest of a lorded swain the gay camillo master of those arts which serve to triumph over coquetish hearts who though in parliament he always sat a perfect monosyllable of state in politics a very harmless peer in love still thundered on with bold career through each degree of galantry he roved and now a countess then a milkmaid loved with equal ardour flew at any game for high and low possessed an equal flame while fortune still throughout his amorous round the noble peer with countless conquests crowned nor should we wonder at his boundless reign no less his happy attributes could gain for though the knowledge of this titled prig could climb but to a fashionable wig though books he little knew and virtue less he was an adept in the art of dress his clothes were glaring he could dance and game swear fawn and lie untouched with conscious shame to these a paltry cunning we may add which showed a worthless head and heart as bad he saw the failings of narcissas mind to all the dictates of discretion blind at cards he watched the motions of her soul and saw her variegated passions roll saw gay success her lovely face embloom and disappointment all her beauties gloom with love of play he joined her boundless pride and craftily appointed them his guide by their assistance he resolved to move and humble this proud citadel of love his scheme proposed at length the siege began the lady too had formed a previous plan and all the motions of each side confess both parties well acquainted with finesse he still approached in loves sincerest guise she played thartillery of sparkling eyes he breathed his vows with a pathetic grace she deigned to listen with a smiling face and then was most particularly gay when he politely lost his stakes at play much time elapsed without a conquest gained for both alike invincible remained narcissa would have yielded as a wife but then camillo loved a single life while matters thus remained in dubious sense and both were almost wearied with suspense misfortune which too often will prevail cast a large balance in his lordships scale narcisssa rising from her bed one morn gay as those beams which eastern hills adorn successive pleasures justling in her brain found the gay prospect of idea vain and with a sudden shock of ruthless fate fell from the glory of her dazzling height a letter came supposed the sacrifise of some poor swain the captive of her eyes she cried  a lady fanciful in mind  oh wherefore was i born to plague mankind with gentle indolence she broke the seal unknowing what her vanity must feel when lo in fatal characters she read that bankrupt philo her trustee was fled that with her fortune all her hopes were dead amaze and madness trembled in her face and crowding passions gave each other chase first silent horror took its chilly reign and icicled her blood through every vein her shuddring limbs an aguish soul confessed then climbing rage enflamed her tender breast at last the thundercloud of nature breaks in briny torrents down her pallid cheeks in hopes to mitigate her raging pain at intervals she read her fate again but where the unhappy fair one sought relief she met the confirmation of her grief four restless days and sleepless nights she passed and wished each woe fraught minute was her last a crowd of visitors approached her door yet unacquainted with her being poor but all the servants were desired to tell each courtly friend their lady was not well a thousand cards of compliments there came in language and sincerity the same perplexed narcissa no asylum knew through the mazed labyrinth of thought she flew but no kind hope its cheering beam would show through the dark cloud of her obscuring woe thus hunted by misfortune to a bay distraction led and she pursued the way resolved by desprate means to keep her state or fall a victim of relentless fate so acts the lordly tyrant of the wood when hunters seek to revel in his blood a dangerous unequal fight he tries and lives triumphant or triumphant dies the fair unfortunate her stock looked over and found two hundred guineas all her store on this small pittance strait she sallied out with eager haste to lady gamewells route in all the splendour of an eastern bride and her false spirits decked in falser pride each told how much her absence had been mourned and complimented on her health returned but above all camillo vowed his pain and said that joy returned with her again to cards in parties all with speed retired each bosom with a love of gain inspired here eager hope appears in eager eyes see in one trick the gay delusion flies there angry looks dark discontent betray one luckless card can strike with pale dismay now some with jocund hearts their bets receive while those who lose with trembling fingers give a general silence ruled external parts yet various tumults reigned in various hearts fortune reviews their anxious fears and wiles and justly at the mad assembly smiles yet undetermined where success to bring sometime she fluttered on a dubious wing at length by accident she chanced to light blessing narcissa with a golden flight five hundred guineas with harmonious notes beyond the warblings of italian throats chinkd in her ears and to thenlivning sound her newborn spirits beat a nimble round her joyfilld eyes looked eminently gay and though unrested rivaled rising day camillo saw the transports of her breast and with mean art a sympathy professed swore her success much greater pleasure gave than any flow of fortune he could have vowed her content superior to his own and that her joys to him were joys alone then proudly ushered the victorious fair and led the way to her attending chair requested leave to visit her at home she smiled assent and told him he might come now all departing to their beds retreated both those with conquest crowned and those defeated but different fortunes different vigils kept and hardly one of either party slept here rest was murdered in the losers pain there conquered by exhilerating gain true to the touch that day his lordship came to paint his inextinguishable flame narcissa on precarious footing placed thought it imprudent to be coyly c h ste therefore politically cast aside affected levity and distant pride therefore with grave attention heard his tale convinced her eyes must certainly prevail convinced the lover to escape his pains would nooze himself in matrimonial chains each day he visited each day she thought the period of advancement nearer brought but ah weak maid in all her projects vain love struck her heart without a sense of pain love of the gay deceiver gently stole and unperceived enthralled her roving soul the sigh affected once sincerely heaves camillo flatters and narcissa blieves when he beheld the captive in his power he villainously seized a pliant hour when powerful nature bore imperial sway and her dilated mind was freely gay then with the force of stimulative art enfeebld reason and enflamed her heart down with false vows her struggling virtue bore enjoyed his utmost wish and sighed no more then left her hastily with cold respect lothario like at leisure to reflect this was narcissas era of distress her little comfort grew each moment less tortured with love and disappointed hope she gave the fury of her madness scope wild as a tempest of the north she raved and from avenging heaven assistance craved while her gallant divulged to babbling fame the secret of his villainy  her shame his dauntless infamy remorse defies and the black tale on blacker scandal flies in one short day through thousands swiftly goes a standing jest for prudes coquets and beaus hastes to the knowledge of the grubstreet throng and strait becomes the subject of a song thus the bewitching but uncautious maid by fortune and by fallacy betrayed rent with the rage of agonizing thought when past the nine days wonder of her fault was metamorphosd as by magic spell and to the shade of dark oblivion fell approaching penury again assailed which with lost fame over penitence prevailed another lover she at length obtained and he too shortly all his wishes gained then soon revolted from her fading charms and left for others her incircling arms a third a fourth succeeded and were blessed but each one proved inconstant as the rest thus half a bedlamite through shame she ran the justly irritated foe of man to vice a captive and afraid to think took the sad refuge of oblivious drink in bacchanalian chains her reason bound thus sealed her ruin thus destruction crowned for soon her blooming beauty felt decay and with her charms subsistence dropped away yet to the last her follies she pursued till dreaded poverty at length ensued till she was placed by fates relentless power where human wretchedness could fall no lower prosperity here turn thy sparkling eye and view the ravage of adversity see desolation spread over every part glare in her eyes and rankle in her heart see those soft limbs which in full fortune wore the richest produce of each trading shore for maintenance their gaudy raiment fold  now and shivering with the cold  that nice palate with rich viands fed enjoy the simple sustenance of bread with no dilution to imbibe when dry but such as springs and friendly streams supply see her beneath a dropping penthouse creep there in sad exigence behold her sleep a damp uncomfortable stone her bed and the rude pillow of her houseless head that soul which lightest trifles could affright sleeps in the horrors of a winters night though hurricanes the face of heaven deform sleeps in the tumult of the raging storm tell thy gay minions of their empty pride borne on the waves of fortunes golden tide how near mortalitys allied to woe in the sad prospect of narcissa show see that wrecked form so late admired by all see her distress and tremble at her fall eliza whom we have so long forgot on lifes vast stage had found a milder lot we meet her settled in a rural life a tender mother and a prudent wife though she too lost her patrimonial right discretion guarded her against fortunes spite for by the help of industry she gained a mansion where contentment ever reigned where neatness shone beyond a splendid glare and void of grandeur it was void of care narcissas stubborn pride though fallen so low disdained to let her tender sister know the tragic story of her matchless woe often had eliza wrote but still in vain her love could never friendly answer gain removed from town she knew not what had past but the sad tidings reached her ears at last winged on affection swift as fleeting thought to town she flew and poor narcissa sought from street to street incessantly she went yet a long week in fruitless searches spent at length the object of her care she found in wretched state upon the flinty ground struck with the sight immovable she stood while horror shame and anguish thrilled her blood soon as speech triumphed over the bonds of grief look up she cried i come to give relief come wretched sister from the earth arise at this narcissa raised her languid eyes dropped a few silent tears let fall her head while in a sigh her shattered spirit fled eliza thought twas only strength that failed she knew not that tyrannic death prevailed but soon was told that his unerring dart had pierced incurably her sisters heart convinced no care no human power could save with pious tears she wet narcissas grave then hasted homeward to her humble seat to taste the comforts of her calm retreat there still remains contented there to live on those enjoyments heaven is pleased to give nor does her humble gratitude aspire and cultivate irregular desire no idle wishes envious poison mix unmoved she views a neighbors coachandsix behold her ye narcissas of the age who gayly flutter on lifes transient stage to imitate her virtues be your care prefer a perfect mind to grandeurs glare for she that is best is fairest of the fair finis
