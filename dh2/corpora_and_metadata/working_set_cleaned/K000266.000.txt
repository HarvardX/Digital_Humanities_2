the diet of poland a satyr considered paragraph by paragraph to which is added a key to the whole with the names of the author and the nobility and gentry that are scandalously pointed at in it  rode caper vitem tamen hinc cum stabis ad aras in tua quod fundi cornua possit erit ovid london printed and sold by ben bragg at the blueball in avemarylane in the year   0   the preface as poland lies almost in the same latitude with england so the character the poet has here given of the poles seems so exactly to match what some illnatured people have said of some in enland that he easily foresees this censorious age will be apt to misjudge him as if he had some oblique meaning and that this was a satyr levelled at some people nearer home han the castle of warsaw  to foresee an accident and not endeavor to be prepared against it is a piece of policy peculiar to an author that sets up to reform the errors of petty statsmen three times a week to no purpose and it adds very much to a malefactors conviction to be guilty of a willful crime wherefore he had better either to have kept his foresight to himself or stifled his poem before he had sent it abroad to the great abuse of himself and the patriots he has taken the freedom to characte as for his skill in poetry if it was no better than his knowledge in geography he might have spared the trouble of a preface to the reader since there is so great a difference between london and warsaw in their latitude that he first is lon       lat       the last lon      lat       but the author humbly hopes all such inuendomen will consider that as they can have no reason to think so but similitude of characters so no conjectures of theirs ought to prejudge his meaning in which he demands to be left to himself and expects to be understood in the following poem as he speaks not as every prejudiced man may imagine he meant  how any man can humbly hope that has the arrogance to say he can be charged with nothing but similitude of characters is beyoud the reach of my understanding and if he has not done by the gentlemen whom he has injuriously treated as well as those whose reputation is blasted with his commendation as if he had actually written down their christian and sir names in capital letters then i have no claim to any such thing as common apprehension  if any are so weak to tell us that smithfield and cheapside cannot be meant of poland the author presumes to ask such people if ever they have been at warsaw and if they have and dont know that there is both a smithfield and a cheapside as well as a mayfair and a beargarden he is sorry for their heads and desires them to step thither again to reform their memories  poland may have places put to the same uses as smithfield and cheapside and fairs and beargardens may be in request there but it is none of his business to bring english transactions upon the polish theater and any man of compassion has very great reason to be sorry for his head who thinks to conceal what was printed near bartholomewclose under the sorry artifice of an impression from dantzick  but suppose there are not places called directly by those names if there are places applied to the same uses what has any body to question the allegories a poor author must never write at all if he is not at liberty to chose his metaphors and all the rest of the necessary figures of speech to help out his expression  he has forgot his trial at the old bailey for writing the shortest way with the dissenters or he would never insist upon an authors liberty to choose what metaphors he thinks fit for though he did not pay so dearly for his beloved ironies as he deserved yet the sentence then passed on him by the bench might have had such an effect upon his temper as not to make him uneasy but when he was breaking through the bonds he was engaged in to the government in being tied up to his good behavior  if it is alleged that there is too great an affinity in the story  he answers if that be true he is sorry for it but at the same time he hopes not and the matter of fact ought to be proved before he stands censured for calumny  though the character of the persons his satyr points at are false and malicious yet they bear so near a resemblance to what is said of them by their enemies of the dissenting party that the scandal is fixed beyond an excuse and ought to be ammadverted upon with the utmost severity unless the gentlemen in power close with the libeller and fling off all deference and respect for the memories of their predecessors  it is very hard that a man cannot write of the follies of other nations but people will be always comparing them with their own one would have thought the author had traveled far enough to find out histories and odd passages to divert us but if neither china poland nor the inhabitants of the moon will protect folks from being hanged as the frenchmen said for tinking go on gentlemen and if the cap fits any body let em wear it you are welcome to say these polish grandees represent englishmen but look to it ye sons of censure that can swear to a mans meaning and know his inside without the help of his outside for if the people your profoundity pretends to describe are affronted the action of slander lies against you and not the anthor in the writing it is a poem you in the reading turn it into a libel and you merit the punishment for the metamorphosis  an ingennous confession of the author who would be thought to take the pains of concealing himself if neither china poland nor the inhabitants of the moon will protect folks from being hanged etc your humble servant mr daniel foe you might as well have given us your name at large for every one knows who wrote the consolidator and as to your meaning they must be men of profound stupidity indeed that cannot find it out by your gaping you are so intelligible your self amongst your want of understanding so that the scandal will be laid at your door who made it a libel not at your readers who finds it as such  perhaps there is a sort of affinity among the vicious part of mankind in all countries and climates and the author doubts not he should have run the same risque of misconstruction had he wrote this at paris as at london that he should have been summoned before the court of honor for libelling the princes of the blood the sorbonne or the counselors of parliament it is very hard it should  there and here too  had such a piece of scurrility dared to show its face at paris the author of it would scarce have had his heels at  during life and if some people whom it concerns  of this nature would but perform those duties  to the well being of the government he may chance to meet with none of the civilest treatment in london for his impudence since no term can be too opprobri  thinks no appellation bitter enough against  directrs of the publk affairs who act contrary to the methods  prescribe to them  since then this is the fate of authors and he must expect it he submits but desires however that these unchristian censurers will take this along with them and so make a virtue of their want of charity that wherever the similitude of character pinches them too close they would prevent the severity of the application by reforming the likeness the satyr would then have the desired effect viz by drawing the imaginary picture of outlandish devels really transform our own  the fate of an author that casts such a reproach on the church and government established ought not to terminate in a scotch casement but he that has offered up a hymn to the pillory and made it clap its wooden wings for joy at the reception of its new tenant would not be much lamented if the three legged tree a mile and a half out of town should pay him the same compliment since it is not his readers want of charity but his own that renders him criminal  nor do i apprehend the world will be less solicitous about who is the author of this some perhaps will guess one some another and the hawkers they tell me will according to custom cry it about the street in the famous name of daniell de foe and though they might as well guess it was wrote by the man in the moon yet i am content he or any body else should go away with the credit of it it is enough that i am out of the reach of the polish resentments and cannot be prosecuted by the cardinal primate most of the persons here touched at being his friends and all of them in his interest and as for the world they may do their worst  i am their vnconcerned humble servant anglipoloski of luthuania  when an outrage is committed it is but natural to be in quest of the person that caused it and it will not be difficult without the assistance of the hawkers who are more at his service than his handmaids the nine muses to find that this label is not without sufficient grounds for so doing charged with a name those profane throats are incessantly piercing our ears with which may prove his being out of the reach of the polish resentments to be a more chimara and false suggestion for though the ecclesiastical authority may not take him to task he may be grinded to powder by the secular arm which he must own himself obnoxious to notwithstanding his borrowed name of anglipoloski  the diet of poland a satyr etc in northern climes where furious tempests blow and men more furious raise worse storms below at natures elbow distant and remote happy for europe had she been forgot the worlds proboscis near the globes extremes for barbarous menrenownd and barbarous names there poland lies too much her makers care and shares the moderate blessings of the air just as far off from heaven as we are here those must be furious men indeed that can outbluster boreas and how any thing can be at natures elbow and yet distant and remote at the same time requires the nicest determination natures backside would have done as well every jot but it is a paw word as the observator tells his countryman roger and must be flung aside for being uncourtly the worlds proboscis too is altogether new and just minted why not great toe as well for he that gave the world a nose gave it likewise feet to stand upon or it is creation would be imperfect  under the artick circle of the sky where virtues streams run low and natures high for heat of clime too far of blood too nigh tempered for plenty plenteously supplied with men advanced in every grace but pride a mighty nation throngs the groaning land rude as the climate numerous as the sand uncommon monstrous virtues they possess strange odd prepostrous polish qualities mysterious contraties they reconcile the pleasing frown and the destroying smile precisely gay and most absurdly grave most humbly high and barbarously brave debauchdly civil and profanely good and filled with generous brave ingratitude by bouny disobliged by hatred won bold in their danger cowards when it is gone to their own ruin they are the only tools wary of knaves and easily choused by fools profoundly empty yet declardly wise and fond of blind impossibilities swess d with conceit they boast of all they do first praise themselves than think that praise their due so fond of flattering words so vain in pride the world mocks them and they the world deride value themselves upon their nations merit in spite of all the vices they inherit so wedded to the country where they dwell they think that is heaven and all the world s a hell their frozen vistula they would not forgo for fruitful danube or the flowery po rapid boristhenes delights them more than pearly streams or a peruvian shore and russian dwina dwells upon their song hurried by barbarous steeps and hills and pusht along he must be well read in natural philosophy that makes natures streams run higher northwardly and in the coldest climates thn in those that are many degrees nearer to the sun as the western parts etc and since he has given nature an elbow does very poetically as well as modestly in describing her more virginum to make water by the means of that instrument for it is not to be imagined whence her streams issue unless from thence that pride is a grace is likewise wonderfully novel and how they can want that grace when in the same paragraph they are swelled with conceit and be va in pride is a riddle requires an oedipus to explain it neither are the two last lines the most sensible mr foe has written in his life though they are very musical to the ear for it is a manifest contradiction to make the dwina dwell upon their song which is an act of stagnation at the same time it is hurried i e precipitated and pushed along by barbarous steeps and hills  the land too happy would the people bless could they agree to know their happiness nature with very liberal hand supplies her situationinsufficiencies the temperate influence revolves of course and spite of climate nature works by force the bounteous spring the winters wast repairs and make the world grow young in spite of years the fruitful earth uncommon freedom shows and foreign wealth by foreign commerce flows now dame nature makes use of her hand as well as her elbow and gives amends for her situation insufficiencies but how so the climate was tempered for plenty in the second paragraph and now its so far from it that nature is forced to interpose and act as we do unnaturaly by forcing the growth of plants etc by hot beds for my part it never entered into my noddle how nature could work by force till this author gave it me in the affirmative  but peopled with a hardened thankless race whose crimes add horror to the milder place the bounties by indulgent heaven bestowed corrode the mischief and debauch the blood that native fierceness which in christian lands makes heroes and their poets praise commands here is a vice which rankles up to fewd and nourishes the gust of vile ingratitude pride plentys handmaid deeply taints their blood and seeds of faction mix the crimson flood eternal discords brood upon the soil and universal strifes the state embroil in every family the temper reigns in every action seed of gall remains the very laws of peace create dispute and makes them quarrel who shall execute their valued constitutions are so lame that governing they governments inflame wild aristocracy torments the state and people their own miseries create to corrode a mischief is in my sense to lessen it which is far from having any analogy to debauching the blood that is to increase it and then again to say that native fierceness which makes heroes and poets in christian countries here it is a vice and rankles up to fewd is false grammar with reverence to his dictatorship who sets up for the difficult resolver and impropriety fider among the class of authors besides my historians tell me though they are not of the leyden edition and printed cum notis variorum that poland is a christian country which he seems not to allow here  in vain has heaven its choicer gifts bestowed and strives in vain to do a willful nation good such is the peoples folly such their fate as all decrees of peace anticipate immortal jarrs in every class appear conceived in strife and nursed to civil war to make heaven strive in vain looks also a little impious in an author of this gentlemans pretenses to religion and to let it be anticipated in its decrees of peace can fall under no other apellation than that of blasphemy  such poland is thy people such thy name yet still thy sons our panegyricks claim because their partial genius is inclined to think they merit more than all mankind that is such is thy people poland and such thy name i e poland and what of all this where is the harm of polands being called poland a spades a spade and a bandbox will be a bandbox to the end of the chapter yet still they love praise and who does not as the vice chancellor who anfwerd a master of arts that gave in for his reasons of denying a certain scholar his degree that he loved a girl by the known response of quis non what man is without a natural affection to a pretty females  imaginary happiness will do for near as many uses as the true and if the poles in their own plagues delight wise heavens too just to let them thrive in spite his philosophy is none of the best whatever the cadence of his poetry is for that imaginary happiness can serve for near as many uses as true neither aristotle or des carts has yet laid down for an axiom in ethics  great sobieski had their crown obtained with steady glory thirthen years he reigned and none but who some mischief meant complained his conquering sword made all men think it fit that he who saved the land should govern it the field of battle he had first possessed by sixty thousand slaughtered turks confessed the fattend frontiers felt the reeking flood and died the soil with asiatick blood the weeping neister half the host receives hurries them down to darker euxine graves and mahomets insulting banners lay beneath the cross his valors easy prey now he begins to fall into particulars and by great sobieski must be meant k w who reigned over us thirteen years and who conquered ireland in person and by his generals after the loss of sixty thousand french and irish that sided with the unfortunate king james  with mild and gentle but with steady hand he rather led than ruled the uneasy land filled with important cares he saw their fate and all the growing mischiefs their own feuds create which made him less repine and less deplore to quit the crown with such concern he wore he rather led than ruled very pretty truly and emphaticaly that is he seemed rather a captain than a king dux suit non rex as if leading an army was not to rule it  tell us ye sons of policy and fraud whose vast intrigues your selves alone applaud who always plot too deep and soar too high and damn the nations peace you know not why what ailed the poles with peace and plenty blessed to change for years of blood their days of rest describe the men of avarice and pride with all ambitions dark disguise arrayed how for the nations liberty they cant till those they say abuse it they supplant and then the mock pretended sham lay by pleased with the profits of authority he might have spared himself the question of what ailed the poles etc when if he would but have looked into the partition treaty which was signed and brought about by a minister of state he now professes so great a regard for he had been satisfied without an enquiry and if he would fasten upon any one of the country party for taking of places after they had railed at men in offices we can give him two of the c  side etc for one without any more to do by way of exchange if d  and h  are sufficient to balance accounts with him  statesmen are gamesters sharp and tricks the play kings are but cullies wheedld in to pay the courtiers footballs kicked from one to one are always cheated oftentimes undone besieged with flattery false report and lies and soothed with schemes of vast absurdities the jangling statesmen clash in their designs fraud fights with fraud and craft to craft inclines stiffly engage quarrel accuse and hate and strive for leave to help undo the sat for all the strong contention ends in this who shall the power of doing ill possess envy and strife are only raised so high because a mans a greater knave than i but if i can his place and wealth succeed he rails of course and i am the knave indeed places and pensions are the polish spoil will all sides please and all sides reconcile it is natural to all the sons of men to rail and plot when out be quiet in if all the strife and contention for offices and places of trust be for obtaining the power of doing ill then those in authority must of consequence do ill which is but an odd compliment to the present administration and takes off very much from the character he bestows upon the l  h  t  and mr s  t  y  h  y under the names of casimir and the dyets marshall and if kings are cullys footballs and wheedled into pay he has done augustus no manner of service in giving him that inglorious title and here i cannot agree with some people who will have augustus to be the type of q  a  for an author could not be so unmannerly as to represent a fortunate princess and immovable in her principles by the name of one who has not only changed his religion for a crown but has ruined his hereditary dominions being as it were under a state of exile at this juncture but authors are inscrutable in their reasons and i leave him to explain himself on this head to such as he shall think fit to impart the secret to  long had divided poland felt the smart of vast intrigues and politicians art as many men of character and blood so many thieves about the scepter stood as many gifts the exhausted prince could give so many friends he only seemed to have the craving wretches hung about the throne he gave them all the nations wealth and all his own that there were thieves about the throne in the late reign well not dispute but he that has been so free with the names of such as have shared in the direction of public affairs in this might have given us theirs had they not been his particular friends and favoureits i never heard the prince he reflects upon gave away all his wealth to these craving wretches if he had there had been no dispute between the king of prussia and prince of friez land about the immense riches he left behind him  not all the conquered lands the turk resigned not all the world had he the world obtained would their insatiate avarice suffice supply their hands or satisfy their eyes who shall unhappy sinking poland save what gifts can close the hands that always crave unsatisfid as death and greedy as the grave at every just refusal discontent and rave for want of bribes at government the turk that is k j who abdicated  what a respectful title does he give her majestys royal father and suffice their avarice is a peculiarity of phrase i never heard of before but this i have to say for him when he turns plagiary he makes bold with his own works as thinking nothing that belongs to others worthy of being taken from them but their reputations witness unsatisfied as death and greedy as the grave which are applied to the saints favorite sir r  cl  ton in his satyr called the reformation  the valiant sobieski had bestowed moldavian lands he conquered by his sword he thought it just that province to bestow on those whose valor helped to make it so but all the wiser men who had no share against the justice of the gift declare oblige the yielding hero to recant and rebestow the hasty envied grant by moldavia is meant ireland and if the members of parliament whom he owns to be the wiser passed an act for resuming the grants of the forfeited estates in that kingdom then he must allow himself to be false in his character when he speaks of them in another style sometime after and if the grant was allowed to be hastily they are not to be blamed who considerately pressed his late majesty to rebestow it on the public  but tell us now ye men of polish wit how the moldavian feels the formal cheat let a  leski reimburse the bribes ravished to wrong instate the polish tribes let all the sham conveyances appear the phantosme sales and fancied purchaser let some true satyr all the grievance lash lands without title buyers without cash under the weighty fraud moldavia bleeds and private cheat the public cheat succeeds retrieving laws by vast designs pushed on cover great sobieski s errors by their own here he takes matters upon trust by giving credit to a few irish petitions for the parliament if he means the proceedings of the trustees for the forfeited estates since a  leski i e mr annesly was one in that commission have passed a vote in their favor which is a sufficient argument that they  not part with the lands they were empowered to sell to the buyer without cash  with all these frauds and feuds and millions more which racked the injured poles and kept them poor wife sobieski with strong cares oppressed dismissed the throne and chose to be at rest embroiled he left them whom embroiled he found and great augustus with his powrs enthroned dismissed the throne may be an elegancy with him but cannot with a judicious reader who will conclude death dismissed k w from the throne neither is it a very great compliment to a kings memory whom he would play the panegyrist upon to affirm that he left us embroiled since the world is not without people who make very odd reflections upon his last will and testament  in vain the new crowned monarch strives to please or cure the hereditary vile disease in vain confedrates with the nations friends in vain their laws and freedom he defends the parties join in grand cabals they meet the monarchs healing projects to defeat grasp at his gifts and share the high reward but not his honor or commands regard not sacred oaths can their allegiance bind farther than by their interest they are inclined prompted by avarice and deep revenge with fawning face and awkward zeal they cringe but all that can no royal bounty share their factious thoughts and strong disgusts declare no bounds their feigned allegance can secure to day they will swear to morrow they will abjure never did any prince come to the crown with a more general satisfaction of the party he points at than her majesty and the very persons he is so lavish of his invectives against were those who rejoiced at the turn of affairs both in church and state as to their endeavors to defeat the monarchs healing project they were such as advised it to be carried on and for swearing to day and abjuring to morrow that flies in the face of the pretenders to moderation equaly with theirs who seem realy disposed for it  the monarch willing to dissolve the feud that spread too fast in their infected blood summons the general diet to appear the nations and his own demands to hear the parliament was then sitting when queen anne succeeded to the throne so that she could not be said to call them together having met before to consider of the arduous affairs of the kingdom  satyr look back survey the glorious roll the life of polish power the nations soul polands collection all the peoples breath the monarchs safety and the tyrants death the ancient lords of the jagellan line here in their representing glory shine with loyal hearts and strong industrous hands ready to hear augustus great commands the ancient polish greatness to restore assist with council and support with power to say that the ancient lords of the jagellan line whose titles were hereditary doubtless shine in their representing glory seems somewhat like an absurdity for our accounts hitherto tell us the house of peers constitute two estates of parliament and the people of england that is the inferior estate are represented by the commons the monarchs safety and the tyrants death squints likewise at their old practice of decollation which the party he is advocate for has no small veneration for the memory of at their cruel festivals on the anniversary of her majestys royal grandfathers martyrdom  what though among the illustrious troop there is found some less polite than some and some unsounds the devil among the sacred twelve appeared but devils once known are no more to be feared the general votes to loyalty incline and mischief sinks beneath her own design satyr if there is a pole among the tribes less true than truth it self it is him thy verse describes the devil under no capacity is to be feared but god whom the scripture exhorts us to the fear of and if he was to describe all that were less true than truth it self i question whether if the whole kingdom were to be numbered notwithstanding his boasted perspicuity he could find one for god is truth it self and only the divine being worthy of that attribute  here great taguski first in order came of bright unspotted though suspected fame youth had supplied his head with parent wit in judgment solid and in sense complete the muses him with early garlands crowned sublime in verse and in his phrase profound polite in language in his satyr strong yet kills with all the softness of a song to steady justice all his thoughts incline faithful in council able in design raised by due merit to the highest trust the captious senate owned that merit just what cannot high exalted virtue do he shows this strange unusual wonder true the monarch s favorite and the peoples too his enemies to his just praise submit fly from his satyr and adore his wit in vain they form impolitick designs envy lies buried in her deepest mines for both sides own this characters his due always to poland and augustus true by the character of taguski though it infinitely falls short of him we may perceive some lineaments belonging to the l  h  x whom he seems here to endeavor to describe and bears no more proportion to his gigantick merit than a mouse does to a mountain parent wit is what also his l  p owes his no thanks for and suspected fame is what he might have omitted as well as phrase profound for i look upon profundity to be an epithet for the judgment not the word which it is here applied to besides he might have considered when he was delineating so great a judge in poetry not to call upon satyr to describe him while he was endeavoring a panegyric upon his undeniable accomplishments what he means by calling his l  p the monarchs favorite is unknown to me and he would do the intive part of the world a kindness if he would explain himself upon that head  their ruski with his early trophies stood won from the swedes upon the baltic flood when conti strove to snatch the polish crown and all the generous poles his conduct own the nation is very much endebted to the lord o  d then admiral russel for his defeat of torvill and there is not one among the party whom he hints at for being ungenerous but pays him their acknowledgment for that days service  rigatshi next our just applause commands the polish peace on his wise conduct stands high chancellor in sobieskis reign and all  poles would have him so again in law upright and prudent in the state in council deep in execution great but by the faction of the swedes oppressed and to make way for fools and knaves dismissed rigatski by whom the lord s  is personated king william having inved him with large demains at rigate in surrey has the character of a very great man though i cannot close with him in his ill manners to the present possessor of the great seal as to wish him to be lord high chancellor again or say that he made way for a fool or a knave since his immediate successor chosen by king william is deservedly famous for being the very reverse of that invious apellation  amongst the polish prelates there appeared cujavia loved for piety for prudence scared careless of faction or of party hate he firmly fixed to sobieskis fate followed his fortune and his favor shared and had the miter for his just reward what though the metropolitan declined and more for contis monarchy designed cujavia all the primates place supplied and poland her intended prince enjoyed culm and posnania ecclesiastic peers and patcherouski old in zeal as years with thirteen sacred polish miters who are polish lords and polish prelates too where all to poland and augustus true in cujavia we may read the b  p of s  character who preached the inuaguration sermon at the coronation of their late majestys king william and queen mary and by culm posnania patcherousky and thirteen mitres more are meant some very good e  l peers who were against the bill to prevent occasional conformity and consequently rue to poland and augustus which consequence i shall no otherwise animadvert upon than that it is injurious to augustus his character as if he was against the bill when he had given such assurances from the throne in favor of the church established  these wore the polish laurels to the last and fixed the polish liberties so fast that fate it self could not the band destroy but what they once possessed they still enjoy these were the columns which so long sustained the load of state when sobieski reigned who all the lines of government restored and held the scepter while he drew the sword when he encampt on the moldavian plains and freed the poles from mahomets servile chains the turkish banuers to his sword submit abroad his valor and at home their wit they fought with equal enemies at home and equal trophies to their conduct come the conquered difficulties of the state make all men own their conduct to be great and they that seek to blame their management and charge on them what they could not prevent should tell us in what age it shall be known no faults attend the state no knaves the crown that bishops are pillars of the church and consequently columns no man will dispute with him but that they held the scepter while he drew the sword i cannot agree with him since it will very much derogate from the honor of the lords justices among whom the temporal l  ds preceding for whom he expresses such regard made a very great figure  ungrateful poland never will be blessed till sobieskis managements confessed till some of his forgotten rules restored such statesmen wield the scepter such the sword till some such heads in polish council sit and some such hero shall for poland fight england has been blessed with more victories since her majestys accession to the throne than what fell to her share for a century before which is a long computation of years compared to thirteen and our counselors heads have done enough at home as well as our heroes hands abroad to eclypse the glory of any hands or heads whatsoever king williams not excepted  finski an upright lithuanian peer sets up for sinking polands prime vizier for application and impertinence no man has half so much with half his sense with formal step and high majestic grin is polander without and swede within envy and awkward spleen sit on his face in speech precise but always thinks apace in earnest nonsense does his hours divide always to little purpose much employed strong in opinion in his judgment weak and thinks himself exceeding politic the music of his tongue is his disease conceives absurdly what he speaks with ease the discord of his facu lties is plain he talks with pleasure what he thinks with pain and there it is owned he shows some policy to make his fluent tongue his brain supply so men are pleased with shadows so from hence the world mistakes his jingling tongue for sense a busy trifling statesman proud and dull a thinking plodding wise substantial fool in all vast polands far extended round no man was known so emptily profound polite in words a stiff and formal tongue and speaks to little purpose very long the noble peer that falls under his censure here is as much above his detraction as the despicable wretch that flings dirt at him is beneath his notice he never employed his momentous hours about other things than the advantage of the prince whose service he was in and as for sinking any one it was never in his thoughts if a person aimed at acted contrary to the wellbeing of the government by polands prime vizier is meant the l  h  t  who owes him no thanks for giving him an infidels title which i never heard belonged to poland before but as the character of the great man whom he vilifies to the lowest degree is false so are the terms he makes use of to bring his designs about by  to him augustus gave the polish seal and made him grieffier to the commonweal they that could not his license first obtain might not go out of poland or come in the public safety was the just pretense to keep the sweeds from true intelligence but the more genuine reason was the pence for in his time the sweeds themselves obtained his blanks to pass their spies to polish land grieffier of poland is likewise a title in no wise belonging to the court he applys it to and the public has been so well satisfied about the pretended proofs of the wretch fullers affidavity of his lordships giving passes to the french discontented natives of england that it looks ridiculous in one that lays any claim to sense to incline toward the very thought of it  the slow unsteady mannager appears too hot for peace too cold for polish wars while charmed with foreign marguerettas song his sleeping orders he delays too long whole fleets attend the minstrels softer notes by her the statesman steers the member votes well might the siren be compared to him that dozd old nature with his touch sublime the lofty cedars danced his softer airs and lofty stupid statesmen bow to hers mr foe sure is acquainted with the hermet in the fable that blows hot and cold with the same breath or else how could he make his slow manager which by the by is not to be hot too hot for peace and too cold for war the wiest of men will have their intervals of diversion and it looks as well in one statesman nay better since the fabric of the universe is governed by harmony to pass away his less important hours with music than for another to spend whole weeks with horse racing at new market besides let him consider who was secretary of state when the ships at vigo were taken and destroy the towns in flanders surrendered and the march to the danube concerted and he must condemn himself for blaming his l  ps dispatch of the public business  of all the polish grave nobility none acts so low that ever was born so high so fond of liberty he never endured the name of slave no not to his own word this paragraph is the product of a complaint that this incendiary vents in all companies about his l  ps not keeping his word with him when in newgate at the same time that he is conscious to himself he performed not the conditions for which the promise was made of his coming to do no damage  augustus saw and soon mislikd the man and found him to the swedish cause incline with easiy skill he read his wellknown fate a useless unregarded tool of state what though the polish diet was possessed and blindly in his favor once addressed the public banter all the kingdom knew it moved their mirth and indignation too the general fixed dislike augustus saw laid by the haughty thing and left him to the law the quacking mountebanking tool of state that neither could be little or be great retired to give us time to let him know no knaves above being told that he is so if the parliament of england addressed the throne in his lordships favor they did nothing but what was consistent with the reputation of that august assembly and which ought to be allowed for the pure effect of his merit as well as taguskiss who had likewise the same honor done him though not for the same service as for no knave is above being told he is so i agree with him but the consequence may tell him before he is much older that an honest man is such as the noblemen whose characters he makes so free with  lawrensky next of prussias royal breed to ladislaus by marriages allied though intrested in sobieskys line yet to the sweedes he always did incline he kept the polish cash in days of yore when kings grew rich and made the people poor and fain would now our polish treasures teach to make their monarchs poor the people rich under lawrensky none that is acquainted with names or things but may know that lawrence e  of r  ter is couched a gentleman too near related to her majesty to be used after such a manner and whose conduct as l  h  t  r has not been excelled by any successor whatever without any reflection upon the present management of the ex  quer  if stories known of old should be revived of leaves torn out and horrid facts connived of crimes too black for satyr to reveal which kings have died on purpose to conceal were but the black record again reviewed when the false peer his masters fate persued his picture would too low for satyr lie and sink the wretch beneath authority whether the french the sax or polish race he ever fawned and looked with janus face when sobieski did the throne obtain he grudgd the crown though his own race should reign but when in viceroys dignity went halves he stoopt to rule moldavian western slaves the tearing the leaves is such a forgery as has been more than once exped and confuted in the late reign when his enemies such as gpd after his lord lieutenantship of ireland published their sham vindication and for that cause requires no other answer than that those who think it meritorious to revile a n  m will not stick to traduce a r  r  now he repines the management supreme is not as he contrived resigned to him for this his viceroys office he laid down again to govern and abuse the crown but wiser councils laid him gently by and left him to bewail his lost authority his character is of a much different complexion for he did not fling up his lieutenancy of ireland for the sake of the prime ministry but for his ease since the irish are an inflexible people and not to be govend easily but by such as are the own native and he was so far from being dissatisfied with the measures taken by those near her majesty that no other motive but the satisfaction in the administration induced him to retire  now he cabals the parties to unite and strives to bring us all to peace in spite courts every side to his absurd design and thinks to make the swedes and cossacks join my soul his sly pretended peace abhor the brooding vnions big with civil war rouse every loyal pole to selfdefence give them for arms their eyes for swords their sense for all men see the empty sham pretense mr review has preached up peace and union to some purpose if at last he turns renegade from his own principles and makes it his business to ridicule such as are for a treaty between the two contending parties give em for arms their eyes says he  swords their sense as if swords were not arms why did he not insert for guns their eyes since arms and swords are the very same sort of weapons  old seymsky was of this intriguing band a polack born on neipers golden strand ancient in crimes bred up to fraud and feud his interest at his masters cost persud a mighty stock of illgot wealth enjoyed when polish troops our polish lands destroyed when his dear countries liberties lay low he fisht in all the troubles made then so when polands kings the polish peers oppressed and property was made the monarchs jest in those dear days he kept the royal cash and forged those cheats he since pretends to lash now he sets up to save the nations pelf and would have no man cheat us but himself detects ill practices with eager vote and rails at bribes with mertenary throat that he should be ungrateful and unjust despise the grace as he betrayed the trust be proud be peevish insolent and base nature has painted that upon his face envy sits rampant on his tottering head and r  es wrote there so plain that every man may read in seymsky the reader must agree with me that he points at sir edward s  r but all to no purpose reverberat ictus the shot rebounds upon himself and the detracter falls a sacrifice to his own calumny at the sitting of the parliament it is en to one but this seymski makes foeski eat his words he has shown many a better man a pleasanter trick and the polish scribe will not be the first whom he has brought upon his knees for breach of privilege for he that writes r  upon a wisemans forehead ought to have fool written on his own besides the rest of the catalogue of hard names which are usually affixed to pillories  and now the conscious criminal appears affects to cant of polands suffering years reproaches little villains with their crimes and rakes among the evils of the times where mismanagements are there they should be taken notice of for little evils as well as great though he is of too intrepid a temper to spare them ought to be animadverted upon  that he should polands liberties maintain who can the wondrous riddle now explain or who believe the fact that knows the man some think indeed it should be understood a penitence for violence and blood to expiate his share in former reigns the sk if not the guilt of which remains if that be true that he should make pretense to censure others for a past offense savours of most prodigious impudence while he that ought to blush at former times boldly condemns contemporary crimes a general charge without mentioning particulars can never affect any gentlemans reputation especially one of his figure and family and h s hints of expiating for violence and blood will never make any impression upon any one that has had the least notice of what public service he had done and continues to do for the good of his native country which he may be styled the ornament as well as defense of  immortal brass sits on his testy brows hardened with bribes with frauds and broken vows infernal feuds flame in his guilty eyes he starts at peace with anger and surprise weaknd in wickedness in wishes strong a bribereceiving hand and clamouring tongue false to himself his monarch and his friends but to the lowest step of pride descends abject and mean when fortunes storms appear proud and intolerable when it is fair noisy in speech in manner insolent and awkwardly submits to government if immortal brass fits on his brows how comes he to be abject and mean when storms appear when a man turns abject his impudence commonly leaves him and dies with his being dispirited or i am wrong informed from experience in the like cases  often the polish monarchs have essayed so much they of his mischiefs were afraid to win the bully off with gentle words and place him in the class of polish lords but he that loved the villainies of life and chewed the air he breathed to sounds of strife that lived upon those particles of fire which nourish feud and prompt the vile desire chose all the glittering offers to despise too vain to be made great too proud to rise if vanity consists in a foolish persuit after titles and applause how can any one be too vain to be made great and if pride is the effect of an ambitious temper that aims at an increase of prerogative and power can it be otherwise than impossible that the gentleman here designed can be too proud to rise i have heard of chewing of tobacco indeed but never heard of chewing the air to sounds of strife which is a note beyond ela  augustus tried him with uncommon grace gave him his household staff and household place his robe of peer attempted to put on but he put by that feather to his son accepts the high command without the name because he covets mischief more than fame the partyzealot never could resign his dear speechmaking old contentious sin resolved the head of faction to supply and as he lived unblest uneasy dye he was too proud to be made great before but here he accepts the high command ay but says our author without the name of a p  as if greatness did not consist more in extensive command than length of title to covet mischief more than fame is none of the most regular expressions that have dropped from mr foe since mischief is fame in one sense and a man may as well be famous that is transmitted to posterity for doing ill things as good  augustus saw the sullen wretch go on neither by art or bounty to be won his malice he despised his pride contenmd and to his juster fate the wretch condemned left him his empty follies to pursue and his unvalued favors with his staff withdrew the white staff was not taken from him but he resigned it and as her majesty taxed him with nothing disrespectful to her august character the poet would have looked like a man of more vcity had he done the same  the unsteady statesmans temper yet untried left him at once in spite of all his pride not all his swelling pride would give relief but sunk his spirit underneath his grief the cowardly selfcondemned abandoned wretch saw his ambitious ends beyond his reach with strong reluctance all his honors quits and with his places now resigns his wits so pride unbounded with no power sufficed wants courage but to see it self despised how could he quit his honors with reluctance when the very gazette tells us he voluntary resigned them or how could his temper be said to be yet untried on account of his places when he had the experiment made upon him more than once in the surrender of more profitable employs but contradiction sis what the party gain their ends by and so he is at liberty to use them  when men are raised by fate above their sense nature must sink them in her own defense humane society would else decay and mad men quite demolish liberty for when the bloated monsters once pulled down the soul deserts the bubbles broke and gone abjectly wretched and with shame surprised he meanly begs what he before despised the high extreme inverts in his distress dejected to a despicable vile excess so bullies are but cowards in disguise whom few men value all men should despise if he was not raised by fate above his sense in being speaker of the house of commons treasurer of the navy etc places of greater importance by far than the comps of the household twas a little out of the way to make him lose it for what was little better than a feather to a gentleman of his years and frequent indispositions and to make nature do it in her own defense requires such explanatory notes from him as he is not at leisure to give us being so taken up in reading horace cum notis variorum  rokosky next fills up the spacious rolls the mighty captain bassa of the poles in foreign expeditions he is employed and many polish millions has destroyed abortive projects flow in his loose brain he loves to make a tedious voyage in vain he will make the polanders infidels do what we can notwithstanding he has been told over and over that poland is a christian country but its sir george r  k whom he fallens his talons on now and he that has done more good than all our admirals at sea for more than twenty years last past must be a captain bassa and marked out under an odious distinction  abandoned poland how art thou betrayed sold for that very money thou have paid the greedy monsters that receive thy pay trifle thy blood and time and strengh away rokosky covetous and insolent on polands weightiest errands has been sent small prophecy might those events foretell where he commanded that could fight so well was the destroying the ships at la hogue the breaking the boom at londonderry the deliverance of two hundred ships trading to turkey the levant etc the glorious succels at vigo the taking of gibraltar which the spaniards have spent so much blood and treasure about in endeavoring to regain it the naval victory over the whole power of france and spain of so little force as to render him liable with being taxed with trifling our blood time and strength away if so what apellation will our future miscarriages fall under when it shall be visible how we suffer for wantof his conduct in the marine affairs  his voyages never have been made in vain he took such care of coming home again no man could ever give him a defeat and none can match him at a safe retreat the carefullst officer the poles could choose for when they bid him fly he will never refuse a negtive soldier always in the right was never beaten and would seldom fight poland will never her ancient glory show while knaves and cowards fight her battles so to preserve a fleet sometimes is equal to a victory and prince  got more honor in the last war by making a gloriou retreat than luxemburgh did by defeating the confederate  at landen if he is a negative soldier that has fought the  of france and his two seconds with one single ship with at being worsted what a champion of a man must he be  an affirmative  osky now supports the polish crown and fights the quarrels of his masters throne  by proxy when he fights his own mr  is not at all obliged to you for reviving the story of  dispute between him and sir george which tends so  to his disreputation and reminds people of the merry  the rehearsal mentions of that friend and acquaintance  fighting duels should any man

champion for a party and if telling a man to  the open field of election as sir g  did  he wrote what he taxed him with and would make it good ie bullying i dare persuade my self an assertor of such a contradiction will not be able to define what fighting is  part ii in polish diet now they all appear in polish diet all men free from fear may all their most malicious thoughts declare augustus calls them to the place supreme there first they swear to poland then to him that they will both support and both defend and all profess what very few intend there from the throne he tells them of the state what things occur and prompts their calm debate tells them his steady thoughts due peace to give and ancient polish honor to retrieve how he by law came there by law would reign and all their polish liberties maintain but lets them know he finds to his surprise some poles are even for this his enemies freedom of speech is allowed in the english parliaments but uner certain restrictions for some members have spoke so much here as to be called to the bar and afterward sent to the tower for talking too freely as for swearing first to poland then to him would mr foe give himself the trouble of perusing the oaths he members of parliament take he would not have occasion to be old he is in an error on that account since they swear to be true to their queen and country not country and queen  informs them of a deep livonian plot and prompts them all to search it farther out tells them the real danger of the state and asks them to prevent their monarchs fate but presses them to peace and calm debate by the livonian plot is meant the scotch plot which was so very deep indeed that i never heard of any one yet that found the ottom of it  it is all in vain for faction had possessed some members all the diet to molest in vain the sullen deputies debate in vain they weakly prop the sinking state in vain to oaths and loyalty pretend they sell that prince whom faintly they defend the commons were as hearty in pursuit of such as were thought criminal  that juncture as their lordships though they did not appoint a committee to meet at n  d house and were so very far from faintly defending her majesty that never a heartier and more earnest address came from a people to a prince on that account what remains is to ask the sense of the last line and how it is a consequence that they must sell that prince whom they defend faintly  satyr with gentle strokes the mischiefs touch how little some men said how some too much how some in hopes to pull the cossacks down slight the livonian plot expose the crown cavil contrive make speeches and debate and jest too much with polands dangerous state prepostrous laws absurd in their design and made on purpose to be broke bring in divide in order to consolidate and tack destructon to the wounded state secure the polish freemen in a goal for fear the nations liberties should fail the polish dearbought privilege destroy that dyets tyranny they might enjoy support the polish dignity and crown by pulling all her just defenses down and save the tottering kingdom from her fate by decently embroiling church and state he should have given us the names of those laws which he cal preposterous and absurd as his reader might have known his meaning i have heard indeed of bringing in a bill but never of a la that was brought for nothing can be called a law till it has ha the royal assent as for securing the polish freemen in a goa those freemen as he terms them were guilty of an express breac of privilege in which the honor of parliament was so far concerned that they had lessened their authority but for their commitment  mackreski first the dyets pamphleteer stood up  all poland waited on his chair for all men looked some wondrous thing to hear so once the teeming hill in travail groaned the expecting world the mighty wonder owned young mountains twins at least they looked should come when one poor mouse closed the vast laboring wom by mackreski we are to understand sir humphry who has written so very much and well for the honor of the house of commons and so learnedly vindicated their privileges that were this author master of any gratitude he would rather pay his acknowledgments to so worthy a representative than make such unmannerly comments on what he himself and all the commons of england are so nearly concerned in  the empty orator in florid speech told them that he was just as wise as rich tos printed books for his design referred though that he ever designed no mortal ever heard he talked indeed sometimes of church and state of piety and of the lord knows what but no man yet his vast intentions found deep as his mines and like his brains unsound twas full a polish hour the member spoke but all the diet all he said mistook some said he talked of this and some of that just so he jumbld providence and fate in both the same intention he pursued neither to understand or to be understood thus he harangud them thirteen times and more and still he left them where they were before he talked of crowns of property and law and means to make them keep themselves in awe of persecuting peace and quiet jars nations in nubibus beyond the stars of moderate feuds and calm distempered states and moved to bleed us to avoid debates proposed by poverty our wants to cure starving our tradesmen to employ the poor and backed his mighty project with a speech would spoil the nations trade to make them rich in weighty conference propt a tottering cause to set our privilege above our laws but as some learned speeches used to fail because they would too much head and had no tail so this was hist about because they said twas all made up of tail and had no head mackreski thus his learned breath bestowed and as it did no harm it did no good and yet his speech had this unlooktfor charm that as it did no good it did no harm if the poet that lampoons him were but half so wise and rich he would have no reason to expose himself in his saturdays review july   by complaining of sleeping debates in trade of seventeen years standing being recivd and the very management and produce of those mines he is so angry at the depth of is such an argument of his designing that he shows his own want of brains by saying no man ever heard that he designed if the diet mistook what he said why did they close with his projection and pass his bill for the relief of the poor but the poet mistakes him and therefore all must as for the rest of the jargon of scandal upon this gentleman it is all of a piece and his quibling about his speeches being made up of all tail and no head and his convertible terms which he is so famous for in his little master review no good and no harm they are beneath sir humphrys notice and our observation  pacski a polish deputy stood next and all the polish senators perplexed his zeal was for the church so fiery red his breath at distance struck the cossacks dead plosko the polish bishop he oerthrew and made augustus forced resentment show the reverend almoner at once displace and aged virtue bowed to rampant vice hark how the partyhero silence broke and mad with zeal and mad with envy spoke by pacski we may read sir j  n p  n a gentleman whose hereditary zeal for the established church and government is what renders him obnoxious to the censures of those that would share in the revenues of the church while they are enemies to its worship if he did make complaints to parliament against his diocesan every gentleman has the liberty so to do when aggrieved and it has been more than once resolved in st stephens chapel that no peer has any thing to do with elections for members to serve in parliament   ye poles says he regard the tottering state  and think with me of our forefathers fate  the rebel cossacks all their force oerthrew i would rather see the swedes do so for you  but let us all the cossacks first expel  and tack their ruin to the tributebill  the poles may then in peace and union thrive  and ecclesiastic tyranny revive augustus may our quiet recommend  but while these live what peace can he pretend  and if augustus favors their defense  to his dethorning it is a just pretense  i hate a cossack though he were my prince the rebel cossacks viz the roundheads in olivers time and what they did ought to be fresh in our memory that we may prevent the like barbarities from them again but how tacking the occasional bill as a clause to the land tax could be tacking their ruin to the tribute bill is beyond my power to divine since there was no property invaded but the church only secured by an act of parliament in her behalf  he spoke and fury choked his rising spleen and passion kept more dangerous language in for now he mourns his just designs are crossed complains that speech that place he talked for lost declares he meant no mischief to the crown aimed at no general interest but his own for that he spoke and thought he should no doubt talk himself in and talk the cossacks out but all his province their resentment show all his consolidating nonsense know their future trusts to packski they refuse so perish all that polands trusts abuse sir john is of another temper than to talk for a place and of too large an estate to make his conscience truckle to his interest as some that have gone over from the churchparty have neither is it fact that all his province disclaim his proceedings they show their just resentment indeed for his affection to his queen and country for they have resented it so as to choose him again for one of the knights of the shire which is an argument that mr foe shot his bolt too soon when he said their future trusts to pacski they refuse  when froward toweroski took his place zeal on his tongue and fury in his face  ye reverend poles says he let heaven forbid  that words should poland s liberties decide  our wars remote but these are foes indeed  i would rather beat the cossacks than the swede augustus talks to us i hope in vain  of peace while factious cossacks shall remain  the spawn of rebels of tartarian race  who ask no favor and deserve no grace  if first augustus will destroy the breed  then peace at home may probably succeed  but while this viprous brood the poles betray  i would not augustus though himself were here obey the noble gentleman that is personated here mr b  brother to the e  of a  is of another disposition than what is froward and his sweetness of temper is as remarkable as his loyalty to the present government which he would not forfeit his obedience to for any cause whatsoever though he has but too much reason to think our peace will never succeed at home till such as are averse to it and say peace peace when there is no peace i mean the dissenters are removed from having any share in the administration  he said and more than half the diet bowed and with consenting silence twas allowed a law should pass the cossacks to suppress the only way to polands happiness mean while the assembly seprately repaired to church and there the famous burski heard now stanski then maroski and a third that always dealt in tropes and similies absurd these furious priests the fatal stroke excite tell them of kings that spared the amalekite the grave divines in pulpit rhetrick known talked of the dyets wit to show their own banterd a text or two and talked some greek and so went home to drink out all the week dooms the poor cossacks from the sacred text and raved in zeal till he the cause perplexed it was but reasonable that a law should be brought in to prevent the growth of hypocrisy and endeavors be used to save reprobates against their wills if they would not be instrumental to their own salvation themselves and if all the clergy in england had been so deservedly famous as dr birch some people would have been nearer to that happy state than they now are  priests like the female sex when they engage there is always something bloody in their rage he told the diet they must fight and pray and pull the cossacks down the shortest way and in his zeal so far his text forgot he perjured his augustus on the spot unchurchd the nation cursed the polish tribes and for their cure the cossacks blood prescribes if dr stanhope in his sermon upon the  0th of january at st margarets church applied the sparing the amalekite to the subject of that day it was applicable enough for the remissness of king charles the second in not taking off all the regicides has been the chief cause of our homebred civil dissentions ever since and if he talked greek it is more than the learned mr foe can do the want of which tongue makes him exasperated against all that use it  satyr thy just regret with force restrain with temper wite although thou think with pain when once the pulpitplague infects the land and sermonreaders get the upperhand the nations ruined all the towns undone and tonguepad evils through the vitals run reason submits its captivated head and raging nonsense governs in its stead in vain our banished liberties we seek wisemen are bound to hear when coxcombs speak reason pays homage to impertinence and noise obtains the victory from sense the clamouring priest dogmatick proud and dull assumes dictating right and calls his master fool how he could unchurch the nation by preaching in defense of the national church i cannot imagine neither is it in my power to know he could perjure augustus for persons guilty of a breach of an oath in my humble opinion must perjure themselves as for his reflection upon the priesthood in general he acts contrary to their precepts and consequently is not to be expected to speak well of them and if he himself thinks with pain then some body does so as well as my lord of n  m a great condescension truly for our author to accept of the character he has bestowed upon that worthy p  r well but he has reason to think with pain the church of england clergy are sermonreaders they dont preach and pray extempore like dissenters because they think before they speak which premeditation of theirs makes reason submit and raging nonsense govern in its stead most exquisite logic  but if the pulpit now began to fire the press the pulpits echo push it higher bold sachareski in a polish rage would all the poles in civil blood engage prints his exasperated fiery zeal and damns the crown for fear of the common weal by sachareski it will not be amiss to read mr sacheverel fellow of magdalen college a gentleman whose accomplishments and zeal render him as well an honor to the church and university as an otnament to the college he belongs to and as loyal to the queen as he is faithful to his country  and two extremes one mischief may prevent this fury made the polish lords relent and senators their first resolves repent how can moderation be censured for an extreme for that is a virtue that is inseparable from the church of england and if some l  s and gentlemen were not so hearty as was expected for the churchs service it must be attributed to the weakness of their own resolves not any thing that was defective in her worship  the diet reassumed cavenski broke the healing partys silence first and spoke the hsty priest says he i understood the gown too often dips the sleeves in blood the unheard of insolence amazed my soul and horror seizes every christian pole i am a northern deputy it is known where numerous cossacks dwell in every town the peaceful and industrious people show no reason why they should be treated so what is it to us what their forefathers were the polish crowns too fast for us to fear besides rebellions differ but in name in future ages ours may be the same if ever the old fagellan race should reign and damn our revolutions it is in vain to talk of titles where the swords devour they are always rebels who have lost their power with all deference to my l  d m  ss of h  ns excellent qualities and healing discourse though his l  p is to be commended for standing up for so numerous a people as yorkshire who is so happy in the choice of so excellent a champion mr foe has made him make but an indifferent speech which is somewhat unmannerly for a gentleman of his great quality for i cannot make sense of the hasty priest says he i understood the gown too often dips the sleeves in blood besides he introduces his l  p speaking as if the revolution was a rebellion and insinuates by way of comparison as if it was equally criminal with that in forty one  the cossacks now incorporate and tied by laws by interest and by blood allied are native poles in polands interest bound to tack them now would polands peace confound they are rich and brave and always have withstood th invading tartars with their wealth and blood and have undoubted title to pretend to enjoy that land they helped us to defend besides by laws their liberties remain those laws augustus promised to maintain this priest would make those promises in vain i think their liberties their due to enjoy that they may help us now the swedes destroy with him the old nobility concurred and damned the bill at cruel and absurd who doubts the dissenters right and title to their estate heavens forbid they should be wronged in the minutest particle either as to their temporal or spiritual concerns the churchparty neither has or ever had any thoughts that tended toward their no enjoying the land since the late revolution neither did the queen promise to establish them only maintain them in the benefits that accrue to them from the act of toleration  the zealous deputies resist in vain and envy prompts them to their strong disdain with mighty struggle and avowed regret they only seem to adjourn the warm debate resolved in future dyets to pursue the cossacks ruin and the nations too if the church of england can never be sufficiently secured till the bill passes twould be impardonable for them wholly to drop the debate wherefore it is but their duty to adjourn it to a more convenient opportunity  augustus how unhappy is thy fate how hardly do thou hold the tottering state in vain of peace thou do the poles persuade deep as infernal darkness their designs are laid never was queen happier than her present majesty and never was princess more the delight of the church of england who pays her the hearts of her sons by way of acknowledgments of her duty while the offerings of the dissenters have more of appearance than real sincerity  let them no more thy sovereign peace abuse subjects can never the princes grace refuse but it is a certain signal to the throne they aim at no less purchase than his crown but still augustus his just wrath forbears and honors load the wretches whom he fears fain he would all their due allegiance buy does all his soft engaging favors try to all the charms of kindness he is inclined with grace would win a turks more constant mind how can the patriots that stand up in defense of the church aim at her majestys crown have not they more to lose than the dissenters are not they possessed of the best estates of the land and would not a french power be more destructive of their civil rights and immunities than those of a sect of men who have no right to any establishment and who have more than once witness their brethren in scotland closed in with rome and france in opposition to a worship they are declared enemies of  disposed to pardon all their follies past and win them to their countrys good at last heaps undeserved his favors on their heads with gentle hand to their own duty leads shows them the way to save the bleeding state and trust them with his own and polands fate what is hinted here exactly tallies with her majestys usage of the dissenters since her happy accession to the throne but it has always been the practice of the party to throw dirt first and to fence off a reproach by fixing it upon those from whence they expect it  till treason blackened with ingratitude had all their sense and modesty subdued ripened by royal mercy for reproof the patient prince had been provoked enough whom the aspersions in this paragraph belong to may be soon discovered by the whigs insolent usage of her majesty and ministry till the last session of parliament when a change was made in the administration and as for treason blackened with ingratitude they know best how to form new conspiracies that have been so dextious in managing old  in vain he is of livonian plots afraid and swedes preparing poland to invade intestine feud the polish rakes pursue their king instead of cossacks to undo neglect the public danger to the last and make the nations real fears their jest willing to leave us open to surprise poland can have no greater enemies as for the plot here hinted at we may expect discoveries of the authors of it from the parliament of scotland as soon as they shall fit till then perhaps it may be out of his power to know when to fix it for it is an unquestionable truth that he that hides a thing is the best able to find it again  tococksi first a forward southern pole a pollishd carcass and a burnished soul we cannot say he did the silence break for he did always little else but speak how vain a things the empty sound of words abstracted from the meaning it affords long speeches from his beated spleen proceed and nature makes him talk to ease his head the hypocondriack vapors upward fly and form some words of state and policy bear with the statesman twas his flux of gall for all men know he never meant at all by tococksi we are to understand mr t  ke a gentleman desevedly the envy of all ill men because he is the glory of the go and who may truly be said to be polished and of shining abiliti if any gentleman in england deserves that character so that wh is inserted of him is the very reverse of his demeanor and  is so far from not thinking at all that the politeness and effica of what he speaks intimates as much as if he thought always  he dooms the cossacks to tartarian shades their civil and religious rights invades demand no reason satyr that is supplied with passion parties prejudice and pride but if his wiser arguments you would know he heard twas just old seymski told him so that learned oracle supports the cause and noisy zeal supplies the want of laws can a dissenter be said to be doomed to tartarian shades when it is endeavored that he may be rescued from finking downwards through the great weight of hypocrisy and is it not the highest injustice to say mr t  ke inclines this way or that way as sir ed s  r directs him when sir ed  himself would think it no disparagement to advise with him  the hot young beau affects the marshals chair and hopes in time to rule the diet there now he is the partyleader of the day resolved to teach the cossacks how to pray or from the polish church to drive em all away to teach any one to pray after the true form of worship is to deserve the thanks of those that are instructed and though he does not affect the chair i question whether there is one among his enemieshas an equal title to it  a troop of tackers at his elbow stand ready to move at his usurped command who all the image of their captain bear and in their name may read their character the word in polish signifies a fool a man without a meaning called a tool a weighty blockhead with an empty scull when the tackers in k charles the seconds time were for tacking away all the prerogatives of the crown the name of them was not fool then but knave twas their own dear invention and always put in practice by the commonwealth party but for the church to assume only the liberty of trying the experiment once and that for the preservation of the monarchy there it must immediately fall under the name of folly because successless  nor let enquiring heads decline the name tackers and tookites always are the same the emblematick titles easily known their coat of arms stands up in warsaw town rampant the ass enrobd in lions skin to make the bully keep the blockhead in quartered at large it lies perteperpale the asses ears against the lyons tail he might have spared himself making the tackers a coat of arms for it is well known they had them from their predecessors and have not been so good customers to the heraulds office as the whigs of late years who have had none to put upon their coaches till they paid for them  the family from tartary descends and all the furiosos are their friends before the swedish conquest they came in and some are lately run away again their numerous offspring fills our polish rolls so close allied to all our native poles we hardly know from whence they came or when and yet they boast they are trueborn polishmen these are the men would pull the cossacks down and after them augustus and his crown but polands genius laughed in hissing air and guilt made all the rakes disclose their fear the bills thrown out but still they push their cause in future dyets hope for future laws rail at the cossacks false constructions draw and bully those they cannot kill by law if they hardly know from whence they came or when how comes he to lay it down for granted that they are descended from tartary but i forget he is quoting himself and the trueborn englishman must be brought in though introduced by the head and shoulders  bromski with polish air but swedish skill boasts that he was the father of the bill in foreign parts he traveled much in vain just made a book and so came home again tells us he saw a bridge at rochester and when he was at chatham he was there so when progressively to france he is come he gravely says he knew he want at home tells us he saw at oyse a sad distaster the bridge broke down becauset could stand no faster and at chantilly the prince of condes town a castle stood before they pulled it down montrevils fortified but is not strong paris lies round and yet is two miles long and of the buildings this wise truth he tells they are genrally of stone or something else some lands lie high some lower still and lower and where the people are not rich they are poor the learned author then proceeds to tell how near the alps he clamberd up a hill with many a weary step and many a stride and so came down again on the other side tells us at rome he saw a swinging church and reads a learned lecture on the porch informed the world in print where he had been but bought the books himself for fear they should be seen his traducing mr br  ly for his book is no argument of the goodness of his own besides his contemptible treatment of it will render that gentleman more valuable because his enemy is so illiterate as not to be able to distinguish between what is a learned lecture or not and it is enough for him not to have blackened him as to other concerns for had he been guilty of any thing like a crime he would have been sure of being told of it  this worthy author warm with polish zeal strives all the cossacks freedom to repeal corrects the bill and to remove our doubt the persecution preamble left out a mark of honesty to let us know they scorned to hide what they resolved to do sure of the game the mark was so laid by and blinder cossacks saw their destiny the preamble was not left out because it favored of persecution but because the dissenters and their friends in parliament exclaimed against it as such  thus fired with party zeal he read the bill and asked the diet how they liked his style with many a learned speech and formal face for italy had taught him the grimace the exasperated fop his plot declares and to the diet makes revengeful prayers at cossacks ruin makes the grand essay and tacks the churchs fall the shortest way formality of face is all the sobriety the generality of the adverse party are famous for and if the person that calumniates him had but any thing like his learning and breeding he would have made it his choice to have paid him his acknowledgments for his services to his country not a return of base ingratitude forsuch inestimable goodness  meerski an ancient mercenary pole with vicious body and a hardened soul grown old in crimes as he was lame in sense but not at all decayed in impudence his long since baffled conscience told his fate he owns he is damned and there is an end of that but for the cossacks bill he raved so loud and so inflamed his old fermented blood that some advised him to go home to bed open a vein or two and shave his head not knowing he had long ago been mad by his description he should know sir thomas m  rs no better than mr br  ly but madness is like the yellow jaundice and those that are possessed with it think every one they see of the same complexion otherwise he would never say this worthy knight was under that predicament  the old buffoon debauched in early time boasts of his vice and hugs himself in crime lewdness has forty years forsook the beast and left his vicious body to its age and rest but though the active part of vice is dead the rampant devils regnant in his head hurries the lewd distempered wretch along with vile blasphemous voice and baudy tongue if leudness has forsook his breast forty years then how can the rampant devil hurry the lewd distempered wretch along still for it is impossible for a man not to be wicked and wicked at the same time  well might an ancient polish bard decree jowler the hound a wiser beast than he meersky has always been the dyets jest laughs loudest at himself to please the rest betwixt the extremes of banter and of rage he made himself the fool the house the stage the polish merry andrew shifting shapes till he is the very block head which he apes i would not be thought to compare mr dryden who is the ancient polish bard here meant to mr foe on account of his poetical performance but for ill nature the latter has such an excess of it that he may be properly said to lose by the character though mr dryden had his share too and fell foul upon sir thomas on account of a personal pique which always carries more malice than truth in it  wardsky a deputy of northern race weak in his head but very strong in face assurance many blessings may contain and often times supplys the want of brain a junior tookite forward in the cause to damn the cossacks by unheard of laws a scolding clamouring member vain and loud noisy in words and not a little proud his polish fury ran before his sense mighty in wit vast in impertinence the hissing diet laughed the beau won on muttered a curse or two and so sat down how can mr w  rd be mighty in wit and vast in impertinence at the same time unless mr foe takes wit and impertinence for convertible terms as he did the elements of air and water in one of his reviews  satyr make room for men of polish wit whose zeal as well as learnings too polite a polish tookite of collegiate fame hight anneslesky that is his polish name satyr may make room for mr annesly member of parliament for the university of cambridge a long as it pleases for it though i do not wonder a person should have no good opinion for colleges that has never been in any other than that of newgate  he learnt ill tongues in cambrias famous hall and very apely represents them all down with the cossacks is his darling word the bully tongue supplies the tamer sword he damns the cossacks with exalted vote and horrid language fills his raveing throat nor does it check the mans degenerate scorn to think that he himselfs a cossack born rather than not surpress the growing evil he freely votes his fathers to the devil the earl of anglesea lord privy seal to king charles ii whom this paragraph highly injures in calling him a cossack was advanced for his loyalty and zeal for the church established and being the father of this worthy gentleman made such provision for his sons education as is in no wise consonant to the dissenters communion for though they have their separate universities at vtrecht leyden etc they are averse to the two universities here where religion and loyalty are taught and practiced which is an argument that he did not design to have his son bred up otherwise than in those principles which he so gloriously adheres to and how a man can vote his fathers to the devil by coming up to his fathers direction i must profess my self incapable of explaining  never did university pretend to polish diet such a wretch to send it is owned they did not choose him for his sense but he got in by dint of impudence a finished coxcomb with assuming wit in all but sense and manners he is complete so furnished with the language of the town he made our dunghill rhetoric all his own all his endeavors to support the state h expresses in the style of billingsgate of modesty and manners very shy and blessed with every gift but honesty if he has neither sense nor manners how comes he to be blessed with every gift but honestys for as i take it sense and manners are gifts and he cannot have them and not have them at the same time  gransky was newly made a polish lord though most men thought twas hasty and absurd his honor thus before his wealth should rise but that his other stock that want supplies by gransky the poet designs we shall read the l  g  ll though he gives us no lineaments of him in his pretended character that he was made a lord was the queens act and deed and to call his creation absurd is to make her majesty guilty of that absurdity  one farther mischief his advancement brought our polish mob have made the grievance out mayfair and hockly suffer such a blow twill all the bears and backsword men undo all things give way to fates eternal doom the shouting crowd have lost their captain tom see how the stage of dirty honor fails and warsaw her street colonel bewails no more the gladiator now appears patron to all the whores and all the bears the polish smithfield butchers storm and rage and sable weeds adorn the drooping stage prize fighting triumphs pass no more cheap side nor female champions in their armor ride the sword and daggerheroes are undone gransky their darling patron granskys gone augustus thus at one unhappy word lost the wild gentry first to gain the lord when once a gentleman comes to be the envy of a party and an overmatch for them in politics as well as popularity and the peoples affection they make it their endeavor to render him little least his merits should raise him too high for their reach this worthy patriots services by sea and land attest for him that his thoughts are above prize fighting and such vulgar exercises and though he may have diverted himself as well as others by seeing the rarities of art and nature it is no more than the greatest councellor in the cabinet descends to sometimes  yet gransky once the peoples humor crossed he would be for the bill whater it cost though all the poles their high dislike expressed and so the bill and lord made up the jest gransky was always zealous for the state but when the swedes endangered polands fate he gravely vowed and swore he would never associate more noblemen and gentlemen than he who refused the association at first have taken it since and to be singly in the right is more honorable than to have thousands embark with him in a cause that is wrong  not vows nor oaths can polish members bind when latent prospects preposess the mind for when he had the mareschals chair in view through forty oaths that blessing he would pursue satyr the ambitious wretch commiserate insult no more a man of adverse fate the sullen members chagrin and perplexed with high extremes of pride and envy vexed because from speaking office he must fall for two long years he would hardly speak at all none that knows him will say that he is not master of abilities to fill the speakers chair and had the person that censures him for hardly speaking at all these two long years managed his pen as the noble p  r is said to manage his tongue he would have no occasion next session of parliament to take the country air when the winter draws other people to the city  augustus always all mens good intends to make the man of mischief some amends he sent him down among his western friends the tinners petty diet he prepares beargarden there in miniature appears the mobbassembly healed his discontent for rabble always was his element a sign that he knows the constitution of the stannaries to say it is a beargarden and mobassembly when most of the best gentlemen of the west gave their appearance there i hope he has changed his mind since his lordships removal from being lord warden or it will be an affront to mr godolphin who succeeds him  in high mock majetty and awkward state he apes the prince and thinks himself as great the black assembly in the sulfurous shades where mining hand the glittering oar invades  with all the elder evils of the mines  he calls in convocations like divines  mobbd them a speech within their smoaky den said much of nothing and came home again the speech which he calls a mobbspeech may be seen in the gazette and to say much of nothing is rather an argument of his dexterity in discourse than against it as for his calling the elder devils of the mines like divines to the convocationhouse that carries such an odious reflection upon the church of england clergy in general that i tought to be censured by the civilmagistrate  bankski a new contemporary lord an orator at polands chancery board

he will allow him to have no sense an instance of the satyrists great knowledge in cicero whose oratory consisted not only in the cadence of his words but the sense of them as for his voice being a pun upon his name viz that there is music in it and his name is finch that is so sorry a conundrum that owen swan would kick his vinegar drawer out of doors for it  augustus moved him as twas understood that he might do no harm who did no good the cossacks at his honor much rejoice for right or wrong they always loss his voice and finkys glad of his assistance here to check sometimes the too much talking peer by force to stop the forward weak effort lest he should make the diet too much sport how often in pity has he pinned him down whispered his fathers credit and his own told him his grandsires old substantial rule that silence never can describe a fool the queen moved him from the commons to the peers from a true sense of his worth and the nation is more indebted to his assistance than his brother who needs it not and is second to no one patriot whatsoever in every acquisition whether natural or artificial that can make a complete statesman  unhappy inski had he been but wise and took his younger brothers grave advice whartski mobunski and a hundred more had been as sober as they were before the dyets gravity had never been broke for no man laughed but just when inski spoke for a man to be laughed at and disrespectfully treated by some people redounds to his credit since we are equaly to consider the persons that laugh with those that are laughed at and the character of the one is to be esteemed or despised according to the character of the other  bucksky a stalking sharping polish peer a whoreing gameing swearing chicaneer how just is fate in his

animadvert upon his poetical forehead that could have the impudence to say so much when there is so little reason of saying any thing of this nature and point out a person so plain in affronting of whom not only the whole nobility is concerned but the queen her self who is the fountain of all honor and is interested in keeping its crystal streams pure and undefiled from such horrid

the ancient tyrants vilest part to fawn with spleen and to insult with art in polands western capital he reigns binters himself at most excessive pains seeks the recorders chair and fain he would dispense those laws he never understood a hackney deputy for every town but soonest chosen where he least was known full thirty years he did the house molest the dyets banter and the kingdoms jest in

secures the cash and leaves the rest to fate enricht with fraud in trick and cheat grown old and places bought on purpose to be sold yet to complete himself the nations jest he damned the very bribes that he possessed by his own vote disgorges ill got fees and so by law corrects his own diseate thus he became the dyets daily sport a knave in council and a boor at court learned without letters vain without conceit empty of manners overgrown in wit of high tyrannick notions prepossest the fitter to be monarch of the west when seymskis froward spirits gone to rest great wits will be guilty of mistakes sometimes i perceive for the person misrepresented here is one of his own kidney and he may sooner find sir r  g  n at hannover than affecting the recorders chair at exeter and if he is guilty of any thing here taxed with he belongs to the poets own party and muchgood may he do them for sir e  s  r has a greater value for the monarchy than to have a republican for his disciple unless it be to convert him  powski a noisy polish advocate grown rich by law and buisy in the state gravely he speaks in polish bombast style and thinks the dyets pleased because they smile tav finksi could have laid him down the rule a wise mans smiles a banter to a fooi but powski furnished with opinion wit none but uncommon follies can commit in thought profound and in contrivance vast speaks best to every question when it is past every one that has heard of sir thomas pois has been acquainted with other qualities than what he is here censured for an that he is so far from speaking in bombast style that the happiness of his periods terminates in the most intelligible expressions that can be made use of as to his speaking always to a question when it is passed the author would do well to explain himself for i never heard of any that spoke to a question before it was passed  some rakish poles with these at once concurred who peace and cossacks both alike abhorred buisy in vice but careless of the state thoughtless of partypeace or polands fate of these mad crakeroski was the first of all the polish deputies the worst mean to a proverb and below lampoon was born too late and may be h  too soon the former dyets thrust him out of doors and let him loose to laws and polish whores though twas confessed the bribe was not the crime but twas the r  e that told on it ruined him this gent is the better to be spoken of because set down for a madman in his ridiculous meter and if he is below lampoon why does the poet take such pains to expose him but perhaps mr author does not think himself below lampoon and therefore does it on purpose to lampoon himself  cookski a city knight got out of jayl stockjobbd the state to make the bill prevail the dantzick merchants mercenary tool a

was punishment and was protection too vilely he spent what basely he had won by bribes enricht and by that wealth undone as for sir thomas c  k every one knows what he was sent to the tower for and the character of mercenary so very ill becomes him that no one has been more famed for generosity witness his sheriffalty which fell very little short of sir arles duncombs how the tower could be his punishment d protection at the same time is very difficult to be explain though had he censured sir thomas for being so mean spid as to refuse the mayoralty of london because sir john rsons had lopd

pursuance of former acts of parliament in particular at of uniformity to strengthen what had been passed by ing lords and commons and render her present majestys eign as glorious for the preservation of the church from er secret and declared enemies as she has been for that of urope  but still augustus in the center stands and guides the dangerous reins with steady hands upported by his peoples cheerful aid no more at false livonians he is dismayed or of the feirce invading swedes afraid the diet rises and the king intends to purge his household and reform his friends dismisses from his presence and his pay the guilty poles who hardly durst their sentence stay but fled before the high command came down and left him still posessd of his long envy crowned the very cheerful aid here spoken of was advanced and forwarded by the very patriots whom he treats after such a rascally manner and the time may come when her majesty may be more sensible than he would have her of the removal of such gentlemen from her presence and favor who have made it their whole business to deserve her gracious approbation for it is impossible that a queen descended from the family of the stuarts can discountenance men of probity affection and loyalty to her person and government  so seymski first dismissed thawakned court to western poles conveys the swift report tells them in what disgust he came away because he had been too great a r  ke to stay that all his late proclaimed disgrace had been because he wanted manners to his qu  n the case was hard since it was always known he scorned his

promoted him to that dignity for nothing can be plainer than that if i give a man a place because of his opposition to goodness i must be an ill person my self a scandalous inuendo which the writer ought to be called to an account for but to answer this paragraph in his own way take this noble gentlemans character from a very worthy gentleman and yet a tacker in his poem called moderation displayed where the fiend speaking of the late change at cort says after my lord of i  sy removal had been spoken of senato too who bravely does deride sempronia s little arts and female pride whose lofty look and whose maiestick mien confess the touring godlike soul within a speaker of unparalleled renown long in the senate long in conncil known allied to e of rochester celsus by the noblest claim by the same principles of worth the same old as he is still firm his heart remains and dauntless his decning frame sustains so poised on its own base the center bears the nodding fabric of the universe   finski prevented the approaching fates and wisely his own fall anticipates the courtier with the statesman he resigned guilt taught him so much of his princes mind the earl of n  m then is acknowledged to do one wise thing at last sure the poet forgets himself or he would never have been guilty of such a condescension but his guilt taught him his princes mind he foresaw her majestys intentions and upon that account was before hand with the queen and resigned the seals before they were taken from him very well but how came mr foe to know the queens mind for i never heard he belonged to the cabinet before but railery apart hear what the devil himself says likewise of this noble peer in the asoresaid moderation displayed  villiaski followed conscious of his crimes loath to account for sohieskis times augustus sobieskis rule pursues this cannot employ the wretch could that abuse equal their right he that could that betray it cannot be fairly thought should this obey what the e  of i  sy did in relation to k  w  after his death was honorable and the duty of his post and he was so very far from abusing or betraying his master that he had been false to his mistress had he not secured that princes closet take his character likewise from the same valuable poem then from this near attendance be removed  though by all admired and lvd though his sweet temper and obliging

whose collatral lines virtue withequal force and luster shines   too happy poland if thy sons but knew how their own just deliverance to pursue let the degenerate palatines combine their prince and liberties to undermine call in the swedes consult confederate with the infatiate enemies of the state it is all in vain heaven points the sacred way to them that dare augustus still obey let them but in his juster cause unite it is justice and the law make cowards fight they that advance to libertys defense find double vigor in their innocence invading swedes will never once prevail till polands peace at home begins to fail the way to make poland unhappy is to follow the poets prescriptions and persuade all men to be in love with his shammoderations and to advance to libertys defense in his scheme of politics is for us to turn levellers and bring the established constitution to such a pass that we may all equal in power and share the direction of affairs alike without any thing like a kingly government which this pretended peace at home may bring us to at last without the interposition of such patriots whom he calls degenerate palatines  long may augustus wear the polish crown and poland his triumphant glories own his council steady and his statesmen just when these are happy once the monarch must i join with him in the prayer though we are of two minds concerning the justice of the statesmen for the world just falls under a different acceptance with men of different principles  if there is a statesman honest and upright whom neither knaves can bribe nor fools invite who with unbiased hands can hold the reins and seeks to save his countries lost remains that loves the people and obeys the crown and seeks the nations safety not his own unhappy poland find the hero out court him let great augustus court him to it let no state niceties prevent his choice all poland calls him with united voice heaven send her majesty such persons about her royal person amen says the church of england from the bottom of her heart who looks upon the queen as her nursing mother as well as daughter while the dissenters speak after this way for form sake only and from the teeth outward since knavery and dishonesty is the support of their cause  it is done the polish genius has prevailed and heaven has this new blessing just entailed not all the swedes invading troops shall awe the loyal poles their duty to withdraw confederate lords with their disloyal train shall always make the vile attempt in vain while heaven directs augustus to apply to men of council men of honesty ts a certain sign there is deliverance nigh we pretend not to so much as to insinuate that her majesty having suspected persons about her such as take bribes etc contrary to her declaration at her accession to the throne but that notwithstanding we are very happy in the present ministry we might likewise have been so if those that are removed from it had continued in it  how happy is augustus in his choice that makes the swedes repine the poles rejoice see how the secret black cabals abate and quit their councils to avoid their fate the malcontents discern their vile mistake and old degenerate principles forsake see how for early pardon now they sue and their allegiance openly renew what has satyr to do in viewing the man that deserves your panegyric prithee daniel leave off this way of writing or you will bring in satyr so often that your writings will be a satyr upon your self at last  the happy monarch sees the cloud disperse and distant peace shall gild the universe the poles their loyalty begin to show but satyr view the men that made it so if the gentlemen pointed at in this paragraph held any secret caballs they were for the good of church and state and they are so far from forsaking their own principles that taught them the continuance of their duty without any such thing as the renewing their allegiance that they are inseparable from them as heat is from fire or sensation from the soul  a princes choice of ministry and state determines both his wisdom and his fate wise councils may a weaker prince restore but none has these but what were wise before we agree with him that the fate of prince and people depends upon the choice of a ministry and that wise councils may support a weak prince but must deny the consequence that none but a wise prince can have a wise ministry since he has owned in this very paragraph that a weak one may be restored by one that is wise  grave casimir revolving and sedate the dyets marshal placed in finskys seat this guides the treasure that directs the state by casamir he seems to hint at the l  h  t  who he says placed mr s  h  y in the e  of n  ms place when we cannot but know those offices of trust such as a sec  of s  are wholly and solely in the gift of the crown  augustus has found out the happy two that his abstracted interest can pursue employ their abler heads tassist his crown regard his interest and neglect their own with equal zeal in polands safety join may all that love augustus thus combine that they are a happy two must be taken for granted since they are not only in the princes favor and peoples too but we are not to inter from but to say they neglect their own interest out of regard to the queens is an impardonable absurdity because the interest of queen and people are inseparable  no secret crime their personal virtue stains no swedish poisoned blood infects their veins strangers to avarice they are well described with hearts untainted and with hands unbribd this is a compliment they themselves will not allow of for sin is a crime and there is no man not the archb  p himself without it which is enough to infer from thence that all mankind in general are guilty of some secret crime or other  the polish greatness is their true design how long has poland mourned for two such men that count the nations happiness their own retrieve our credit and support out throne our bankrupt funds and mortgaged cash restore and make us rich by that which made us poor the nations joy in their advancements seen and growing triumphs crown the peaceful reign the want of money makes all men poor and if they can make us rich by that want which made us poor then all contradictions whatsoever my be resolved by this arcanum  long may augustus their just cares enjoy till their true measures all his ears destroy till all livonian plots in embrios lie abortive treasons in conception dye traitors surrender to unerring low and swedish troops from polish lands withdraw a universal satisfaction shines and coming peace appears in their designs a flowing cash will due success secure it is this alone must end the swedish war for things are altered fightings grown absurd it is now the purse that conquers not the sword and he that can the polish wealth advance strikes at the root of swedeland and of france there is no happiness that the church of england wishes her majesty not mistress of who makes it her continual prayers that not so much as the talk of a plot scotch or english may be heard in her auspicious reign and that money is the nerves of war has been a received truth since fighting is become mercenary no man of any rational faculties will so much as question  this casimir has done and this alone has changed so much of late the smiling sense these are the agents of the polish peace to these we freely own our happiness firmly the willing poles to these adhere love em with joy and trust em without fear fixtly the general interest they pursue with faithful vigor public business do for this beloved by pole and cossack too we grant him that the noble p  rs represented by the borrowed name of casimir has done more than could be expected in a treasury that had been exhausted by depreations in the late reign and while either of two worthy patriots continue in their posts without giving us any cause of fear and distrust that they ought to be beloved by poles and cossacks too  the conclusion of all the needful helps to sovereign rule the usefullst thing in poland is a fool among the utensils of government no tool like him supplies the grand intent when he is in close cabal and council set to turn the monstrous windmill of the state the huge unweildy tottering fabric stands too solid for his head too heavy for his hands the force reverts and with the swift recoil assuming statesmen perish in the broil so mischief like the high returning tide brings sure destruction on it is authors head as engineers that ill support their mind sink in the ruin of their own design if the usefullest thing in poland is a fool then a wise man is a fool for wise persons at the helm of government are the usefullest things we can hope for  poland how strangely has thy land been blessed by fools redeemed when ever by knaves oppress the graver blockheads of thy tottering state protect thy fame and help to make thee great for when they might thy government oerthrow the harmless things themselves alone undo the untraind politicians court their fate if knaves were never fools they would soon blow up the state that is very strange indeed to be redeemed by fools and almost as much as to say when we were at the brink of ruin by a parcel of knaves who shared the administration in king jamess reign the fools interposed in our behalf and brought about the late r  vol  n  here men the dignity of folly gain and never live without their wits in vain the empty head and noisy tongue appear a step to fame and dubs a polish peer coxcombs of hug uncommon size we find and fools beyond the rate of human kind no nation can such happy blackheads show ecols of design and fools of learning too with necessary dullness so supplied their want of brains has all their vice destroyed so gravely silly so refindly dull so clear the head and yet so thick the skull so damned to forms and so tied up to rules poland shall vye with all the world for fools in council hasty in performance slow no nation such a breed of fools can show purseproud and fanciful they boast of sense a certain sign it is but a vain pretense loss of discretions their chief happiness no men that want their brains can want them less so that follys a dignity and dubs a polish peer which is a sort of pettytreason because it is the queen alone who dubs a commoner a peer and insinuates as if her sacred majesty was guilty of shortsightedness in the distribution of her royal favors and could not distinguish a wise man from a fool retrabas aut vapules mi poetula  these are the manufactures of the land the props on which our polish freedoms stand that many a polish province represent and joined with knaves make up a polish parliament that help to puzzle causes in the house and hunt a question as a fox a goose strange miracles they often times perform and calm the diet when it is in a storm meersky and grand experment often made has made them laugh and rage be pleased and mad nature made fools a dernier high resort to temper men of sense and make them sport like davids harp they can the nation doze and drive the devil from the crazy house to compare a fool
