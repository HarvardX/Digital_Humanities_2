so to your grace it will be the greatest satisfaction and encouragement to  your graces most humble and obedient servant richard boulton  some thoughts concerning the unusual qualities of the air etc since all creatures who have the faculty of respiration and live upon the superficies of this terrestrial globe and inhabit the several climates of the known world are obliged to breathe the common air or atmosphere they live in and since not only those but mankind whose lives are more particularly valuable as a creature of the most noble and first rank are subject to be altered and variously affected according to the different qualities of that air and to receive different impressions accordingly as that is impregnated and endowed with several various extraneous bodies vapors or efflusions and since these are not only likely to affect human bodies externally through the pores of the skin but internally when sucked into the lungs into more tender and rarified vessels containing humors more exquisitely rarified and expanded and consequently are liable to be altered and depraved according to the various dispositions of that air we breathe which may lay the foundations of disorders and distempers pernicious and destructive to human bodies as those extraneous bodies vapors or effluviums are more or less unwholesome and of a different nature i say since human bodies are thus disposed and liable to be ill affected and disordered by the various qualities of the air we breathe it is not only necessary but requisite we should consider the different qualities of that air and what extraneous bodies vapors or effluviums it may be impregnated and endowed with and what alterations or ill effects these may occasion and produce either at the present or for the future and how far they may be prejudicial and pernicious to mankind  to determine and enable us to judge of the different qualities of the air and what extraneous bodies or vapors it may be impregnated and endowed with we are to consider how many ways it may be furnished with such vapors or effluviums which must be either from foreign globes far distant from the earth we live in and from the superficies of our atmosphere from extraneous bodies or vapors emitted or rising from bodies on the superficies of our globe or from vapors and effluviums transuding and ascending out of the bowels of the earth  as for those globes which are vastly distant from the earth we live in and far remote from the superficies of our atmosphere these are either the stars the moon or the sun  the stars are so many thousand miles distant from us and separated by such a spacious and boundless ether or medium that we can but just perceive the glimmering rays of those celestial bodies which are sufficient to convince us that there are such stupendous effects of an infinite power but they are so small that they can have but little effects in altering the qualities of the air we breathe much less are they able to inform us of the nature of those distarit globes and consequently cannot afford us any knowledge what alterations such can produce only we may conclude that where the causes are small and scarce perceivable the effects must be inconsiderable and therefore can do little good except as luminaries or produce not much ill and consequently cannot contribute much to pervert it or deprave the disposition of our air or atmosphere  as for the moon though that is much nearer than any of the stars yet it is also placed at a great distance from the superficies of the earth and separated by a vast extent of fine ether which interposes betwixt that globe and ours and prevents it from any immediate effects upon the air we live in and though several effects are attributed to it because the periods seem to keep time with its different positions yet it is contrary to all known laws statical or hydrostatical that it should have any effect upon any bodies contained within our atmosphere as having no immediate contact with terrene bodies but only upon that ether which equally encompasses and compresses the superficies of our vortex and the utmost extent of the globe we live and breathe upon or in for the air or atmosphere may be properly said to be a part of our globe though the most fluid and rarified superficial covering of earth and water and though lunaticks or those distempers which grow worse at certain periods seem to be equal in distance with the several positions of the moon yet it cannot be demonstrated that those effects are owing to it as a cause since other periodical distempers keep an equal distance betwixt their periods which depend upon causes contained within the limits of our own bodies and as for the ebbing and flowing of the sea that must proceed from some other cause both statical and hydrostatical rules excluding it any share in these different motions of that fluid element but not to enter upon disputes of that nature which are foreign to our present purpose we shall only observe that the beams of the moon which illuminate our globe are only reflected beams of the sun transmitted into our atmosphere and not the proper emanations or effluviums of that globe and for as much as the beams of the sun reflected from other substances within our globe do not transmit to us the nature of those bodies they are reflected from but are only variously modifyd and refracted in the superficies of those bodies which different refractions variously affect our sensory or the organ of sights and produce the sensation of different colors or refractions and which only affect the sense of seeing as they are stronger or weaker consequently we cannot expect that the beams of the sun reflected from the superficies of the moon should convey to us the qualities of that body or globe especially since they are likewise conveyed through so fine a strainer as the interposed ether and refracted and altered also in passing through the great and lofty expanded part of our atmosphere which is reckoned or computed to be seven miles perpendicular in height boying up a pillar of quicksilver in a weatherglass such a considerable height till it amounts to an aequilibrium or equal weight of a pillar of air of the same diameter and thickness pressing upon the basis or bottom of that pipe the mercury or quicksilver is contained in  as for the sun it is evident that it acts upon all bodies within our atmosphere by virtue of its heat since in the summer time when it is near enough it rarifies expands and digests the superficial juices of the earth as well those in our bodies which when fermented attenuated and rarified are pressed by the force of the incumbent atmosphere into the roots of plants and trees and rise higher as further rarified pressed and expanded in the vessels of each plant which being variously fermented and strained through different vessels along with specific juices are assimilated and converted into the proper juices of those plants  the sun beams also affect other bodies on the superficies of the earth and by their active parts put the parts of other substances in motion and causes them to emit vapors and effluviums which according to their different natures variously alter and affect the air we breathe and render it more or less wholesome and pernicious healthful or destructive but though the sun has such considerable effects upon this globe when near us yet when but a little further off in the winter we see that it has little or no apparent effects upon the climate we live in and if so small a difference can extinguish the obvious effects of so bright a body as the sun we can scarce imagine that the moon or stars which are much further off and shine but faintly should have any considerable effects or indeed any at all especially since they cannot be perceived  it appearing hence in a great measure how the air we breathe may be altered by foreign globes far distant from our earth we are next to consider how the air we breathe in may be altered and depraved by vapors and effluviums emitted and arising from the superficies of the globe we inhabit which appears from the vast variety of different substances which may be observed on the superficies of the globe we live upon which deprave the natural temper and disposition of the air and consequently variously affect the mass of humors circulating through the minute and small vessels contained in and dispersed through the substance of the lungs such as putrified bodies and the constant emanation of vapors occasioned by standing waters and the unwholesome stenches which naturally flow from the products of art as well as nature which more particularly affect those persons employed in such arts and more immediately exercised about them thus we see the strange decay in those persons which work in pothouses chemical elaboratories and other employments where they are exposed to unwholesome vapors and preternartural fumes and these are further improved to an ill purpose and grow more pernicious and unwholesome and deprave the wholesome dispositon of the air when more forceably put in action by the united force and heat of the sun beams  but the greatest and most considerable alteration which the air receives from the extraneous mixture of vapors and effluviums seems to be from such as transude and ascend out of the bowels of the earth whether of a mineral kind or of any other nature and as such sort of vapors and effluviums are most likely to produce great and extraordinary alterations so conesquently those alterations are probably most pernicious and of the worst consequence and aptest to occasion the worst of accidents in human bodies  from such kind of vapors differvently agitated and put in action by the nearer approach or greater distance of the sun seems to arise that great variety of climates not only in the same latitude but several parts of the terrestrial globe for accordingly as the air is variously affected with such effluviums of different kinds these vapors being put in action by the heat of the sun beams produce different effects and render the air in such climates more or less wholesome pernicious and depraved thus agues are more frequent in kent and other distempers more common and custommary in different parts of the world  when by the constant and customary transmission of particular vapors and effluviums any country is frequently or constantly subject to such diseases these distempers are said to be endemical or proper to that particular climate but when contagious or malignant distempers happen to rage more than commonly or accidentally in any place such disorders are called epidemical or spreading at some particular times arising from the accidental discharge and ascension of particular vapors out of the bowels of the earth at that time  the temper of the air in different climates is also altered differently according to the quantity as well as quality of such vapors and as the air is more plentifully or sparingly impregnated with such preternatural vapors which also in the same climates exert themselves more or less vigorously according to the different seasons of the year thus in summer time contagious or malignant distempers rage more vigorously and universally and are less epidemical in the winter  and as the temper and disposition of the air varies according to different climates the various quantities of mineral effluviums and the different seasons of the year so we find a vast difference according to the nature and qualities of such mineral vapors some minerals afford very wholesome and salutiferous steams whilst others are dangerous and pernicious thus the mines in cornwall make the country wholesome and healthful whilst others produce contagious and pestilential qualities which render such countries frequently subject to such distempers  those mineral effluviums or vapors which produce pestilential diseases are of a most pernicious kind and are attended with very violent and most fatal symptoms and such are esteemed by that most worthy and profound judge of the works of nature the honorable robert boil to be of an arsenical kind producing effects of the most malignant and poisonous nature being most offensive and destructive to human bodies  it appearing then from what we have said that the temper of the air and its most unusual qualities which are likewise most destructive and dangerous chiefly depend on the effluviums or vapors rising out of the bowels of the earth whenever we find the temper and disposition of any climate to vary and differ from what it commonly does in such climates we have good reason to conclude that the air is impregnated with some unusual effluviums out of the bowels of this terrestrial globe which being mixed with and dispersed through the air produce that uncommon indisposition  and since we are constantly obliged to breathe the air we live in and to impregnate our blood with such heterogeneous and offensive particles which perverting the course of nature may produce ill effects in human bodies we ought to be very careful to guard our selves against such accidents as may be destructive and so prejudicial to mankind and to make use of necessary precautions to prevent such ill accidents as such inconveniences may render us liable to  it cannot be out of our memory what fatal consequences have lately happened abroad especially in the south parts of france and how many thousands have been destroyed by the fatal effects of an ill disposed temper of the air so mortal and epidemical and as other parts of the world may be likely to suffer by accidents and may be liable to the same approaching dangers by hidden vapors and effluviums transmitted from the inward parts of the earth and by mineral effluviums of a malignant kind whenever we find any unusual quality in the air we have a great deal of reason to be afraid of some unusual accidents and to make use of all necessary precautions to prevent them if such ill and malignant qualities should be conveyed from the inward parts of the earth into our atmosphere such cautionary preparations would arm us the better against their ill effects and though no such danger as we might justly fear should happen yet at least we should reap this advantage by our jealous surmises that we should free our bodies of ill disposed humors and put our selves in a better state and condition of health so that our labor would not be ill bestowed and fruitless nor our pains ill rewarded the just cautions to arm our selves against the greatest of dangers would at least secure us against less evils  and that at the present we have very probable grounds and substantial reasons to fear some impending evil and future danger which may too suddenly happen in our climate and consequently we ought to make use of proper methods to prevent such events will in a great measure appear if we consider the steps arid progress of malignant or pestilential distempers in former times and also the intemperies of our climate for some time past and at the present time which may give us sufficient grounds to suspect the consequential intemperature of the air for the future or time to come  as for the steps and progress of malignant or pestilential distempers formerly it has been observed that the pestilence took its course successively through several parts of europe beginning first in asia and then running through italy germany denmark sweden england etc in turkey it is endemical and constantly appears every year but this in a great measure depends on the excessive heats of the climate and their way of living their blood being too much phlegmated to support and supply a sufficient diaphoresis or swear in the time of excessive heat and this is in a great measure occasioned by their abstinence according to mahomets laws from spiritous liquors which might sufficiently attenuate the serum of the blood and render it apt for transpiration so that when the mass of humors begin to be fermented with hear the phlegmatic parts of the whole are too great in quantity and too gross in quality to be discharged according to the ordinary course of nature  but it appeared lately in france without any mask or excuse to hide the evident cause of its malignancy it plainly appearing to proceed from contagious parts of matter dispersed through the air which from what has been said appear to be supplied by subterraneous mineral effluviums or vapors proceeding out of the bowels of the earth which god almighty preserve us from  but it is too much to be feared that some heterogeneous particles or malignant vapors and effluviums have and are too much dispersed through our atmosphere or the air which we now breathe in our climate and this will appear too likely if we observe that near the whole twelve months last past the nitrous parts of the air have almost been totally overpowered and hindered from producing their natural effects as usual in this climate for we may observe that most of the last summer was not only hot and dry but that most of the last winter appeared more like summer than winter weather there being little appearance of either frost or snow to what is usual in this climate and we at the present find that the heat of the weather has some time exceeded what it has for several years last past which if it should increase proportionally as the sun approaches it must render the hottest season of the year excessively so and consequently must produce exceeding malignant distempers if not pestilential  and that we may reasonably conclude that such intemperatures of the air proceed from subterraneous vapors or effluviums which not only overpower the nitrous parts of the air but are put and excited into a preternatural fermentation by the heat of the sun i say we may reasonably deduce this conclusion since the sun would have its constant and certain effect at the same distance and consequently that the differences must proceed from some heterogeneous particles which concur to produce such alterations and differences in the natural disposition of the air in one climate  and that the air is too much impregnated with some heterogeneous vapors is evident from the maladies which have lately afflicted several persons as particular feverish heats and indispositions attended with pains in the head and dizziness and other symptoms much different from those which appear in phthisis or any usual distempers  if then as we may well conclude or at least suspect the air we breathe is impregnated with heterogeneous particles as it seems to appear not only from what we have mentioned but the sudden and surprising death of several persons especially of lare since we continually such in and imbibe these heterogeneous particles into our blood in respiration it seems worth our while to consider what methods are proper to prevent their ill effects it either it should happen that the air should be more plentifully impregnated with such particles or by long breathing them into our lungs the mass of blood should be more strongly impregnated with them so as to enable them to produce their ill effects more vigorously  in order to assign proper methods to this purpose it will be requisite to consider what causes commonly concur to produce malignant pestilential distempers front whence it will appear what methods may be proper and most expedient to prevent such maladies and to secure mankind from such dangers as may happen without the overruling hand of providence to divert such pernicious qualities which may be more plentifully emitted out of the bowels of the earth and dispersed through the infected air we breathe in  and first from what has been said it appears sufficiently that the antecedent cause of malignant or pestilential distempers depends on and is composed of extraneous malignant mineral vapors or exhalations rising out of the bowels of the earth and impregnating the air we breathe with pernicious particles  these mineral effluviums or vapors first and primarily affect human bodies and being sucked into the lungs in breathing gradually impregnate the whole mass of blood with their poisonous steams  these poisonous particles of mineral vapors at the first are so small in quantity that they are not able to produce any ill effects being lodged and harbored amongst the more phlegmatic and gross parts of the animal humors but being gradually collected to a greater quantity they exert themselves more powerfully and the gross parts of the blood being attenuated and subtilised by their corrosive qualities or at least some part of them they are no longer able to cloak and skreen them from showing their corrosive qualities  the mass of blood being thus gradually more strongly impregnated with these depraved and heterogeneous particles and some parts of the mass of humors attenuated by their corrosive qualities they begin to discover those qualities run them into a more fluid form by their corrosive faculty and separating them from the rest the perfect mixture of the mass of humors is by this means broke and made an imperfected mixture the grosser parts being cast off and separated from the thinner and by this means rendered unapt and unfit for circulation the grosser parts occasion obstructions in the small and minutest vessels whilst the more thin and corrosive corrode and destroy the continuity of the vessels whose joint effects make such a sad catastrophe in human bodies and putting the whole fabric into disorder produce those ill symptoms in pestilential and malignat distempers as tumors ulcers inflammations deliriums mortifications and death in the glandulous parts they produce buboes in the fleshy pares carbuncles and blotches in the nervous parts especially the membranes of the brain inflammation delirium and phrensy in the glandulous parts of the brain and other noble parts violent symptoms and sudden death  these malignant and pestilential distempers being thus formed and the blood strongly impregnated with destructive vapors as well as the air the distemper begins to be more contagious and spreading the ill effluviums heaped up in human bodies now exerting themselves powerfully and breaking out of those repositories unite with those contained in the air and more strongly affect those persons about them and thus the infection is spread and promoted secondarily these effluviums from human bodies uniting with those contained in the air and those already collected in the mass of blood  but besides these primary and secundary antecedent causes to produce malignant and pestilential distempers there are other accessory and concurring causes requisite for since all are not equally subject to them but several continue a long time amongst such persons without prejudice till at the last their constitutions are gradually depraved and more strongly affected with the venomous exhalations  this accessory concurring cause must be a particular disposition in the blood to retain and be affected by these infectious vapors or effluviums of the earth and human bodies otherwise all people would be equally subject to be infected at the same time to discover this disposition we are to consider that whatever is contained in the mass of blood as long as is thin enough to circulate through the vessels there is no danger of obstruction and consequently there can no damage happen except it be too thin and corrosive and opening the extremities or otherwise corroding and destroying the continuity of the vessels occasions an extravasation but even to produce that effect the humors must be very sharp before they can break the vessels as long as they circulate freely since they stay not long enough in any part to produce that effect and therefore we may well conclude that there must be viscocity also in the blood and that those viscous parts being either too thick to circulate or separate from the rest first cause an obstruction and detain these corrosive humors the perfect mixture of the blood being first broke and destroyed by those contagious parts  indeed when the vessels are too much crowded and extended with humors as in plethorick bodies corrosive particles crowded and impelled by the force of circulation into the small pores of the vessels may too much extend them and contribute to separate and divide the continuity of their parts but since there is naturally a viscocity in the blood and serum and this may be and frequently is too great this united with those corrosive qualities and retaining them will give them a greater opportunity of corrosion thus a viscous phlegm retaining a sharp humor upon the top of the stomach or ventricle where there is a plentiful distribution of nerves causes a corroding pain at the stomach called heartburn and in the membranes about the musculous parts occasions rheumatick pains especially where they are most sensible and incapable of extension and the membranes of the joints corroded with a sharp or austere viscous matter produce those excessive pains of the gout where the obstruction so much retains those sharp humors that they corrode the vessels in pieces and occasion such an extravasation of this viscous matter as to produce and form nodes  from hence it plainly appearing that a predisposition in the blood is an accerssory concurring cause and that this predisposed humor is a viscous gross humor which retains and heaps up the contagious particles of the air we imbibe and draw in with our breath it consequently follows that the conjunct cause or matter of the disease is contagious particles lodged first in a viscous humor which was an accessory antecedent cause and disengaged or separated from the sharp humor and causing obstructions becomes along with that sharp contagious humor a conjunct cause and both together make up the material cause or the morbifick matter of the disorder and distemper which according to the degrees produces more malignant diseases and when abounding in an extraordinary degree even the pestilence which is so obnoxious and fatal to mankind  and that a viscous matter along with the contagious particles is the conjunct cause and produces malignant and pestilential distempers is evident from hence since all people are not equally subject to such distempers and some never have any at all though they live in a contagious air and amongst infected persons and that a viscous predisposition of blood is necessary as a concurring cause is manifest for as long as the humors are sufficiently attenuated though sharp corrosive particles are imbibed into the blood and mixed with it in respiration they are soon discharged and separated from it again by the common emunctories and discharges of nature as by sweat transpiration urine or stool before they can have any time or power to alter and corrupt the blood by destroying its texture and mixture for the constant agitation and circulation of the blood preserves its mixture along time when kept in perpetual motion but when the blood is too thick it retains a greater quantity hinders the natural discharge and consequently tends to heap up infectious particles  besides when the blood abounds with viscous parts it produces a larger discharge or separation of phlegmatic parts when its texture and mixture is imperfect which occasion obstructions and concur to produce malignant symptoms when thrown critically upon the minute vessels or glands of any part  when any such critical discharge is made and a malignant or pestilential distemper is formed and properly in esse or factu that is perfectly formed the antecedent conjunct and accessory causes along with the symptoms produced make up the formal cause which is the disease and its symptoms  but to complete this there is one cause accessory which is the procatartick cause or that which puts the antecedent causes in action as any sudden passion of the mind and the ill use of nonnaturals or the force of imagination but that which is chiefly so and external is the approaching heat and activity of the sun beams which put those contagious effluviums vapors or exhalations in action more briskly by increasing the degrees of fermentation or digestion the consequence of which we may justly fear and dread for if such contagious effluviums are in the air and should increase it may reasonably be feared that contagious distempers may happen more or less malignant if not pestilential according to the degrees of the primary antecedent cause viz extraneous mineral exhalations vapors or effluviums from which god almighty or art must preserve us if they should by the course of natural causes break forth  from what has been said it appears what just cause we have to dread the ill consequences of contagious vapors which we may too reasonably suspect it may therefore be requisite to consider what methods are most proper to prevent and avert the event and consequences of such dreadful causes which may easily be deduced from what has been said for if contagious vapors are retained by a viscous indisposition of blood and sharp corrosive humors or vapors collected and run into a fluor destroy the texture and mixture of the blood and by this means produce the symptoms of malignant or pestilential distempers the proper intentions to prevent such accidents must be to correct and discharge that viscous matter which retains contagious vapors as well as to correct and prevent the ill effects of those infectious effluviums it being impossible either to prevent mineral exhalations which is the primary antecedent cause or to hinder and obstruct the suns approach which is the principal procatartick cause though sometimes the antecedent cause when increased to a great degree and plentifully heaped up may also be a procatartick cause and put it self in action  since then the principal intentions to prevent malignant or pestilential distempers are to remove the natural indisposition which retains contagious vapors and to correct those vapors or malignant particles which destroy the texture of the blood and produce such fatal consequences we are to consider what is most reasonable to be done  as for the air it is of such vast extent and the superficies of the earth so large that it will be hard to deal with so extensive a subject physically but in the compass of a human body we may be more likely to deal with them  as for the predisposition of the blood which renders human bodies most likely to retain them and to heap up contagious particles since that is a viscous humor it is obvious to those who have taken pains in physic what intentions are requisite to that purpose as bleeding and purging for bleeding emptying the vessels makes room for fluids to dilute and thin the rest and purging discharges a grosser humor than passes off by any other natural way which nature makes use of  and to correct those contagious vapors which may already be heaped up in the blood or may hereafter be contracted since they woud pass off if nothing was in the way to obstuct them without destroying the texture of the blood since thin humors flow best off by diaphoresis or through the pores of the skin when the gross humors are removed by bleeding and purgeing alexipharmick diaphoreticks seem most proper for that purpose which may correct those malignant vapors and discharge them and consequently preserve the texture and due mixture of the blood and prevent those malignant and fatal consequences  as for particular forms for this purpose i need not direct physicians they being able to prescribe for themselves but every body not being physicians or able or willing to employ them as too expensive i shall recommend some medicines convenient for that purpose to the use of those who think it worth their while to preserve their health and guard themselves from future ill consequences  and as i said before it may not be amiss to pursue such measures for they will at least have this advantage that if pestilential distempers happen not they will still guard themselves from the dangers of malignant distempers which will be worth their while and reward their care of their health and preseve a good constitution  indeed for the sake of those who cannot afford to employ a physician i should have laid down forms for their use that they might apply themselves to apothecaries but some of them are too apt to adulterate medicines and leave out any ingredients that are dear though most useful and necessary besides in the several books i have already writ i have been so free that way that several though they have made use of them to their advantage yet they have not had the civility to acknowledge the freedom in a way customary to those who have been educated in physic though it has been the whole business and study of my life since i left school education  if therefore any one shall think it worth their while to take care of their health and guard themselves from future ill consequences after bleeding to attenuate the humors to discharge the viscous humor though i hate any thing that looks like common quackery notwithstanding the art of physic was built upon it i shall recommend particular medicines for that purpose already prepared with directions for their use yet if any shall apply themselves to me for advise i shall not scruple to prescribe let them make use of who they please but to proceed from this accidental digression  the properest purge which i should recommend upon this occasion is dr sagittarys elixir a medicine of excellent use and discharging obnoxious humors with a great deal of safety this ought to be taken once or twice a week working gently and by making a gradual discharge without too much force upon nature and therefore most agreeable to human bodies i have no interest in recommending this excellent medicine but only the good of mankind  those days which are free from purging they may take an antimalignant and antipestilential tincture which will correct those contagious vapors and expel them out of the blood gently through the pores of the skin without the trouble or force of immoderate sweat or any sensible sweating at all taking a spoonful every morning and at night going to bed in a glass of wine and water or wine only or in beer if any shall like it rather  it also preserves the due mixture and crasis of the mass of blood and humors preserving human bodies from contagious infection whether from those more malignant or pestilential effluviums or vapors dispersed through the air from the superficial or subterraneous parts of the earth or from the bodies of infected persons  it also preserves human bodies in such a perfect state of health tha it prevents and guards them from the ill effects of such less indispositions and intemperatures as occasion and render mens bodies liable to agu or intermitting fevers as in ke or essex where it will be of singular and universal use if frequentl made use of in those climates  it will likewise if frequently mad use of contribute to prevent the spreading of that contagious and infectious distemper the smallpox or at least render the bood of so wholesome a disposition by cleansing it of its impurities that if it does not totally prevent them yet it will render them less virulent or much milder and less dangerous and prevent the unnecessary hazard and danger of inoculation a new contrived practice which only forestalls future by present sickness and hastens on that inconveniency which would be effected or happen at a greater distance of time or perhaps not at all  and that the smallpox depends on a particular disposition of the air which destroys the due mixture of the mass of blood and makes an alteration in its texture is very evident since we see that this disease is often times epidemical and rages more universally at one time than another  and that the disposition of the air in this case destroys the texture of the blood appears from the symptoms of it for we see that the grosser particles of the blood in that disease are not only separated from the rest but that they are critically cast off in the glands of the skin which evidently appears since as the air is impregnated with particular vapors milder or more sharp and biteing the pox are of a benign kind or corrosive and occasion pits or exulcerations which leave disfiguring marks behind them  but in this distemper there is not only a depraved indisposition in the air but likewise a predisposition in the mass of humors is requisite which from the symptoms appears to be viscous and to depend perhaps on the faults of digestion and crudities thus congested in their infancy but this we have not time or room to consider thoroughly  i shall only add that to prevent this distemper the purgeing elixir may be used once a week and the tincture beforementioned those days that are free from purgeing and for some time after which are also frequently to be repeated the quantity to be proportioned according to the persons age directions for which will be given along with that tincture  of the differences of contagious vapors  since in the foregoing sheets we have taken notice that malignant and contagious distempers depend on and are occasioned by pernicious vapors and exhalations rising out of the bowels or the superficial parts of the earth impregnating the air we breathe and acting upon bodies preindisposed and furnished with vicious depraved humors we shall briefly add something of the differences of those contagious vapors and exhalations which produce these different effects the effects varying as we before took notice according to the variety of the causes  and first watery exhalations render the air thick and moist and obnoxious to athmatick persons and those that have moist lungs these with nitrous acid effluviums occasion agues the famous mr boil observing that a particular acid mixed with a volatile produces a cold effervency in the smallpox the mixture of the blood is broke by vitriolick vapors or effluviums which appears from the curdling effects which produce tumors in the skin and also from the nauseous smell attending that disease malignant fevers depend on a higher degree of corrosive mineral salts producing a higher degree of crudities and much more than nature can digest throw off or discharge in pestilential distempers the effluviums are of a more malignant kind and rather of an arsenical nature producing symptoms of a proportionable degree of malignancy and more pernicious  how these malignant effects may be prevented we have already observed and where this tincture may be had i shall annex by way of adverment  finis n b this
