the fancid  an heroic poem in six cantos  to his grace the duke of marlborough on the turn of his genius to arms  up sword and know thou a more proper time hamlet london printed for j osborn at the golden bail in paternoster row mdccxliii  the preface it will be easily perceived why no address by way of dedication could be proper to this poem yet the verses ought perhaps to have been offered before printed to the view of one great family lest among ideas of so complicated a variety there should be some wherewith it might not as to point of delicacy have been found eligible to associate names of such sincere distinction and importance but the writer recollected that the mere omission of an act of ceremony could not equitably be complained of in a poem where he has not arrogated to himself the freedom to give praise or censure all that points at either one or other being narrative recital only and that too from the voices of such speakers as the public daily hears expressing more upon both subjects than they are represented in this place as uttering  as to the general disposition of the purpose if any too bold strokes of liberty should chance to be suspected in it let it be remembered in the writers favor that he is no better than an empty visionary and this is not the first time that a man in a dream has been a very impertinent fellow who in his waking intervals has kept within the bounds of due decorum  concerning luxury especially none ought to make the muse accountable for what she prattles in her sleep since it is about a power she never corresponds with but in slumber and if trade is touchy and will not bear to have it credited that daughters come by means of mothers  who could shun the hazard of offending such a choleric petulance  the writer had no license to restrain or castrate sentiments he but reports from personages to whom his country owes a reverence that forbids the boldness of curtailing their ideas  neither has he given the captious coquette abovenamed the least occasion of offense without hardstraining and partiality for who can look upon it as an undervaluing of trade that she is represented as not overmuch disposed to carry arms herself nor overfond indeed of those she pays for carrying them  authorities enough might probably be found to prove plain truth no slander but he rather pleads the merit of that prophesied expedient toward the end of the vth canto for a perfect reconciliation between the drum and warehouse  if notwithstanding this the waking poet must be charged with the vagaries of his dreaming muse he can but borrow comfort from this titfortat reflection  that since trade is naturally disposed to think with dullness and contempt of poetry the poet in his turn may by right of equivalent assume the same dull privilege and prate as foolishly of traffic  to pass at once from poetry  to prose and truth and serious history  the great and noblyjudging lady to whom in the vith canto an advice of no small consequence is offered by a bold though naked friend of whom she never yet was known to be ashamed however bare and out of fashion she approached her will reflect with some attention on the proposition after hearing what foundation it was grounded on  about the year      a private person not worth naming but an ardent lover of his countrys reputation became difpossessd of a mistaken notion which had been at first imbibed by conversation with the prejudiced but gradually confirmed and heightened by much reading speculation and reflection upon military subjects that the most celebrated english conqueror of this last age it might i think be added without flattery above any of the former was not premeditatively and by force of his superior skill the author of his own unprecedented victories  the mistaker grounded his conclusion on that great generals letters written from the fields of battle with the first accounts of his successes  it is visible beyond dispute that there one meets with none of those descriptive and explanatory circumstances whereby the skilful captains of all ages took such cautionary care to guard against unjust impressions of their conduct by unfolding it in plan in progress and accomplishment that not their fortune only but their foresight and superiority of genius might be noted in their victories it is hence that in so many of the antients and in some great moderns written narratives we see and understand minutely the whole groundplots dispositions oppositions and clear outbreak of the actions not in their bald success alone but with their previous motives their impending agitations and eventual overbalance and conclusion whereas from all the published letters of our more than equal executer of his own unequalled purposes we gather nothing further than that the army he commanded was triumphant and that he seems to think each leader in it more deserving his remark than the elucidation of his own designs in their reported execution  in a visit made about the time just mentioned to another english general a noble lord since dead at a small garden seat of his near london these observations were enlarged upon as they had often been to others in a conversation on the military character of our great favorite of fortune whom it has been thought the lord here meant had formerly regarded with some rival pangs of emulation it were therefore an ungenerous coldness to his memory to conceal the noble sentiments wherewith he closed the conversation on this subject  you have said he misunderstood his character and done it the same wrong that many thousands do and will continue to do from but the natural consequence of his sincere and modest negligence of ostentation  he thought it equally his duty to subdue the enemy and his own sensibility of triumph for subduing him  he made i think but one mistake in his field conduct but that was a mistake of such unlucky consequence that it has been able to do more against himself than ten french armies could for it obscures you see the luster of his genius  he trusted history for explanations which he should have known it could not make but in a lame and superficial manner for want of lights which he alone had power to furnish who was the only person disinclinable to wish em furnished  the impression which this truly noble answer made and the reflections which it gave occasion to have often since presented to imagination as a national misfortune the possibility of some destructive accident to those invaluable original papers which contain it is said sufficient matter in his familys possession to immortalize as well that great mans temper wisdom suavity skill modes and means of conquest as the reputation merely of the victories themselves  the last it must be owned is glory but it is a glory of a barren and unpropagative species it is the glory of a nimrod a sesostris hercules arthur and pendragon names of aweful cloudinessl

accident of such severe importance should it happen to the mentioned papers before that glorious use has been drawn from them which is hinted in the close of the last canto where that the writer may not seem impertinent he has here assigned his reasons for conceiving it both a domestic and a public duty on the care of that illustrious conquerors representatives  but where the hand is to be found

your own yes boaster france had thou but known thy day known where thy strength cluded samson lay known what resistless odds in war befriend the sons of steel where slaves of gold contend abstemious patience prides great work had done commerce had still been lost  but empire won heaven to my frighted fancy let me paint what late france was  then boast her timed restraint twenty prompt millions pressed her peopled plains who fed no factions and who felt no chains despotic power grew there in plaintless soil peasants who sung in want and danced in toil dependent nobles fired for martial fame a church all linking to one sovereign claim her sons too poor for pride too fierce for trade her king too stored to need a merchants aid vast and selfmovd on came this giant soul each part connected to propel the whole for conquest apt and panting to begin and bursting every rein that held her in i saw the alldaring power too near she stood hung over her cliffs and darkened half my flood  is there i cried in vast ambitions walk no dim proud corner where mistake might stalk with fancied forms to scare misjudging sight till shade seem substance and deception light there is  blind envy shall

step shall shake the princes throne in heavens kind ear i lodged the accepted prayer still reigns my marlbros living influence there walking with seraph powers the eternal round the immortal captain caught the imploring sound where on wars theme with michael he conferred and caesars silent soul attentive heard strait from unbounded voids of azure light where spirits freed from flesh and bleachd from night gliding from sun to sun new worlds survey that roll by millions and adorn their way the allrevrencd leader called a wily mind that left all tinge of bodied phlegm behind one that had popes and jesuits ardour fired and slowsould mufties solemn spleens inspired now stripped and naked skimmd the eternal space anxious for office and in wait for place go cried the voice seraphic faithful tried  in fleurys brainy cells thy entrance hide heedful attend where thoughts dim embryos lie fan the speckd fire  but bend its flame awry lure him the effects of powerful wealth to dread and to tried traffic turn the frenchmans head there conquering guardian of thy countrys fame blessed be thy spirit deathless be thy name there sprung the mine shall cost the unwary foe a hundred blenheims in one peaceful blow now seas and lands gauls grasping talon strains and rich obstruction cloggs her tumid veins bound down to avarice and improved for prey terror shall hesitate resolves away reclaim of rights revolt each stubborn town and sliced exemptions lop the curtailed crown heavy on slow chockd wheels the encumbered state shall drag stretched factions allretarding weight o policy shortsighted shade of skill how small thy grasp is how immense thy will who weighed the weakness of this dreaded man who marked his purpose blasted by his plan how have rash kings concurred to swell thy fame calm fleury  how begemmd thy faded name blind to thy schemes event they failed to see republics raised on ruined monarchy failed to foremark the exalted peasants tread high in trades sandals over the nobles head and this feared priest  praised idol of an hour with nursed rebellion blast his princes power so fall the lazy logs that load a throne lump lords of all mens passions but their own whose truant scape from care conceives no storm till the waves reach them and the winds deform then start they half awake stare stamp and rail void and tempestuous as the oertaking gale fierce in hot fright unhelm one erring tool and to new masters put their faith to school hail my saved sons  now smile at threatening france declined for ever by misjudgd advance one glittering weakness lightning both your scales quarrel secure while neithers weight prevails by one false maxim two fierce nations cooled  that wars tough sinews owe their strength to gold trite blindness  thousand falling states shall feel no power can ever want gold whose nerves are steel this romes old generals born for conquest knew for whom unsown earths hostile harvests grew this knew lean hunns devouring romes increase this

fear disarms how sweet thy smile how dazzling is thy glare witchcraft thy accents paradise thy air yet weakning wantonness thy slaves destroys nerveless thy votries indolent thy joys sunk and absorbed within thy soft embrace pants the lulled virtue and forgets disgrace  with sense too abject and with claim too proud thou shrinkst the noble and thou swellst the crowd too tasteful those to leave luxurious seats for sunburned marches or for seashook fleets and these too wantless to be trained to awe where mobs make magistrates and bribry law unmarked these remoras close cleaving deep hang on wars motions and retard her sweep but times slow scythe the encumbered keel shall free point the strait course and smooth the obstructed sea thou faction head by head sopsilencd fast shall rest thy heels and fold thy arms at last then unimpeded councils laboring long shall hit that martial medium safely strong where trade war power and freedom centring meet  askilld militia and a guardian fleet till then  long intervening shades i see darkness and diffidence require not me farewell  your howl shall break my rest no more bawl  till sleeps destined gag suspends your roar here stopped the genius  three wiped tears she shed and clouds descending veiled her towry head three times she sighed then lost in slow descent sunk through the embracing surges pressed extent strait dull surrounding flatness smoothed the deep hushed winds half whispering lull design to sleep fat stagnant reeks unbrace reposing air wide over armenian hills flew frighted care happy content saw fames close curtain drawn and three stretched nations shared one pangless yawn canto vi quenched and downrushing like a falling star off dropped chilled fancy from her flamy car in shrunk her fires her winged ideas die and dim suffusion darkened every eye whirled like ejected phaeton she fell and over her murmuring closed the unfathomed swell active no more the ethereal coursers neigh no more flashed lightnings mark their burning way tame hung their drooping necks each loosning trace drags false  and all the exulting nerves unbrace half the plunged harness now the sea conceals now hissing waves half quench the smoking wheels when stooping mild calm truth her danger spied snatched the saved reins  herself her surest guide up from the engulphing deeps defeated flow rose the drawn chariot  steady solemn slow beamless and bald of fires but heavenly white rich without pomp and without dazzling bright soft gliding homeward through unruffled air thus spoke the immortal to her pensive care oh paintouchd marlbro mitigate thy grief check thy warm wish till heaven prepares relief wait thy due glories born an age too late when fear grew wisdom and contempt was fate snatched to thy lettered pile indulge retreat suspend thy purpose and disarm thy heat bear back thy unpermitted power to shine while gathering darkness spreads by doom divine while genius quits an unaspiring race where war is pinioned and corruption grace where solids sinking only bubbles swim where fame is quixotism and virtue whim yet be thy bravry blessed that dared intend blessed thy skilled means that matched thy patriot end blessed thy souls generous start from home to flame expansive for redress of alien shame and was there could there be whose angry zeal disclaimed this fervor or declined to feel which widning with a gods impartial call left some dissatisfied to care for all oh hushed forever be the rash complaint that saw such greatness with an eye so faint  is there a breast overwhelmed with willing woe that can for public private joys forego sigh for his pains o world  since one who bears for all  gives all distress by separate shares shame on that locked recess in partys cell where groveling pique and browbent censure dwell where inlookd arrogance sits crippling sense helped by pained pride and angry eminence laboring each heave of pitys heart to quell and squeeze whole nature into selfs hard shell o spleen  thy gall has reasons mark effaced till human weakness measures truth by taste our deeds catch color from opinions hue and right and wrong take name from place and view these are thy triumphs thou detractive cheat cloakd faction perched in freedoms sullied seat narrowd contraction suits thy shortened sight as owls owe eyebeams to the dusk of night lost to perception of the souls extent thou feelst no greatness stretched beyond thy bent merit thou tryst by service guilt by hate callst malice vigilance and knavry weight worth in a foe thy eyes want strength to see and no tear touches till it flows for thee such are the scales in which the great are weighed and by such optics is the muse surveyed yet spite of envy slander wrongs and time the great shall triumph and the muse shall climb when the pale meteors of a states dark day fall from their heights and steam their stench away when all the chancemixd mobs of power shall die and lost in titled dust forgotten lie when ministry and pomp and wealth and trade and place and pride and hopes and fears shall fade when silent as their graves forsaken gloom kings justly buried shall no life resume then shall immortal triumph swell the name that fought for glory or that thought for fame then even the obscurer sons of future praise whose heads wore diadems or genius bays risen from oppressions wound or wants restraint from foes too furious or from friends too faint in second life past fortunes guilt atone and one age lost claim all the rest their own bright in distinguished orbs of wit and war mark histrys measured heaven from star to star here pause  and sigh one pain supremely thine thou great transmitter of a marlbros line  while nobly negligent of caesars care no selfshown comments conscious skill declare greatly
