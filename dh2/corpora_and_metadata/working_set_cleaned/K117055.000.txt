some observations concerning the plague occasioned by and with some reference to the late ingenious discourse of the learned dr mead concerning pestilential contagion and the methods to prevent it  by a wellwisher to the public  dublin printed by and for george grierson at the two bibles in essexstreet       a short introduction to the following observations the compiler of the ensuing brief collections having met with several particulars in the most approved authors that have wrote upon the subject of the plague which he conceived might afford some agreeable entertainment to the curious and tend to the further illustration of some parts of that excellent discourse whereunto they have a reference and also be of some general advantage in case divine providence should for our sins visit us with that sore distemper does here offer them to the view of the public hoping that the many defects will be excused and forgiven which will be easily discerned in so inaccurate a composure put together in great straits of time by one who pretends to little more than barely to perform the office of an index in pointing at some things which occurred to him in turning over books that he thought worthy of some notice and that his honest intentions will be taken in good part by all candid ingenuous readers and that such as have greater abilities and opportunities will be excited to apply their thoughts and studies more closely to a subject which seems to challenge their attention in a more than ordinary manner at this time and will oblige the world with the discoveries that they shall make in this part of nature wherein the lives of men are so much concerned  some observations concerning the plague etc as to the original of this direful scourge of mankind called the plague i find the most learned physicians are much divided in their opinions concerning it and those who have searched very far into the secrets of nature do yet ingenuously acknowledge themselves to be very much at a loss about it the great dr sydenham freely and fully confesses his own and his brethrens ignorance in this matter and that not without a smart reflection upon such as pretend to know more than their neighbors in this and other particulars of the same abstruse nature in chap   d page    of his works he thus expresses himself at vero quae qualisque sit illa aeris dispositio a qua morbificus hic apparatus promanat nos pariter ac complura alia circa quae vecors ac arrogans philosophantium turbanugatur plane ignoramus words so severe and so discouraging to any enquiries of this kind that i shall choose to leave them as i find them  i must here indeed freely own that i am much pleased with the piety and ingenuity of the learned and diligent diemerbroeck who after a large recital and examination of the several hypotheses that had been advanced before his time concerning the origin of the plague and after weighing the arguments and reasons brought by their respective patrons for the support of them declares himself wholly dissatisfied with them all in the eight chapter of his first book and the annotations thereon and after all he has recourse to the  of the great hippocrates the father and prince of physicians and endeavors to make it appear that something supernatural or preternatural is to be understood thereby and that that ancient sage though guided only by the light of natural reason intended to signify by that term somewhat sent down from angry heaven as a just punishment for the wickedness of men  but it may not be improper to add something under this head from that great christian philosopher and while he lived illustrious ornament of the royal society mr boil never to be mentioned without a preface of honor this curious and critical but sober and modest enquirer into the powers of nature and operations of second causes in his occasional disquisition concerning the original of the plague wisely chooses the middle way between those who recur wholly to supernatural causes and those who impute all to natural ones in their accounts hereof he observes in his experimental discourse concerning the insalubrity and salubrity of the air page  0 etc that the sacred writings expressly teach that some plagues have been in an extraordinary manner inflicted by god particularly that which in davids time swept away in three days seventy thousand men but he seems to think that it is carrying the matter too far to infer from hence or to affirm positively that all are so i have sometimes suspected says he page    that in the controversy concerning the origin of the plague whether it be natural or supernatural neither of the contending parties is altogether in the right since it is very possible that some pestilences may not break forth without an extraordinary interposition of almighty god provoked by the sins of men and yet other plagues may be produced by a tragical concourse of merely natural causes but we are not to think that by this last expression he meant to exclude the superior agency or superintendency of the first in any case for no man can express a more becoming and awful sense of or an higher reverence for the cause of causes than this great genius does in all his writings and i could heartily wish that he were more generally imitated herein by the virtuosi of the present age and that a more explicit reference to divine providence were to be found in all their researches into nature and i cannot but hope that it would very much contribute hereunto if our modern wits would seriously read and consider that excellent treatise called the christian virtuoso written by this noble author but to return from this i hope not unuseful digression as to mr boyles opinion concerning the rise of ordinary plagues it is in short this he inclines to think that the malignant disposition of the air whereby the plague is propagated if not first produced is imputable to some kind of subterraneal expirations and particularly to arsenical fumes but as to this he is far from being positive or dogmatical what he offers to render this conjecture probable they that please may see in his discourse of the air as to its unhealthfulness or healthfulness already mentioned thus far as to the origin of the plague  what the learned dr mead advances about the beginning of page   of his discourse in these words nor do i think that in this island particularly there is any one instance of a pestilential disease among us of great consequence which we did not receive from other iufected places is perfectly agrecable to the opinion of the celebrated sydenham who observes that to the evil disposition of the air which proceeds according to him from a latent unknown cause there must be joined the reception of some  or infection flowing from some plaguey body and received either immediately by a near approximation to it or else mediately by the means of some fomes transmitted thencefrom into something apt to receive and retain the same and transferred therewith to distant places until by the great number of infected bodies the air receives such a taint or rather is so charged and loaded with poisonous particles as suffices to propagate the contagion to some distance without any other spark to kindle the spreading fire the substance of this may be seen in page    of his works  in page   the doctor briefly mentions that most terrible plague which carried death over the greatest part of the then known world about the middle of the fourteenth century the history of which being very remarkable especially if all the circumstances related by authors of considerable note be true i shall present the reader with a somewhat larger narrative of it as very proper to affect us with a pious awe and fear of the wrath and vengeance of a righteous god and also to give us a melancholy and humbling representation of the horrid degeneracy of humane nature and the desperate obstinacy of irreclaimably wicked men mr boil in page    of the forementioned discourse has given a brief account of this prodigious pestilence from that excellent french historian mousieur de mezeray who as he tells us relates in the life of philip de valois that the plague which happened in france in the year      was so contagious and destructive that scarce a village or even a house escaped uninfected by it he adds that this pestilence began two years before in the kingdom of cathay by a vapor that was most horribly stinking which brake out of the earth like a kind of subterraneal fire and devoured above  00 leagues of that country even to the very trees and stones and infected the air in a wonderful manner from cathay says he it passed into asia and greece thence into africa afterward into europe which it ransacked throughout thus far mr boil from mezeray in whose account the date of the year seems to have been mistaken or      misprinted for      or      for by dr meads and the following account it began in cathay the northern part of china in       besides what i have quoted from mr boil i shall entertain the reader with a more circumstantial relation of this most fearful calamity which i met in kirchers chronology of the most remarkable plagues that are recorded in history annexed to his scrutinium physicomedicum contagiosae luis quae pestis dicitur the substance of what he writes is this that in the poutificate of clement the sixth charles the fourth being emperor there raged a most cruel pestilence the worst that ever was scarcely the third part of mortals being left alive it so prevailed every where that god seemed as if he would destroy all mankind by a general ruin as of old in the universal deluge villanius tells us that it had its first rise in the upper asia and particularly in the kingdom of cathay in the year      from a most filthy smell supposed to proceed from a certain fiery body which either fell from heaven or broke out of the earth and extended its horrible and terrifying bulk to so vast a compass that it consumed every thing that stood in its way animals houses trees etc for the space of fifteen days journey and some most filthy little beasts furnished with feet and tails by this description they seem to have been a sort of neuts or lizards as also worms and a small sort of snakes in a numberless multitude fell at the same time from the air upon the earth the stench and putrefaction whereof infected the whole region a pestilence hence arising invaded the adjacent places and then spread it self to the remoter cities and provinces so that it depopulated all asia afterward it penetrated into egypt greece and italy thence it passed over into france spain and england and at length into germany poland and all the northern parts with the destruction of innumerable persons in the city of florence only villanius says there perished  0000 but st anthony makes them  00000 and although such a dreadful contagion was sent among men by the avenging hand of god for their enormous wickedness yet after so great a calamity those that succeeded and came greedily into the possession of such rich inheritances as the deceased had left grew worse and more wicked than ever many prodigies preceded this plague in asia such as horrible clefts or swallowing gulfs in the earth exhaling a poisonous wind or vapor and other things of the like sort thus far kircher page      n b if that part of the story be fact concerning the worms snakes etc which are said to have fallen from the air it seems to me much more probable that they were hatched from eggs that had been formerly laid on the earth or leaves of plants by animals and insects of that kind the disposition of the air which was filled with the steams of that horrible meteor before mentioned perhaps greatly contributing to their generation or quickening in such vast numbers  this most fearful plague is also taken notice of by many other chronologers alstedius relates that at lubeck it carried off  0000 and that of the barefooted monks in several parts it destroyed so great a number that in the whole their dead amounted to         and the same particular is mentioned by hogelius in his horologium historicum page     who tells us also that at erford there died such multitudes that the burying places in the city being all filled with carcases   000 were laid in eleven caves under the mountain called the red mountain page   0  many other destructive pestilences before and after this are mentioned by historians and several of the later ones particularly described by learned physicians as that at delft in      by forestus that at vicenza by massaria in      that at nimeguen in      by diemerbroeck and the last very terrible one at london in      by hodges which they that please may consult  in page    toward the end the learned author just mentions the opinion of some who have thought that the pestilential contagion or infection is propagated by the means of insects whose eggs may easily be conveyed from place to place and produce the disease when they come to be hatched but he observes withal that this is a supposition grounded upon no manner of observation and that there is no need to have recourse to it as to this hypothesis of poisonous insects giving rise to the plague it has been lately insisted on by mr bradley who in his new and indeed very ingenious and useful improvements of planting and gardening reprinted here has published a letter from mr robert ball containing several curicus observations which seem to him to render it highly probable and in a small tract lately published by mr bradley the title of which is the plague at marseilles considered he has pursued the same conjecture and transcribed the substance of what is to be found in the book and letter already mentioned upon the head of insects  this notion seems to be much akin to that which was advanced by athanasius kircher that famous enquirer into nature sufficiently known to the learned world by his voluminous labors in the former century and he seems to have taken the hint from the noted cardan for in page    of his scrutinium pestis he tells us that cardan relates that in his time who flourished about the middle of the sixteenth age there was a most cruel pestilence at milan arising as he conjectures from an infinite number of little worms of these vermiculi kircher discourses very largely in his treatise of the plague bothbefore and after thenowmentiond quotation from cardan and particularly in page     he speaks of the plague as something which he hadshewn to be animated because of those animalcula which hetakes to be often if not always the seminary thereof concerning which he thus expresses himself sunt autem hi vermiculi pestis propagatores tam exigui tam tenues et subtiles ut omnem sensus captum cludant etc the substance of what he says is this that these little worms which he supposes to be the spreaders if not wholly the breeders of the plague are so exceeding small that they are to the sense and sight imperceptible and undiscernable unless it be by the help of the most exquisite microscopes and for their smalness may be called atoms but they increase so prodigiously that their numbers are beyond compute these vermiculi as they are generated ex putredine out of corruption so they are easily thrust forth by all the pores of the body in which they are together with the sweaty vapors and are carried along with the slightest motion of the air in vast swarms like the motes that may be seen plying to and fro in the sun beams when they shine into a room that is somewhat obscure through a hole these insects he supposes do tenaciously adhere to any thing they meet with and insinuate themselves into the smallest pores of bodies and to render all this more probable he says that he has often found the blood taken from persons laboring under putrid fevers so full of worms within an hour or two after the emission as even astonished him from whence he persuades himself that man may not only after his death but even while alive be plentifully stored with such vile animalcules though the sense cannot discern them and that on this as well as other accounts job speaks as he does chap      i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou art my mother and my sister he goes on to show that this verminose brood which according to his opinion is cast forth in very great quantity both from the living bodies of such as are infected with the plague and from the carcases of the dead when they begin to putrify being received into the innermost parts of linen and woolen clothes and the like are there cherished and therewith conveyed to distant places and that this is the first and principal seminary of the whole contagion as he endeavors to show more at large but such as desire further information as to this particular must have recourse to the book it self for it would require much more time and room than can be allowed at present but to make an abridgement of his copious discourse about it in several parts of the said treatise this hypothesis must be acknowledged very plausible and ingenious if it be built upon a solid foundation and if such vermiculi as these have a real existence in rerum natura and be not the creatures of astrong imagination only that there are worms very often found in humane bodies is indeed sufficiently evident and what none are ignorant of and that worms have been sometimes vomited up by persons sick of the plague is attested by authors of good credit diemerbroeck mentions one instance of this kind hist    page  0  where he relates this particular concerning a patient of his that he cast up by vomit above  0 small worms as red as blood soon after which he died but he adds that he never saw the like in any other person we are also told that multitudes of such worms were found in some dead bodies that were opened at marseilles which lived and moved very briskly when put into wine or brandy but were soon killed with oil and juice of lemons yet after all kirchers vermiculi and mr balls and mr bradleys insects do not seem to be of the same species with these worms for the former are represented as so many animated atoms scarcely discoverable by the help of the best glasses whereas the latter were sufficiently obvious both to the sight and touch for my part i shall not go about to determine any thing in this matter but shall leave it to the nicer examination of the most learned philosophers and physicians who are capable of penetrating much farther into the mysteries of nature than i can pretend to be only i cannot forbear adding that i do very much doubt while these insects which by the way cannot be the same with mr bradleys blighting insects for then we should have a plague every time we have a blight which in and about this place is almost as often as we have a spring as the gardeners know to their sorrow by the so frequent destruction of their fruit i say i do much doubt while these insects remain in such an invisible state the hypothesis that is founded upon them will also remain precarious and as little demonstrable as others that have been formerly proposed to which i shall subjoin this one remark more that the generation of worms or any other animals ex putredine which kircher seems to take for granted is now almost universally exploded and no such thing as spontaneous or aequivocal generation allowed to the meanest insect but it is agreed among the learned that the smallest creatures do as well as the greatest proceed ex semine and have parents of their own kind by whom they are propagated and this indeed is what mr bradley no where denies and i do not say but that his hypothesis may be consistent with the univocal as well as aequivocal generation of such animalcula yet give me leave to observe once more that the gradual progress which the pestilence usually makes does not seem very well to agree with the exceeding lightness of these volatile insects and upon considering this circumstance one would be inclined to imagine that whatever is the fomes of the contagion it must be something more ponderous though no less poisonous than these venomous insects are supposed to be and i cannot well conceive how it would be possible by all the care or precaution in the world to prevent the spreading of the distemper from one end of a country to the other in a very short space of time if it be carried about by these nimble lightheeld living atoms who would make nothing of flying over lines and rivers or fastening upon the men themselves that stand to guard the passes and in short must go which way soever they are carried by every puff of wind or stream of air but i shall not insist further at present upon this or any other difficulties that occur to my thoughts with reference to this hypothesis i shall leave these little creatures to shift for themselves as well as they can but if they be such plaguey ones as they are represented i desire to have no experimental acquaintance with them though i own that the notion and speculation of them may be agreeable enough to an inquisitive genius and the objections which lie cross in my mind against this hypothesis of plagueproducing insects may possibly be answered to satisfaction by the patrons of it how insoluble soever they may at present appear to me  what the learned doctor suggests in page       etc against the old but unhappy custom of shutting up infected houses is so humane and charitable and supported with such solid reasons that i cannot but hope it will be so far attended to by our wise legislators in all future regulations they shall see fit to make that such a cruel and hurtful method may be effectually prevented and that if at any time it should please god to visit us with that sore distemper the terror and danger of it shall not be augmented by treating the miserable sufferers with such unreasonable rigor as manifestly tends to sink and overwhelm their spirits which ought to be kept up as much as possible as in other diseases so more especially in this and to dispose them for nothing humanely speaking but to despair and die and i cannot doubt but that such timely provision will be made by the public of convenient lazarettoes for the reception of the sick upon the first breaking sorth of the dire disease in any large city or town as may through the blessing of heaven prove an happy means of stopping the progress thereof in its beginning  as to the alternative which the doctor proposes in the close of his excellent performance concerning infected goods that if they be not burned they may be buried deep in the ground i cannot but think the latter of these methods or the sinking them in the sea or in some deep water where it can be conveniently done to prevent digging up to be much the more eligible and the safest as well as least offensive manner of destroying them for i have a vehement suspicion that by the burning of infected clothes and the like the venomous effluvia or poisonous particles adhering to them may be carried along with the smoke and the fatal  or fomes being volatilized by the fire may fill all the circumambient air and instead of restraining may greatly propagate the contagion this i very well remember that in some parts of england it is a generally received opinion that the burning of clothes taken from a person that dies of a very malignant small pox greatly tends to spread the distemper and wicked nurses who desire to make work for themselves are said to practice this very method to accomplish their barbarous designs and when i lived in the county of suffolk i was informed that when that disease was in the town of ipswich about    or  0 years ago a certain barbarous nurse did early in a morning that she might not be known at the head of one of the principal streets put fire to an heap of old rags and bed clothes that had belonged to some poor people who died of that distemper and the smoke driving along the street several that passed by betimes complained of a very offensive smell and the next news was that almost all that had not formerly gone through that disease in that whole street were seized with it in a very few days and if this method of burning be so pernicious in the case of the small pox i doubt there is too much ground of fear according to the common way of arguing a minori ad majus that it may prove still more fatal in the case of the plague but this i humbly submit to the consideration of the learned in philosophy and physic  as for proper prophylacticks or preservatives from the plague the doctor has not offered much upon this head and seems to despair of the discovery of any specific of virtue sufficient to fortify nature against the assaults of such a malignant disease after the mention of some general and very useful rules to be observed by way of prevention and just hinting at a few particulars especially the use of wine vinegar in small quantities which with his conserva me domine is said to have been the antidote of the famous sylvius he does in the    page recommend leaving the infected place as the surest preservative which is the same with the counsel that ramazzini gives in his late dissertation concerning the plague at vienna about seven years ago page     of his works where he thus expresses himself vt quod sentio proferam illud unicum perplacet quod vulgo de tribus compositum appellatur i e de celeri fuga a loco infecto de profectione ad longinquas regiones ac tarda reversione quo remedii genere sapientiores quoque medici uti consuevere the sum of which is that to speak his mind freely he thinks the method of prevention prescribed by the old adage mox long tarde cede recede redi to be the best i e to get away soon to go away far and to return back slowly which he says is a remedy that the wisest physicians themselves are wont to make use of upon this occasion but how proper advice soever this may be to those who are in such circumstances as render them capable of following it yet there are alas great numbers to whom this will seem an hard saying as being by them impracticable the lower sort of people poor mechanics and tradesmen that have nothing to live upon but the profit of their mean employments must be forced to stick by the stuff they have no country seats to repair to and few of them have any such friend as will be free to receive them into their houses in the adjacent villages if therefore any thing could be found out that would if not always which indeed is not to be expected yet pretty often prove a defensative against this dreadful enemy it would certainly be a great and most acceptable service to mankind to acquaint the world therewith but as to this i being no physician my self have little to offer but what has occasionally occurred to me in perusing some of the best medical books written by authors of the greatest name and note who have themselves been eminent practitioners and particularly have had courage enough to visit the sick in places where the plague has raged with the greatest violence among these diemerbroeck and hodges are the chief in the class of modern writers the former being physician at nimeguen during the severe pestilence that made such fearful havoc there in the year      and the latter at london in      when near an hundred thousand persons were cut off by this flagellum dei as to diemerbroeck that great judge mr boil says that he prefers his book of the plague to any that he had ever read of that disease page    of his treatise of the air already mentioned and indeed he seems to have communicated his observations to the world with a great deal of ingenuous plainness and fidelity it would take up too much room to transcribe the half of those receipts which he proposes from himself and others by way of prevention in his treatise of this distemper i shall therefore only give my reader the substance of what he sets down in the    chapter of his  d book the title of which is de meo ipsius vivendi modo where he faithfully relates what course he himself took for his own preservation while he attended the sick during that sad time in which the plague raged at nimeguen the sum of what he says i have endeavored to contract as follows he tells us that he avoided as much as he could all vehement perturbations of mind that he lived intrepidly or without fear that it was the same thing to him whether he visited the sick of the plague or of any other distemper and that he as readily served the poor gratis as the rich for a reward he adds that if at any time he found himself somewhat shocked which in that doleful season wherein there was scarce an house in the whole city that escaped the contagion must needs happen now and then in such a case he refreshed his spirits with three or four draughts of wine that being frequently disturbed in the night and much tired in the day with walking up and down from patient to patient he was forced to sleep an hour after dinner when he could best spare the time though he dissuaded others who were under no such necessity from sleeping in the day that as to diet he used meats of the most easy digestion avoiding swines flesh herrings and the like which he had found hurtful to him that his drink was ordinary ale and small white wine of which he sometimes drank to cheerfulness but never to excess that he kept his body open but not too loose only so as to have one or two stools in a day that once or twice in a week at bedtime he swallowed one or two of his antipestilential pills described in chap   the composition of which shall be subjoined to this account that beginning to visit the sick between four and five in the morning he could then take nothing his stomach perfectly loathing both meat drink and medicine so that he was constrained though against his own judgment to go forth fasting and could do no more than after committing himself to god by pious prayers to chew some grains of the lesser cardamom that about six a clock in the morning he took a little treacle or diascordium or eat a little candied orange pill and very frequently three or four bits of candied elecampane about eight he breakfasted upon a piece of bread with butter and greencheese made of sheeps milk drinking a glass of ale and now and then but not daily he took a draught of wormwood wine about nine at ten he smoaked a pipe of tobacco and after dinner two or three and the like after supper and sometimes two or three more between meals and if at any time he found himself affected with the ill smell of the sick he presently had recourse to the same remedy which he says he found by his own experience as well as always thought to be the most effectual preservative so that the tobacco be of the best sort he adds that upon the ceasing of the plague he left off smoking not willing to accustom himself to it lest he should turn its laudable use into a detestable abuse  the composition of the antipestilential pills is as follows  take the roots of butterbur carline thistle dittany angelica elecampane of each anounce and half of gentian one dram and half of the best rhubarb one ounce and half of zedoary one dram of the whitest agarick half an ounce take also the herbs scordium the lesser centory rue of each half an ounce carduus benedictus six drams and of the flowers of staechas one dram and an half as also the seeds of citron and oranges of each one dram of all these make a gross powder which steep for two or three days in two pounds and an half or three pounds of white wine then boil it for about a quarter of an hour and strain it very strongly in a press and afterward strain itagain through thin paper in the strained liquor dissolve three ounces and an half of the best aloes and three drams and an half of clear myrrh in drops let the moisture evaporate in a china dish till a mass of pills can be made of the remainder these pills says the author we have found to be of great use in time of the plague  thus far from the accurate diemerbroeck who has also given us no less than   0 histories of so many particular persons afflicted with the plague in whose cases may be seen all the various symptoms of that sore distemper with the remedies proper to each of them which are well worth the perusal of such as understand the language wherein they are writ  proceed we now to the learned dr hodges who by the appointment of the government continued in london during that most dreadful pestilence which raged there in the year      of which he afterward published an historical narration with the title of  or an account of the plague in which he treats concerning the rise and progress the causes signs and cure of the contagion and also relates his own manner of living in that time of danger what i shall observe from him shall be only the few particular directions which he gives concerning such things as he judges proper to be done by way of precaution omitting the general ones relating to the timely providing lazarettos keeping houses and streets clean and the like which dr mead has perfectly well recommended as to particular preservatives from the plague dr hodges gives us several receipts of which i shall only set down two that are of easy preparation and perhaps of equal virtue with the more pompous forms the first is what he calls an electuary for the use of the poor the composition of which is in page     of his book viz take conserve of wood sorrel and goats rue of each half a pound of marigolds one pound londontreacle three ounces bole armoniack vitriolated four ounces with syrup of lemons as much as is sufficient make an electuary two or three drams of which may be taken morning and evening the other is an haustus said to be of great virtue viz take water of red roses camphorated two ounces the best vinegar one ounce in which dissolve two scruples of the best bole armoniack add three drams of simple syrup of scabious mix them for a draught  i do the rather mention this because the use of vinegar seems to be much approved by the learned dr mead diemerbroeck also highly commends vinegar and says that he had seen many poor people better preserved by taking a spoonful thereof every morning than some others were by the most costly remedies page   0  among other antidotes against the pestilential contagion dr hodges does particularly commend canary of the best sort of which he frequently drank while he attended the sick and found it of singular use to himself and others his time of drinking it was at dinner and a little before bedtime but as to the smoking of tobacco which diemerbroeck so much extols he speaks very doubtfully of it and seems to have had an aversion to it and to suspect that the pestiferous vapors may be sucked in with the smoke and in fine he prefers his good spanish wine very much before it and this so far as appears was the antidote he chiefly trusted to among the internal ones but then as to external defensatives against this deadly enemy rejecting the many amulets vulgarly prescribed the most of which he thinks to be useless and some noxious there is one which he greatly commends as the most powerful and effectual of all others in this case and that is the having of large issues for instance one in the left arm and the other in the right leg capacious enough to contain five or six pease the more to enforce this advice he does solemnly affirm page   0 that as often as he went into places that were more than ordinarily infected he found that part of his arm in which the issue was exceedingly pained and that thin undigested bloody matter would flow from it with a very smart pungency and that upon this warning given him he presently had recourse to proper alexipharmicks it seems plain from hence even to sense and ocular demonstration that the virus the venom and poison of the contagion did work off in a great measure by means of this sort of evacuation i shall only add under this head that diemerbroeck does also much commend this remedy and observes that many who had issues escaped the plague at nimeguen and of those that had it a considerable number recovered speedily upon taking a sweating medicine and he mentions several other eminent physicians that had found the happy effect of such issues in the course of their practice page   0 etc he observes also that many of those that had sores about them escaped the plague and he tells us that galen of old made the same observation  i shall now in the close of this collection just mention one or two preservatives recorded by the excellent mr boil toward the latter end of his discourse of the air beforementioned the former of these is in page    which was communicated to him by one whom he calls an ancient and very experienced physician to whose care a great pesthouse was committed this person owned to mr boil that besides ardent prayers to god and a very regular diet his constant antidote was only to take every morning fasting a little sea salt dissolved in a few spoonfuls of fair water mr boil adds that he thinks it desirable that notice be taken of all remedies that have been found by good trials available against the plague for since pestilences are various in their kinds it is very possible that their appropriated remedies may be so too and that medicine may prove successful in one which has proved ineffectual in another the noble author adds to this that the said consideration forbad him to pass by the following particular viz that a very learned physician having recommended to him the herb called galega or goatsrue at that time little noted in england as a most effectual antidote against the plague he caused it to be cultivated in a garden and when the pestilence raged most having some of it by him made up with a little sugar in the form of a fine green conserve he sent it to two infected persons who by the divine blessing on it both of them recovered he also takes notice of the great virtue of this herb against the bitings of venomous creatures it may be eaten in its entire substance as a salad or the conserve or syrup may be taken or the juice newly expressed which he thinks better than the syrup or conserve  thus i have finished what i had to offer to the public concerning the plague and the most proper antidotes against it which i have met with in my little reading i shall only add that after all our principaltrust and confidence must be in the goodness and mercy of almighty god through the merits of our lord and savior jesus christ and it greatly concerns all persons to search and try their ways and turn unto the lord with their whole hearts let the means and instruments or second causes of this terrible calamity be what they will whether it owes its origin to subterraneal steams and the expirations of noxious minerals as mr boil conjectures or to a pestiferous aura proceeding from a peculiar and in a sort corruptive alteration of the nitroaereal spirit as dr hodges thinks or to prodigious swarms of invisible venomous insects as kircher and mr bradley imagine or lastly to an unhealthy constitution of the season and disorder in the air occasioned by excessive heat and moisture as galen taught of old which evil constitution is heightened and rendered more malignant by the stinks of stagnating waters by putrid exhalations from the earth and from dead carcases lying unburied which fill the air with contagious particles and so being sucked in with the breath taint in their passage the salival juices which being swallowed down into the stomach fix the malignity there as the learned dr mead observes page   and    of his discourse i say whether this dreadful disease owes its origin to any one or which is more probable to a concurrence and complication of secondary causes yet still it becomes us to look higher and to reverence divine providence as the first and principal cause the great god has said amos    shall there be evil in a city and the lord has not done it sword and famine and pestilence are what he expressly calls his sore judgments  ezekiel      the earth the water the fire the air all the elements and all their actions are at his beck and under his steady government and it is not improbable that he does employ angels as the ministers of his justice to inslict deserved punishments and particularly this of pestilence upon a guilty people possibly he may by their invisible hands scatter through the air those fatal miasmata those malignant venomous atoms and poisonous effluvia the seeds of contagious distempers that carry death and destruction all around to which thought some divines have been led by some passages in holy writ that seem in their opinion to look this way be this as it will it is certain that the almighty is the principal agent who orders and overrules all inferior ones and therefore whatever or whoever be the instruments it is with him that we have chiefly to do it is from him that we have more to fear or hope than from all the world besides and therefore it must needs be both our duty and our interest to fly to his mercyseat to humble our selves before him and to make our earnest supplication to him either to preserve us from such public desolating calamities or to prepare us for them and a general humiliation repentance and reformation is one of the most hopeful means of preservation from this terrible distemper whereby the wrath of an offended god is revealed from heaven against the unrighteousness and ungodliness of a guilty world yea if god should see fit to send it among us such repentance and amendment joined with a true faith in the mediator would best prepare us for it give us the greatest courage and comfort under it and the most happy issue out of it and even death it self would be to us no other than a passage to a better life  for the direction of the curious reader that desires to consult the authors themselves which i have used

distemper by the most eminent physicians of the two last ages such as forestus fabritius hildanus rodericus a fonseca felix platerus joannes crato gregorius horstius raymundus mindererus helmontius mercurialis kircher diemerbroeck hodges and others or they may have recourse to etmullerus and the collections of the voluminous manget in his bibliotheca medicopractica in four large folios his collections relating to the plague may be found in the fourth volume printed at geneva school who to the authors already mentioned has added some later ones as barbette sylvius willis etc  add to the preservatives that garden rue eaten with bread and butter or made up into a conserve is much commended against the plague and if this were added to the conserve prescribed in page    i should think it would be to the advantage thereof the very smell of this herb though ungrateful is said to be an antidote  candied elecampane roots are also much praised by diemerbroeck  to what is observed in the fourth page from dr mead and sydenham concerning the plagues not springing up of its self in this part of the world i shall beg leave to add as a close to this paper that although it may be true that this distemper never breaks out in these countries unless the seminary of it be brought to them from some infected place yet the disposition of the air may sometimes be such as to render it more apt than ordinary to receive into it the poisonous fomes and to propagate the same which is what these learned gentlemen do expressly acknowledge the use which i would make of this reflection is that the warm constitution of the air which has prevailed for the greatest part of the present winter and is generally thought to be too favorable to the seeds of this disease whatever they are should put us upon doubling our diligence in the use of all proper means to guard against the admission of any thing from abroad that may give the least suspicion of its harboring such a fatal mischief for should any thing of this kind be conveyed to us it may have the like unhappy effects with a little spark falling into a great deal of dry tinder that may quickly diffuse it self and break forth into a flame not easy to be extinguished  in magnis voluisse sat est  finis n b in dublin there is published a second edition of dr meads discourse concerning pestilential contagion
