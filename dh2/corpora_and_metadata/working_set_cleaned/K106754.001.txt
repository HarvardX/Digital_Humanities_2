a simple story in four volumes  by mrs inchbald  vol i  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternoster row  m dcc xci  preface it is said a book should be read with the same spirit with which it has been written in that case fatal must be the reception of this  for the writer frankly avows that during the time she has been writing it she has suffered every quality and degree of weariness and lassitude into which no other employment could have betrayed her  it has been the destiny of the writer of this story to be occupied throughout her life in what has the least suited either her inclination or capacity  with an invincible impediment in her speech it was her lot for thirteen years to gain a subsistence by public speaking  and with the utmost detestation to the fatigue of inventing a constitution suffering under a sedentary life and an education confined to the narrow boundaries prescribed her sex it has been her fate to devote a tedious seven years to the unremitting labor of literary productions  whilst a taste for authors of the first rank has been an additional punishment forbidding her one moment of those selfapproving reflections which are assuredly due to the industrious  but alas in the exercise of the arts industry scarce bears the name of merit  what then is to be substituted in the place of genius good fortune  and if these volumes should be attended by the good fortune that has accompanied her other writings to that divinity and that alone she shall attribute their success  yet there is a first cause still to whom i cannot here forbear to mention my obligations  the muses i trust will pardon me that to them i do not feel myself obliged  for in justice to their heavenly inspirations i believe they have never yet favored me with one visitation but sent in their disguise necessity who being the mother of invention gave me all mine  while fortune kindly smiled and was accessory to the cheat  but this important secret i long wished and endeavored to conceal yet one unlucky moment heartily though unwittingly divulged it  i frankly owned that fortune having chased away necessity there remained no other incitement to stimulate me to a labor i abhorred  it happened to be in the power of the person to whom i confided this secret to send necessity once more  once more then bowing to its empire i submit to the task it enjoins  this case has something similar to a theatrical anecdote told i think by colly cibber  a performer of a very mean salary played the apothecary in romeo and juliet so exactly to the satisfaction of the audience that this little part independent of the other characters drew immense houses whenever the play was performed  the manager in consequence thought it but justice to advance the actors salary on which the poor man who like the character he represented had been half starved before began to live so comfortably he became too plump for the part and being of no importance in any thing else the manager of course now wholly discharged him  and thus actually reducing him to the want of a piece of bread in a short time he became a proper figure for the part again welcome then thou allpowerful principle necessity  thou who art the instigator of so many bad authors and actors  but to their shame not of all  thou who from my infancy seldom have forsaken me still abide with me  i will not complain of any hardship thy commands require so thou do not urge my pen to prostitution  in all thy rigor oh do not force my toil to libels  or what is equally pernicious  panegyric on the unworthy  a simple story chapter i dorriforth bred at st omers in all the scholastic rigor of that college was by education and the solemn vows of his order a roman catholic priest  but nicely discriminating between the philosophical and the superstitious part of that character and adopting the former only he possessed qualities not unworthy the first professors of christianity  every virtue which it was his vocation to preach it was his care to practice nor was he in the class of those of the religious who by secluding themselves from the world fly the merit they might have in reforming mankind he refused to shelter himself from the temptations of the layman by the walls of a cloister but sought for and found that shelter in the center of london where he dwelt in his own prudence justice fortitude and temperance  he was about thirty and had lived in the metropolis near five years when a gentleman above his own age but with whom he had from his youth contracted a most sincere friendship died and left him the sole guardian of his daughter a young lady of eighteen  the deceased mr milner on his approaching dissolution perfectly sensible of his state thus reasoned to himself before he made the nomination i have formed no intimate friendship during my whole life except one  i can be said to know the heart of no man except the heart of dorriforth  after knowing his i never sought acquaintance with another  i did not wish to lessen the exalted estimation of human nature he had inspired in this moment of trembling apprehension from every thought that darts across my mind much more for every action which soon i must be called to answer for all worldly views here thrown aside i act as if that tribunal before which i every moment expect to appear were now sitting in judgment upon my purpose  the care of an only child is the great charge that in this tremendous crisis i have to execute  these earthly affections that bind me to her by custom sympathy or what i fondly call parental love would direct me to study her present happiness and leave her to the care of some of those she styles her dearest friends but they are friends only in the sunshine of fortune in the cold nipping frost of disappointment sickness or connubial strife they will forsake the house of care although the house which they themselves may have built  here the excruciating anguish of the father overcame that of the dying man  in the moment of desertion continued he which i now picture to myself where will my child find comfort  that heavenly aid religion gives which now amidst these agonizing tortures chears with the bright ray of consolation my frightened soul that she will be denied  it is in this place proper to remark that mr milner was a member of the church of rome but on his marriage with a lady of protestant tenets they mutually agreed their sons should be educated in the religious opinion of their father and their daughters in that of their mother one child only was the result of their union the child whose future welfare now occupied the thoughts of her expiring father  from him the care of her education had been withheld as he kept inviolate the promise made to her departed mother on the article of religion and therefore consigned his daughter to a protestant boardingschool from whence she was sent with merely such sentiments of religion as young ladies of fashion mostly imbibe her little heart employed in all the endless pursuits of personal accomplishments had left her mind without one ornament except those which nature gave and even they were not wholly preserved from the ravages made by its rival art  while her father was in health he beheld with the extreme of delight his accomplished daughter without one fault with which taste or elegance could have reproached her nor ever enquired what might be her other failings  cast on a bed of sickness and upon the point of leaving her to her future fate those failings at once rushed on his memory  and all the pride the fond enjoyment he had taken in beholding her open the ball or delight her hearers with her sprightly wit escaped his remembrance or not escaping were thought of with a sigh of contrition or at best a contemptuous frown at the frivolous qualification  something more essential said he to himself must be considered  something to prepare her for an hour like this i now experience  can i then leave her to the charge of those who themselves never remember such an hour will come  dorriforth is the only person i know who uniting every moral virtue to those of religion and native honor to pious faith will protect without controuling instruct without tyrannizing comfort without flattering and perhaps in time make good by choice rather than by constraint the dear object of his dying friends sole care  dorriforth who came post from london to visit mr milner in his illness received a few moments before his death all his injunctions and promised to fulfill them  but in this last token of mr milners perfect esteem of his friend he still restrained him from all authority to direct his ward in one religious opinion contrary to those her mother had professed and in which she herself had been educated  never perplex her mind with an idea that may disturb but cannot reform  were his latest words and dorriforths reply gave him entire satisfaction  miss milner was not with her father at this affecting period  some delicately nervous friend with whom she was on a visit at bath thought proper to conceal from her not only the danger of his death but even his indisposition lest it might alarm a mind she thought too susceptible this refined tenderness gave poor miss milner the almost insupportable agony of hearing her father was no more even before she was told he was not in health in the bitterest anguish she flew to pay her last duty to his remains and performed it with the truest filial love while dorriforth upon important business was obliged to return to town  chapter ii dorriforth returned to london heavily afflicted for the loss of his friend and yet perhaps with his thoughts more engaged upon the trust that friend had reposed in him he knew the life miss milner had been accustomed to lead he dreaded the repulses his admonitions might possibly meet from her and feared he had undertaken a task he was too weak to execute  the protection of a young woman of fashion  mr dorriforth was nearly related to one of our first catholic peers his income was by no means confined but approaching to affluence yet his attention to those in poverty and the moderation of his own desires were such that he lived in all the careful plainness of economy  his habitation was in the house of a mrs horton an elderly lady who had a maiden niece residing with her not many years younger than herself  but although miss woodley was thirty and in person exceedingly plain yet she possessed such an extreme cheerfulness of temper and such an inexhaustible fund of good nature that she escaped not only the ridicule but even the appellation of an old maid  in this house dorriforth had lived before the death of mr horton nor upon that event did he think it necessary notwithstanding his religious vow of celibacy to sly the roof of two such unseductive innocent females as mrs horton and her niece  on their part they regarded him with all that respect and reverence the most religious slock regards its pastor and his friendly society they not only esteemed a spiritual but a temporal advantage as the liberal stipend he allowed for his apartments and board enabled them to continue in the large and commodious house where they had resided during the life of mr horton  here upon mr dorriforths return from his journey preparations were made for the reception of his ward her father having made it one of his requests that she might for a time at least dwell in the same house with her guardian receive the same visits and cultivate the acquaintance of his acquaintances and friends  when the will of her father was made known to miss milner she submitted without the smallest reluctance to all he had required  her mind at that time impressed with the most poignant sorrow for his loss made no distinction of happiness that was to come and the day was appointed with her silent acquiescence when she was to arrive in london and take up her abode at mrs hortons with all the retinue of a rich heiress  mrs horton was delighted with the addition this acquisition to her family was likely to make to her annual income and to the style of her living  the goodnatured miss woodley was overjoyed at the expectation of their new guest yet she herself could not tell why  but the reason was her kind heart wanted more ample field for its benevolence and now her thoughts were all pleasingly employed how she should render not only the lady herself but even all her attendants happy in their new situation  the thoughts of dorriforth were less agreeably engaged  cares doubts fears possessed his mind  so forcibly possessed it that upon every occasion which offered he would inquisitively try to gain intelligence of his wards disposition before he saw her for he was as yet a stranger not only to the real propensities of her mind but even to her person a constant round of visits having prevented his meeting her at her fathers the very few times he had been at his house since her return from boardingschool the first person whose opinion he with all proper reserve asked concerning miss milner was lady evans the widow of a baronet who frequently visited at mrs hortons  but that the reader may be interested in what dorriforth says and does it is necessary to give some description of his person and manners his figure was tall and elegant but his face except a pair of dark bright eyes a set of white teeth and a graceful fall in his clerical curls of dark brown hair had not one feature to excite admiration  he possessed notwithstanding such a gleam of sensibility diffused over each that many people mistook his face for handsome and all were more or less attracted by it  in a word the charm that is here meant to be described is a countenance  on his countenance you beheld the feelings of his heart  saw all its inmost workings  the quick pulses that beat with hope and fear or the placid ones that were stationary with patient resignation on this countenance his thoughts were pictured and as his mind was enriched with every virtue that could make it valuable so was his honest face adorned with every emblem of those virtues  and they not only gave a luster to his aspect but added a harmonious sound to all he uttered it was persuasive it was perfect eloquence whilst in his looks you behold his thoughts moving with his lips and ever coinciding with what he said  with one of those interesting looks which revealed the anxiety of his heart and with that graceful restraint of all gesticulation for which he was remarkable even in his most anxious concerns he addressed lady evans who had called on mrs horton to hear and to tell the news of the day your ladyship was at bath last spring  you know the young lady to whom i have the honor of being appointed guardian  pray   he was earnestly intent upon asking a question but was prevented by her ladyship  dear mr dorriforth do not ask me any thing about the lady  when i saw her she was very young though indeed that is but three months ago and she cannot be much older now  she is eighteen answered dorriforth coloring with regret at the doubts her ladyship had increased but not inspired  and she is very beautiful that i can assure you replied her ladyship  which i call no qualification said dorriforth rising from his seat in evident uneasiness  but where there is nothing else returned lady evans let me tell you beauty is something  much worse than nothing in my opinion returned dorriforth  but now mr dorriforth do not from what i have said frighten yourself and imagine the young lady worse than she really is  all i know of her is merely that she is a young idle indiscreet giddy girl with half a dozen lovers in her suite some coxcombs some men of gallantry some single and some married  dorriforth started  for the first time of my life cried he with a manly sorrow i wish i had never known her father  nay said mrs horton who expected every thing to happen just as she wished for neither an excellent education the best company or long experience had been able to cultivate or brighten this good ladys understanding nay said she i am sure mr dorriforth you will soon convert her from all her evil ways  dear me returned lady evans i am sure i never meant to hint at any thing evil  and for what i have said i will give you up my authors if you please for they were not observations of my own all i do is to mention them again  the good natured miss woodley who sat working at the window an humble listener to this discourse ventured on this to say exactly six words then dont mention them any more  let us change the subject said dorriforth  with all my heart cried her ladyship and i am sure it will be to the young ladys advantage  is she tall or short asked mrs horton still wishing for farther information  oh tall enough of all conscience returned lady evans i tell you again there is no fault can be found with her person  but if her mind is defective  exclaimed dorriforth with a sigh     that may be improved as well as the person cried miss woodley  no my dear returned her ladyship i never heard of a pad to make strait an illshapen disposition  o yes lady evans aswered miss woodley good company good books experience and the misfortunes of others may have more power to form the mind to virtue than   her ladyship would not suffer her to go on but rising hastily from her seat cried i must be gone  i have fifty people waiting for me at home  besides were i inclined to hear a sermon i should desire mr dorriforth to preach and not you  just then mrs hillgrave was announced  and here is mrs hillgrave  continued lady evans  i believe mrs hillgrave you know miss milner dont you the young lady who has lately lost her father  mrs hillgrave was the wife of a merchant who had met with some severe losses and as soon as the name of miss milner was uttered she lifted tip her hands and the tears started in her eyes  there cried lady evans i desire you will give your opinion of her and i am sorry i cannot stay to hear it saying this she courtesied and took her leave  when mrs hillgrave had been seated a few minutes mrs horton who loved information equal to the most inquisitive of her sex begged that lady  if she might be permitted to know why at the mention of miss milner she had seemed so much affected  this question interesting the fears of dorriforth he turned anxiously round attentive to the reply  miss milner answered she has been my benefactress and the best i ever had as she spoke she took out her handkerchief and wiped away the tears that ran down her face  how so cried dorriforth eagerly with his eyes moistened with joy nearly as much as here is were with gratitude  my husband at the commencement of his distresses replied mrs hillgrave owed a sum of money to her father and from repeated provocations mr milner was determined to seize upon all our effects  his daughter however procured us time in order to discharge the debt and when she found that time was insufficient and her father no longer to be dissuaded from his intention she secretly sold some of her most valuable ornaments to satisfy his demand and screen us from its consequences  dorriforth pleased at this recital took mrs hillgrave by the hand and told her she should never want a friend  is miss milner tall or short again asked mrs horton fearing from the sudden pause which had ensued the subject should be dropped  i dont know answered mrs hillgrave  is she handsome or ugly  i really cannot tell  it is very strange you should not take notice  i did take notice but i cannot depend upon my own judgment  to me she appeared beautiful as an angel but perhaps i was deceived by the beauties of her disposition  chapter iii this gentlewomans visit inspired mr dorriforth with some confidence in the principles and character of his ward  the day arrived on which she was to leave her late fathers seat to take up her abode at mrs hortons and he accompanied by miss woodley went in his carriage to meet her and waited at an inn on the road for her reception  after many a sigh paid to the memory of her father miss milner upon the tenth of november arrived at the place half way on her journey to town where dorriforth and miss woodley were expecting her  besides attendants she had with her a gentleman and a lady distant relations of her mothers who thought it but a proper testimony of their civility to attend her part of the way but who so much envied her guardian the trust mr milner had reposed in him that as soon as they had delivered her safe into his care they returned  when the carriage which brought miss milner stopped at the inn gate and her name was announced to dorriforth he turned pale  something like a foreboding of disaster trembled at his heart and consequently darted over all his face  miss woodley was even obliged to rouse him from the dejection into which he was cast or he would have sunk beneath it  she was obliged also to be the first to welcome his lovely charge  lovely beyond description  but the sprightly vivacity the natural gaietv which report had given to miss milner were softened by her recent sorrow to a meek sadness  and that haughty display of charms imputed to her manners was changed to a pensive demeanor  the instant dorriforth was introduced to her by miss woodley as her guardian and her deceased fathers most beloved friend she burst into a flood of tears knelt down to him for a moment and promised ever to obey him as her father  he had his handkerchief to his face at the time or she would have beheld the agitation of his heart  the remotest sensations of his soul  this affecting introduction being over and some minutes passed in general conversation the carriages were again ordered and bidding farewell to the friends who had accompanied her miss milner her guardian and miss woodley departed for town the two ladies in miss milners carriage and dorriforth in that in which he came  miss woodley as they rode along made no attempts to ingratiate herself with miss milner though perhaps it might constitute one of her first wishes  she behaved to her but as she constantly behaved to every other creature  that was sufficient to gain the esteem of one possessed of an understanding equal to this young ladys  she had penetration to discover miss woodleys unaffected worth and was soon induced to reward it with the warmest friendship  chapter iv after a nights rest in london less strongly impressed with the loss of her father reconciled if not already attached to her new acquaintance her thoughts pleasingly occupied with the reflection she was in that gay metropolis  a wild rapturous picture of which her active fancy had often formed  miss milner arose from a peaceful and refreshing sleep with much of that vivacity and all those airy charms which for a while had yielded their transcendent power to less potent sadness  beautiful as she had appeared to miss woodley and to dorriforth the preceding day when she joined them the next morning at breakfast repossessed of her lively elegance and dignified simplicity they gazed at her and at each other alternately with wonder  and mrs horton as she sat at the head of her teatable felt herself but as a menial servant such command has beauty if united with sense and with virtue  in miss milner it was so united  yet let not our overscrupulous readers be misled and extend their idea of her virtue so as to magnify it beyond that which frail mortals commonly possess nor must they cavil if on a nearer view they find it less  but let them consider that if miss milner had more faults than generally belong to others she had likewise more temptations  from her infancy she had been indulged in all her wishes to the extreme of folly and habitually started at the unpleasant voice of control  she was beautiful she had been too frequently told the high value of that beauty and thought those moments passed in wasteful idleness during which she was not gaining some new conquest  she had besides a quick sensibility which too frequently discovered itself in the immediate resentment of injury or neglect  she had acquired also the dangerous character of a wit but to which she had no real pretensions although the most discerning critic hearing her converse might fall into this mistake  her replies had all the effect of rerepartee not because she possessed those qualities which can properly be called wit but that what she said was spoken with an energy an instantaneous and powerful perception of what she said joined with a real or wellcounterfeited simplicity a quick turn of the eye and an arch smile of the countenance  her words were but the words of others and like those of others put into common sentences but the delivery made them pass for wit as grace in an ill proportioned figure will often make it pass for symmetry  and now  leaving description  the reader must form a judgment of her by her actions by all the round of great or trivial circumstances that shall be related  at breakfast which was just begun at the beginning of this chapter the conversation was lively on the part of miss milner wise on the part of dorriforth good on the part of miss woodley and an endeavor at all three on the part of mrs horton  the discourse at length drew from mr dorriforth this observation  you have a greater resemblance of your father miss milner than i imagined you had from report i did not expect to find you so like him  nor did i mr dorriforth expect to find you any thing like what you are  no  pray madam what did you expect to find me  i expected to find you an elderly man and a plain man  this was spoken in an artless manner but in a tone which obviously declared she thought her guardian both young and handsome  he replied but not without some little embarrassment a plain man you shall find me in all my actions  she returned then your actions are to contradict your looks  for in what she said miss milner had the quality peculiar to wits to speak the thought that first occurs which thought has generally truth on its side  on this he ventured to pay her a compliment in return  you miss milner i should suppose must be a very bad judge of what is plain and what is not  how so sir  because i am sure you will readily own you do not think yourself handsome and allowing that you instantly want judgment  and i would rather want judgment than beauty she replied and so i give up the one for the other  with a serious face as if proposing a most serious question dorriforth continued and you really believe you are not handsome  i should from my own opinion believe so but in some respects i am like you roman catholics i dont believe from my own understanding but from what other people tell me  and let this be the criterion replied dorriforth that what we teach is truth for you find you would be deceived did you not trust to persons who know better than yourself  but my dear miss milner we will talk upon some other topic and never resume this again  we differ in opinion i dare say on one subject only and this difference i hope will never extend itself to any other  therefore let not religion be named between us for as i have resolved never to persecute you in pity be grateful and do not persecute me  miss milner looked with surprise that any thing so lightly said should be so seriously received  the kind miss woodley ejaculated a short prayer to herself that heaven would forgive her young friend the involuntary sin of ignorance  while mrs horton unperceived as she imagined made the sign of the cross upon her forehead to prevent the infectious taint of heretical opinions this pious ceremony miss milner by chance observed and now showed such an evident propensity to burst into a sit of laughter that the good lady of the house could no longer contain her resentment but exclaimed god forgive you with a severity so far different from the idea the words conveyed that the object of her anger was on this obliged freely to indulge that risibility which she had been struggling to smother and without longer suffering under the agony of restraint she gave way to her humor and laughed with a liberty so uncontrouled that in a short time left her in the room with none but the tenderhearted miss woodley a witness of her folly  my dear miss woodley then cried miss milner after recovering herself i am afraid you will not forgive me  no indeed i will not returned miss woodley  but how unimportant how weak how ineffectual are words in conversation  looks and manners alone express  for miss woodley with her charitable face and mild accents saying she would not forgive implied only forgiveness  while mrs horton with her enraged voice and aspect begging heaven to pardon the offender palpably said she thought her unworthy of all pardon  chapter v six weeks have now elapsed since miss milner has been in london partaking with delight in all its pleasures whilst dorriforth has been sighing with apprehension attending with precaution and praying with the most zealous fervor for her safety  her own and her guardians acquaintance and the new friendships to speak in the unmeaning language of the world which she was continually forming crowded so perpetually to the house that seldom had dorriforth even a moment left from her visits or visitors to warn her of her danger  yet when a moment offered he snatched it eagerly  pressed the necessity of time not always passed in society of reflection of reading of thoughts for a future state and of virtues acquired to make old age supportable  that forcible power of innate feeling which directs the tongue to eloquence had its effect while she listened to him and she sometimes put on the looks and gesture of assent and sometimes even spoke the language of conviction but this the first call of dissipation would change to illtimed raillery or peevish remonstrance at being limited in delights her birth and fortune entitled her to enjoy  among the many visitors who attended at her levees and followed wherever she went was one that seemed even when absent to share her thoughts  this was lord frederick lawnly the son of a duke and the avowed favorite of all the most discerning women of taste  lord frederick was not more than twentythree sprightly elegant extremely handsome and possessed of every accomplishment to captivate a heart less susceptible of love than miss milners was supposed to be  with these allurements no wonder if she took a pleasure in his company  no wonder if she took a pride to have it known he was among the number of her most devoted admirers  dorriforth beheld the growing intimacy with alternate pain and pleasure  he wished to see miss milner married to see his charge in the protection of another rather than of himself yet under the care of a young nobleman immersed in all the vices of the town without one moral excellence but such as might result eventually from the influence of the moment  under such care he trembled for her happiness  yet trembled more lest her heart should be purloined without even the authority of matrimonial views  with these sentiments dorriforth could never disguise his uneasiness at the sight of lord frederick nor could his lordship but discern the suspicion of the guardian and consequently each was embarrassed in the presence of the other  miss milner observed but observed with indifference the sensations of both  there was but one passion which at present held a place in her heart and that was vanity vanity defined into all the species of pride vainglory selfapprobation  an inordinate desire of admiration and an immoderate enjoyment of the art of pleasing for her own individual happiness and not for the happiness of others  still had she a heart inclined and oftentimes affected by tendencies less unworthy but those approaches to what was estimable were generally arrested in their first impulse by some darling folly  miss woodley who could discover virtue although of the most diminitive kind and scarcely through the magnifying glass of calumny could ever perceive a fault was miss milners constant companion and her advocate with dorriforth whenever during her absence she became the subject of discourse  he listened with hope to the praises of her friend but saw with despair how little they were merited  sometimes he struggled to contain his anger but oftener strove to suppress tears of pity for her hapless state  by this time all her acquaintance had given lord frederick to her as a lover the servants whispered it and some of the public prints had even fixed the day of marriage  but as no explanation had taken place on the part of his lordship dorriforths uneasiness was increased and he seriously told his ward he thought it prudent to entreat lord frederick to desist visiting her  she smiled with ridicule at the caution but finding it a second time repeated and in a manner that savoured of authority she promised to make and to enforce the request  the next time his lordship came she did so assuring him it was by her guardians desire who from motives of delicacy had permitted her rather to solicit as a favor what he himself would make as a demand  lord frederick reddened with anger  he loved miss milner but he doubted whether from the frequent proofs he had experienced of his own inconstancy he should continue to love  and this interference of her guardian threatened an explanation or a dismission before he became thoroughly acquainted with his own heart  alarmed confounded and provoked he replied  by heaven i believe mr dorriforth loves you himself and it is jealousy makes him treat me thus  for shame my lord cried miss woodley who was present and trembling with horror at the sacrilegious idea  nay shame for him if he be not in love  answered his lordship for what but a savage could behold beauty like here is and not own its power  habit replied miss milner is every thing  and mr dorriforth sees and converses with beauty and from habit does not fall in love as you my lord merely from habit do  then you believe cried he love is not in my nature  no more of it my lord than habit could very soon extinguish  but i would not have it extinguished  i would rather it should mount to a flame for i think it a crime to be insensible of the blessings love can bestow  then your lordship indulges the passion to avoid a sin  the very motive which deters mr dorriforth  which ought to deter him madam for the sake of his oaths  but monastic vows like those of marriage were made to be broken  and surely when your guardian looks on you his wishes   are never less pure returned miss milner eagerly than those which dwell in the bosom of my celestial guardian  at that instant dorriforth entered the room the color had mounted into miss milners face from the warmth with which she had delivered her opinion and his entering at the very moment this compliment had been paid in his absence heightened the blush to a deep glow on every feature and a confusion that trembled on her lips and shook through all her frame  what is the matter cried dorriforth looking with concern on her discomposure  a compliment paid by herself to you sir replied his lordship has thus affected the lady  as if she blushed at the untruth said dorriforth  nay that is unkind cried miss woodley for if you had been here     i would not have said what i did replied miss milner but left him to vindicate himself  is it possible i can want vindication returned dorriforth who would think it worth their while to slander so unimportant a person as i am  the man who has the charge of miss milner replied lord frederick derives a consequence from her  no ill consequence i hope my lord replied dorriforth with a firmness in his voice and an eye fixed so steadfastly that his lordship hesitated for a moment in want of a reply  and miss milner softly whispering to him as her guardian turned his head to avoid an argument he bowed acquiescence  and then as incompliment to her he wished to change the subject with a smile of ridicule he cried  i wish mr dorriforth you would give me absolution of all my sins for i confess they are many and manifold  hold my lord exclaimed dorriforth do not confess before the ladies lest in order to excite their compassion you should be tempted to accuse yourself of sins you have never yet committed  at this miss milner laughed seemingly so well pleased that lord frederick with a sarcastic sneer repeated from abelard it came and heloisa still must love the name whether from an inattention to the quotation or from a consciousness it was wholly inapplicable dorriforth heard it without one emotion of shame or of anger  while miss milner seemed shocked at the implication her pleasantry was immediately depressed and she threw open the sash and held her head out at the window to conceal the embarrassment these lines had occasioned  the earl of elmwood was at this juncture announced  a catholic nobleman just come of age and on the eve of marriage  his lordships visit was to his cousin mr dorriforth but as all ceremonious visits were alike received by dorriforth miss milner and mrs hortons family in one common apartment lord elmwood was ushered into this and for the present directed the conversation to a different subject  chapter vi in anxious desire that the affection or acquaintance between lord frederick lawnly and miss milner might be finally broken her guardian received with the highest satisfaction overtures from sir edward ashton in behalf of his passion for that young lady  sir edward was not young or handsome old or ugly but immensely rich and possessed of qualities that made him in every sense worthy the happiness to which he aspired  he was the man dorriforth would have chosen before any other for the husband of his ward and his wishes made him sometimes hope against his reason that sir edward would not be rejected  and he resolved to try the force of his own power in the strongest recommendation of him  notwithstanding that dissimilarity of opinion which in almost every respect subsisted between miss milner and her guardian there was generally the most punctilious observance of good manners from each toward the other  on the part of dorriforth more especially for his politeness would sometimes appear even like the result of a system he had marked out for himself as the only means to keep his ward restrained within the same limitations  whenever he addressed her there was an unusual reserve upon his countenance and more than usual gentleness in his tone of voice which seemed the effect of sentiments her birth and situation inspired joined to a studied mode of respect best suited to enforce the same from her  the wishedfor consequence was produced  for though there was an instinctive rectitude in the understanding of miss milner that would have taught her without other instruction what manners to observe toward her deputed father yet from some volatile thought or some quick sense of feeling she had not been accustomed to subdue she was perpetually on the verge of treating him with levity but he would immediately recall her recollection by a reserve too awful and a gentleness too sacred for her to violate the distinction which both required was thus by his skilful management alone preserved  one morning he took an opportunity before her and miss woodley to introduce and press the subject of sir edward ashtons hopes he first spoke warmly in his praise then plainly told miss milner he believed she possessed the power to make so deserving a man happy to the summit of his wishes a laugh of ridicule was the only answer  but a sudden and expressive frown from dorriforth having quickly put an end to it he resumed his wonted politeness and said  i wish miss milner you would show more good taste than thus pointedly to disapprove of sir edward  how mr dorriforth replied she can you expect me to give proofs of a good taste when sir edward whom you consider with such high esteem has given so bad an example of his in approving of me  dorriforth wished not to flatter her frailty by a compliment she seemed to have sought for and for a moment hesitated what to say  answer sir that question she cried  why then madam replied he it is my opinion that supposing what your humility has advanced to be just yet sir edward will not suffer by the suggestion for in cases where the heart is so immediately concerned as i believe sir edwards to be good taste or rather reason has not proper power to act  you are right mr dorriforth this is a thorough justification of sir edward  and when i fall in love i must beg you will make the same excuse for me  then returned he earnestly before your heart is in that state i have described exert your reason  i shall answered she and not consent to marry a man whom i could never love  unless your heart is already given away miss milner what can make you speak with such a degree of certainty  he thought on lord frederick while he said this and he fixed his eyes upon her as if he wished to penetrate her sentiments and yet trembled for what he might find there  she blushed and her looks would have confirmed her guilty had not a free and unembarrassed tone of voice more than her words preserved her from that sentence  no she replied my heart is not given away and yet i can venture to declare sir edward will never possess an atom of it  i am sorry for both your sakes these are your sentiments  he replied but as your heart is still your own and he seemed rejoiced to find it was permit me to warn you how you part with a thing so precious  the dangers the sorrows you hazard in bestowing it are greater than you may be aware of the heart once gone our thoughts our actions are no more our own than that is  he seemed forcing himself to utter all this and yet to break off as if he could have said much more had not the extreme delicacy of the subject prevented him  when he left the room and miss milner heard the door shut after him she said with a thoughful and inquisitive earnestness what can make good people so skilled in all the weaknesses of the bad mr dorriforth with all those prudent admonitions appears rather like a man who has passed his life in the gay world experienced all its dangerous allurements all its repentant sorrows than like one who has lived his whole time secluded in a monastry or his own study  then he speaks with such exquisite sensibility on the subject of love he commends the very thing he would decry  i do not think my lord frederick could make the passion appear in more pleasing colors by painting its delights than mr dorriforth can in describing its sorrows  and if he talks to me frequently in this manner i shall certainly take pity on his lordship for the sake of his enemies eloquence  miss woodley who heard the conclusion of this speech with the tenderest concern cried alas you then think seriously of lord frederick  suppose i do wherefore that alas miss woodley  because i fear you will never be happy with him  that is plainly telling me he will not be happy with me  i cannot speak of marriage from experience answered miss woodley but i think i can guess what it is  nor can i speak of love from experience replied miss milner but i think i can guess what it is  but do not fall in love my dear miss milner cried miss woodley with an earnestness as if she had been asking a favor that depended upon the will of the person entreated do not fall in love without the approbation of your guardian  her young friend laughed at the inefficacious prayer but promised to do all she could to oblige her  chapter vii sir edward not wholly discouraged by the denial with which dorriforth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kinder reception and was so frequently in the house of mrs horton that lord fredericks jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection he now every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though less frequently than before pleaded his cause so ardently that miss woodley who was occasionally present and ever compassionate could scarce resist wishing him success he now unequivocally offered marriage and entreated to be suffered to lay his proposals before mr dorriforth but this miss milner positively forbid  her reluctance he imputed however more to the known partiality of her guardian to the addresses of sir edward than to any motive which depended upon herself and to mr dorriforth his lordship conceived a greater dislike than ever believing that through his interposition in spite of his wards attachment he might yet be deprived of her  but miss milner declared both to him and to her friend love had at present gained no one influence over her mind  yet did the watchful miss woodley oftentimes hear a sigh burst forth unknowing to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush of shame would instantly spread over her face  this seeming struggle with her passion endeared her more than ever to miss woodley and she would even risk the displeasure of dorriforth by her ready compliance in every new pursuit that might amuse the time she else saw passed by her friend in heaviness of heart  balls plays incessant company at length rouzed her guardian from that mildness with which he had been accustomed to treat her  night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her safety while abroad morning after morning it had been broken by the clamor of her return  he therefore said to her one forenoon as he met her accidentally upon the stair case  i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home  unprepared for the sudden question she blushed and replied yes while she knew she was engaged to a brilliant assembly for which she had been a whole week consulting her milliner in preparation  she however flattered herself what she had said to mr dorriforth might be excused as a slight mistake the lapse of memory or some other trifling fault when he should know the truth  the truth was earlier divulged than she expected  for just as dinner was removed her footman delivered a message to her from her milliner concerning a new dress for the evening  the present evening particularly marked  dorriforth looked astonished  i thought miss milner you gave me your word you would pass this evening at home  i mistook then  for i had before given my word i should pass it abroad  indeed cried he  yes indeed returned she and i believe it is right i should keep my first promise is it not  the promise you gave me then you do not think of any consequence  yes certainly if you do  i do  and mean perhaps to make it of much more consequence than it deserves by being offended  whether or not i am offended  you shall find i am and he looked so  she caught his piercing steadfast eye  here is were immediately cast down and she trembled  either with shame or with resentment  mrs horton rose from her seat  moved the decanters and the fruit round the table  stirred the fire  and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered  nor had this good womans officious labors taken the least from the aukwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force  at last miss milner rising with alacrity was preparing to go out of the room when dorriforth raised his voice and in a tone of authority said  miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening  sir  she exclaimed with a kind of doubt of what she had heard  a surprise which fixed her hand on the door she had half opened but which now she showed herself irresolute whether to open wide in defiance or to shut submissive  before she could resolve dorriforth arose from his seat and said with a degree of force and warmth she had never heard him speak with before  i command you to stay at home this evening  and he walked immediately out of the apartment by the opposite door  her hand fell motionless from that she held  she appeared motionless herself for some time  till mrs horton beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received caused a flood of tears to flow and her bosom to heave as if her heart was breaking  miss woodley would have said something to comfort her but she had caught the infection and could not utter a word  not from any real cause of grief did this lady weep but there was a magnetic quality in tears which always drew forth here is  mrs horton secretly enjoyed this scene although the real well meaning of her heart and ease of her conscience did not tell her so  she however declared she had long prognosticated it would come to this and she now only thanked heaven it was no worse  what would you have worse madam cried miss milner am not i disappointed of the ball  you dont mean to go then said mrs horton i commend your prudence and i dare say it is more than your guardian gives you credit for  do you think i would go answered miss milner with an earnestness that for a time suppressed her tears in contradiction to his will  it is not the first time i believe you have acted contrary to that miss milner returned mrs horton and affected a tenderness of voice to soften the harshness of her words  if that is the case madam replied miss milner i see nothing that should prevent me now and she flung out of the room as if she had resolved to disobey him  this alarmed poor miss woodley  dear aunt she cried to mrs horton follow and prevail upon miss milner to give up her design she means to go to the ball in opposition to her guardians will  then cried mrs horton i will not be an instrument in deterring her  if she does it may be for the best it may give mr dorriforth a clearer knowledge what means are proper to use to convert her from evil  but dear madam she must be prevented the evil of disobedience and as you tempted you will be the most likely to dissuade her  but if you will not i must endeavor  miss woodley was leaving the room to perform this good design when mrs horton in humble imitation of the example given her by dorriforth cried  niece i command you not to stir out of this room this evening  miss woodley obediently sat down  and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber with her friend she never showed by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered  at the usual hour mr dorriforth and his ward were summoned to tea  dorriforth entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and although he took up a pamphlet and affected to read it was plain to discern he scarcely knew he held it in his hand  mrs horton began to make tea with a mind as wholly intent upon something else as dorriforths  she was longing for the event of this misunderstanding for to age trivial matters are important and though she wished no ill to miss milner yet with an inclination bent upon seeing something new  without the fatigue of going out of her own house  she was not over scrupulous what that novelty might be  but for fear she should have the imprudence to speak a word upon the subject which employed her thoughts or even look as if she thought of it at all she pinched her lips close together and cast her eyes on vacancy lest their significant regards might detect her  and for fear any noise should intercept even the sound of what might happen she walked across the room more softly than usual and more softly touched every thing she was obliged to lay her hand on  miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the gentle gingle of a teaspoon was like a deeptoned bell all was so quiet  mrs horton too in the selfapproving reflection that she herself was not in any quarrel or altercation of any kind felt at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable  miss woodley did not recollect herself so but was so in reality  in her peace and charity were instinctive virtues accident could not increase them  the first cups of tea were scarcely poured out when a servant came with miss milners compliments and she should drink none  the book shaked in dorriforths hand while this message was delivered  he believed her to be dressing for her evenings entertainment and now studied in what manner to prevent or to resent it  he coughed  drank his tea  endeavored to talk but found it difficult  sometimes read  and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room  not dressed for ball but as she had rose from dinner  dorriforth read on and seemed afraid to look up lest he should behold what he could not have pardoned  she drew a chair and sat down at the table by the side of miss woodley  after a few minutes pause and some small embarrassment on the part of mrs horton at the disappointment she had to contend with from miss milners unexpected obedience she asked that young lady if she would now take tea  to which miss milner replied no i thank you maam in a voice so languid compared to her usual one that dorriforth lifted his eyes from the book and seeing her in the same negligent dress she had worn all the day cast them away again  not with a look of triumph but of confusion  and whatever he might have suffered had he beheld her decorated and on the point of bidding defiance to his commands yet even upon that trial he had not endured half the painful sensations he now for a moment felt  he felt himself to blame  he feared he had treated her with too much severity  he admired her condescension accused himself for exacting it  he longed to ask her pardon he did not know how  a cheerful reply from her to a question of miss woodleys embarrassed him still more  he wished she had been fullen he then would have had a temptation or a pretense to have been so too  with all these thoughts crowding fast on his mind he still read or seemed to read and to take no notice of what was passing till a servant entered and asked miss milner what time she should want the chariot to which she replied i dont go out to night  he then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servent had left the room thus began  miss milner i give you i fear some unkind proofs of my regard  it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome  sometimes unmannerly  forgive the duty of my office and believe no one is half so much concerned if it robs you of any amusements as i myself am  what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his behavior she must have forgiven him for the regret he so forcibly expressed  she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore as soon as she attempted she desisted  on this he rose from his seat and going to her said once more show your submission by obeying me a second time to day  keep your appointment and be assured i shall issue my commands with greater circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with  miss milner the gay the proud the haughty miss milner sunk underneath this kindness and wept with a gentleness and patience which did not give more surprise than it gave satisfaction to dorriforth  he was charmed to find her disposition so little untractable  forboded the future prosperity of his guardianship and her eternal as well as temporal happiness from this specimen  chapter viii although dorriforth was that good man that has been described there was in his nature shades of evil  there was an obstinacy such as he himself and his friends termed firmness of mind but had not religion and some opposite virtues weighed heavy in the balance it would frequently have degenerated into implacable stubbornness  the child of a once beloved sister who married a young officer against her brothers consent was at the age of three years left an orphan destitute of every support but from his uncles generosity but though dorriforth mentioned he would never see him miss milner whose heart was a receptacle for the unfortunate no sooner was told the melancholy history of mr and mrs rusbrook the parents of the child than she longed to behold the innocent inheritor of her guardians resentment and took miss woodley with her to see the boy  he was at a farm house a few miles from town and his extreme beauty and engaging manners needed not the sorrows to which he had been born to give him farther recommendation to the kindness of her who had come to visit him she beheld him with admiration and pity and having endeared herself to him by the most affectionate words and caresses on her bidding him farewell he cried most sorrowfully to go along with her unused to resist temptations whether to reprehensible or to laudable actions she yielded to his supplications and having overcome a few scruples of miss woodleys determined to take young rusbrook to town and present him to his uncle this idea was no sooner formed than executed  by making a present to the nurse she readily gained her consent to part with him for a day or two and the signs of joy the child denoted on being put into the carriage seemed to repay her beforehand for every reproof she might receive from her guardian for the liberty she had taken  besides said she to miss woodley who had still her apprehensions do you not wish his uncle should have some warmer interest in his care than duty  it is that alone which induces mr dorriforth to provide for him but it is proper affection should have some share in his benevolence  and how hereafter will he be so fit an object for that love which compassion must excite as he is at present  miss woodley acquiesced  but before they arrived at their own door it came into miss milners remembrance there was a grave sternness in the manners of her guardian when provoked the recollection of which made her something apprehensive for what she had done  miss woodley was more so  they both became silent as they approached the street where they lived  for miss woodley having once represented her fears and having suppressed them in resignation to miss milners better judgment would not repeat them  and miss milner would not confess they were now troubling her  just however as the coach stopped she had the forecast and the humility to say we will not tell mr dorriforth the child is his nephew miss woodley unless he should appear fond and pleased with him and then we may venture without any danger  this was agreed and when dorriforth entered the room just before dinner poor harry rusbrook was introduced to him as the son of a lady who frequently visited there the deception passed  dorriforth shook hands with him and at length highly pleased with his engaging wiles and applicable replies took him on his knee and kissed him with affection miss milner could scarcely restrain the joy this gave her but unluckily dorriforth said soon after to the child and now tell me your name  harry rusbrook replied he with great force and clearness in his voice  dorriforth was holding him fondly round the waist as he stood with his feet upon his knees and at this reply he did not throw him from him  but he removed his hands which supported him so suddenly that the child to prevent falling on the floor threw himself about his uncles neck  miss milner and miss woodley turned aside to conceal their tears i had liked to have been down cried harry fearing no other danger  but his uncle took hold of each hand that had twined around him and placed him immediately on the ground and dinner being that instant served he gave no greater marks of his resentment than calling for his hat and walking instantly out of the house  miss milner cried for anger yet she did not treat with less kindness the object of this vexatious circumstance she held him in her arms all the while she sat at table and repeatedly said to him though he had not the sense to thank her she would always be his friend  the first emotions of resentment against dorriforth being over she was easily prevailed upon to return with poor rusbrook to the farm house before it was likely his uncle should come back another instance of obedience which miss woodley was impatient her guardian should know she therefore enquired where he was and sent him a note to acquaint him with it offering at the same time an apology for what had happened he returned in the evening seemingly reconciled nor was a word mentioned of the incident which had occurred during the day yet there remained in the austere looks of dorriforth a perfect remembrance of it and not one trait of compassion for his helpless nephew  chapter ix there are few things so mortifying to a proud spirit as to suffer by immediate comparison  men can scarcely bear this humiliation but to women the punishment is intolerable and miss milner now labored under the disadvantage to a degree which gave her no small inquietude  miss fenton a young lady of the most delicate beauty elegant manners gentle disposition and discreet conduct was introduced to miss milners acquaintance by her guardian and frequently sometimes inadvertently held up by him as a pattern for her to follow  for when he did not say this in direct terms it was insinuated by the warmth of his panegyricks on those virtues in which miss fenton excelled and his ward was obviously deficient conscious of her inferiority in these subjects of her guardians praise miss milner instead of being inspired to emulation was provoked to envy  not to admire miss fenton was impossible  to find a fault in her person or sentiments was equally impossible  and yet to love her was very unlikely  that serinity of mind which kept her features in a continual placid form though enchanting at the first glance upon a second or third fatigued the sight for a want of variety and to have seen her distorted with rage convulsed with mirth or in deep dejection had been to her advantage  but her superior soul appeared above those natural commotions of the mind and there was more inducement to worship her as a saint than to love her as a woman  yet dorriforth whose heart was not formed at least not educated for love regarding her in the light of friendship beheld her as the most perfect model for her sex lord frederick on first seeing her was struck with her beauty and miss milner apprehended she had introduced a rival but he had not seen her three times before he called her the most insufferable of heavens creatures and vowed there was more charming variation in the features of miss woodley  miss milner had a heart affectionate to her sex even where she saw them in the possession of charms superior to her own but whether from the spirit of contradiction whether from feeling herself more than ordinarily offended by her guardians praise of this lady or whether there was something in the reserve of miss fenton that did not accord with her own frank and ingenuous disposition so as to engage her esteem it is certain she took infinite satisfaction in hearing her beauty and her virtues depreciated or turned to ridicule particularly if mr dorriforth was present this was very painful to him upon many accounts perhaps regard to miss milners conduct was not among the least and whenever the circumstance occurred he could with difficulty restrain his anger miss fenton was not only a young lady whose amiable qualities dorriforth admired but she was soon to be allied to him by her marriage with his nearest relation lord elmwood a young nobleman whom he sincerely loved  lord elmwood had discovered all that beauty in miss fenton which every common observer could not but see  the charms of her mind and her fortune had been pointed out to him by his tutor and the utility of their marriage in perfect submission to his precepts his lordship never permitted himself to question  this preceptor held with a magisterial power the government of his pupils passions nay governed them so entirely no one could perceive nor did the young lord himself know that he had any  this rigid monitor and friend was a mr sandford bred a jesuit in the same college where dorriforth was educated but before his time the order was compelled to take another name  sandford had been the tutor of dorriforth as well as of his cousin lord elmwood and by this double tie seemed now entailed upon the family  as a jesuit he was consequently a man of learning possessed of steadiness to accomplish the end of any design once meditated and of wisdom to direct the conduct of men more powerful but less ingenious than himself the young earl accustomed in his infancy to fear him as his master in his youth and manhood received every new indulgence with which his preceptor favored him with gratitude and became at length to love him as his father  nor had dorriforth as yet shook off similar sensations  mr sandford perfectly knew how to work upon the passions of all human nature but yet had the conscience not to draw all hearts toward him  there were of mankind those whose hate he thought not unworthy his holy labor and in that he was more rapid in his success than even in procuring esteem in this enterprise he succeeded with miss milner even beyond his most sanguine wish  she had been educated at an english boarding school and had no idea of the superior and subordinate state of a foreign seminary  besides as a woman she was privileged to say any thing she pleased and as a beautiful woman she had a right to expect whatever she pleased to say should be admired  sandford knew the hearts of women as well as those of men notwithstanding he had passed but little of his time in their society  he saw miss milners heart at the first view of her person and beholding in that little circumference a weight of folly he wished to see eradicated he began to toil in the vineyard eager to draw upon him her detestation in the hope he could also make her abominate herself the mortifications of slight he was expert in and being a man of talents such as all companies especially those miss milner often frequented looked on with respect he did not begin by wasting that reverence so highly valued upon ineffectual remonstrances of which he could foresee the reception but awakened the attention of the lady solely by his neglect of her he spoke of her in her presence as of an indifferent person sometimes forgot to name her when the subject required it and then would ask her pardon and say he did not recollect her with such seeming sorrow for his fault she could not think the offense intended and of course felt the affront much more severely  while with every other person she was the principle the first cause upon which a whole company depended for conversation music cards or dancing with mr sandford she found she was of no importance  sometimes she tried to consider this disregard of her as merely the effect of illbreeding but he was not an illbred man he was a gentleman by birth and one who had kept the best company a man of sense and learning  and does such a man slight me without knowing it she cried  for she had not dived so deep into the powers of simulation as to suspect such careless manners were the result of art  this behavior of mr sandfords had its desired effect it humbled miss milner in her own opinion more than a thousand sermons would have done preached on the vanity of youth and beauty she felt an inward nothingness she never knew before and had been cured of all her pride had she not possessed a degree of spirit beyond the generality of her sex and such as even mr sandford with all his penetration did not expect  she determined to resent his treatment and entering the list as his declared enemy give reasons to the beholders why he did not with them acknowledge her sovereignty  she now commenced hostilities on all his arguments his learning and his favorite axioms and by a happy turn for ridicule in want of other weapons threw in the way of the holy father as great trials for his patience as any his order could have substituted in penance some things he bore like a martyr  at others his fortitude would forsake him and he would call on her guardian his late pupil to interpose with his authority on which she would declare she only acted to try the good mans temper and had he combated with his fretfulness but a few minutes longer she would have acknowledged his right to cannonization but having yielded to the sallies of his anger he must now go through numerous other probations  if miss fenton was admired by dorriforth by sandford she was adored  and instead of giving her as an example to miss milner he spoke of her as of one endowed beyond miss milners power of imitation  often with a shake of his head and a sigh would he say  no i am not so hard upon you as your guardian i only desire you to love miss fenton to resemble her i believe is above your ability  this was something too much  and poor miss woodley who was generally a witness of these controversies suffered a degree of sorrow at every sentence that distressed miss milner  yet as she suffered for mr sandford too the joy of her friends reply was abated by the uneasiness it gave to him but mrs horton felt for none but the right reverend priest and often did she feel so violently interested in his cause she could not refrain giving an answer herself in his behalf  thus doing the duty of an adversary  chapter x mr sandford finding his friend dorriforth frequently perplexed in the management of his ward and he himself thinking her incorrigible gave his advice that a proper match should be immediately sought out for her and the care of so dangerous a person given into other hands dorriforth acknowledged the propriety of this council but lamented the difficulty there was in pleasing his ward as to the quality of her lover for she had refused besides sir edward ashton many others of equal pretensions depend upon it then cried mr sandford her affections are already engaged and it is proper you should know to whom  dorriforth thought he did know and mentioned lord frederick lawnly but said he had no farther authority for the supposition than what his observation had given him for that every explanation both on his lordships side and on that of the ladys were evaded  take her then cried sandford into the country and if his lordship does not follow there is an end to your suspicions  i shall not easily prevail upon miss milner to leave the town replied dorriforth while it is in its highest fashion while all the gay world are resorted hither  you can but try returned sandford and if you should not succeed now at least fix the time you mean to go during the autumn and keep to your determination  but in the autumn replied dorriforth lord frederick will of course be in the country and as his uncles estate is near to our residence he will not then so evidently follow miss milner as he would could i induce her to go now  it was agreed the attempt should be made  and instead of receiving the proposal with uneasiness miss milner to the surprise of every one present immediately consented and gave her guardian an opportunity of saying several of the kindest and politest things upon her ready compliance  a token of approbation from you mr dorriforth returned she i always considered with the highest estimation  but your commendations are now become infinitely superior in value by their scarcity for i do not believe that since miss fenton and mr sandford came to town i have received one testimony of your friendship  had these words been uttered with pleasantry they might have passed without observation but at the conclusion of the period resentment flew to miss milners face and she darted a piercing look at mr sandford which more pointedly expressed she was angry with him than had she spoken volumes in her usual strain of raillery  dorriforth looked confused  but the concern which she had so plainly evinced for his good opinion throughout what she had said silenced any rebuke he might else have been tempted to give her for this unwarrantable charge against his friend  mrs horton was shocked at the irreverent manner in which mr sandford was treated  while miss woodley turned to him with a smile upon her face hoping to set him an example of the manner in which he should receive this reproach  her good wishes did not succeed  yet he was perfectly unruffled and replied with coolness  the air of the country has affected the young lady already  but it is a comfortable thing continued he that in the variety of humors some women are exposed to they cannot be steadfast even in deceit  deceit cried miss milner in what am i deceitful did i ever pretend sir i had an esteem for you  that had not been deceit madam but merely good manners  i never mr sandford sacrificed truth to politeness  except when the country has been proposed and you thought it politeness to appear satisfied  and i was satisfied till i recollected you might probably be of the party  then every grove was changed to a wilderness every rivulet into a stagnated pool and every singing bird into a croaking raven  a very poetical description returned he calmly  but miss milner you need not have had any apprehensions of my company in the country for i understand the seat to which your guardian means to go belongs to you and depend upon it madam i shall never enter a house where you are the mistress  nor any house i am certain mr sandford but where you yourself are the master  what do you mean madam and for the first time he elevated his voice am i the master here  your servants replied she looking at the company will not tell you so but i do  you condescend mr sandford cried mrs horton in talking so much to a young woman but i know you do it for her good  well miss milner cried dorriforth and the most cutting thing he could say since i find my proposal of the country has put you out of humor i shall mention it no more  with all that vast quantity of resentment anger or rage which sometimes boiled in the veins of miss milner she was yet never wanting in that respect toward her guardian which withheld her from uttering one angry sentence immediately directed to him and a severe word on his side instead of exasperating was sure to soften her such was the case at present  his words seemed to cut her to the heart but she had not the asperity to reply to them as she thought they merited and she burst into tears  dorriforth instead of being concerned as he usually was at seeing her uneasy appeared on the present occasion provoked  he thought her weeping was a new reproach to his friend mr sandford and to suffer himself to be moved by it he considered would be a tacit condemnation of his friends conduct  she understood his thoughts and getting the better of her tears apologized for the weakness of which she had been guilty adding  she could never bear with indifference an unjust accusation  to prove mine was such madam replied dorriforth be prepared to quit london without any marks of regret within a few days  she bowed assent the necessary preparations were agreed upon and while miss milner with apparent satisfaction adjusted the plan of her journey like those persons who behave well not so much to please themselves as to vex their enemies she secretly triumphed in the mortification she supposed mr sandford would receive from her obedient behavior  the news of this intended journey was soon made public there is a secret charm in being pitied when the misfortune is but ideal and miss milner found immense gratification in being told here is was a cruel case and that it was unjust and barbarous to force so much beauty to be concealed in the country while london was filled with admirers who like her would languish in consequence of the separation these things and a thousand such a thousand times repeated she still listened to with pleasure yet preserved the constancy not to shrink from her resolution of submitting  those sighs which miss woodley had long ago observed became however more frequent still and a tear half starting to her eye was an additional matter of her friends observation yet though miss milner at those times was softened to melancholy she by no means appeared unhappy miss woodley was acquainted with the name of love only yet she concluded from these increased symptoms what she before only suspected that love must be then basis her senses have been captivated by the person and accomplishments of lord frederick said miss woodley to herself while her understanding beholds his faults and reproaches her passion  and oh cried she could her guardian and mr sandford know of this conflict how much more would they have to admire than to condemn  with these friendly thoughts joined to the most perfect good intent miss woodley did not fail to give both gentlemen cause to believe a contention of this nature was the present state of miss milners mind  dorriforth was affected at the description and sandford urged more than ever the necessity of the country expedition  in a few days time they undertook it mrs horton miss woodley miss milner and mr dorriforth accompanied by miss fenton whom miss milner as she knew it to be the wish of her guardian invited to pass the three months previous to her marriage at her country seat elmwood house or rather castle the seat of lord elmwood was only a few miles from this residence and his lordship was expected to pass great part of the summer there with his tutor mr sandford  in the neighborhood was also an estate belonging to an uncle of lord fredericks and many of the company suspected they should soon see his lordship on a visit there and to that expectation did they in great measure attribute miss milners visible content  chapter xi with this party miss milner arrived at her country house and for near six weeks all around was the perfect picture of tranquillity  her satisfaction was as evident as every other persons and every severe reflection being at this time unnecessary either to teize her to her duty or to warn her against her follies she was even in perfect good humor with miss fenton and added to the hospitality of a host the kindness of a friend  mr sandford who came with lord elmwood to the neighboring seat about a week after the arrival of miss milner at here is was so scrupulous exact in the observance of his word  never to enter a house of miss milners that he would not even call upon his friend dorriforth there  but in their walks and at lord elmwoods the two parties would occasionally join and of course sandford and she at those times met  yet so distant was the reserve on either side that not a single word was upon any occasion ever exchanged between them  miss milner did not like mr sandford yet as there was no real cause for inveterate rancour admiring him too as a man who meant well and being besides of a most forgiving temper she frequently felt concerned that he did not speak to her although it had been to find fault as usual  and one morning as they were all after a long ramble drawing toward her house where lord elmwood was invited to dine she even burst into tears at seeing sandford turn back and wish them a good day  but though she had generosity to forgive an affront she had not the humility to make a concession and she foresaw that nothing less than some very humble atonement on her part would prevail upon the haughty priest to be reconciled dorriforth saw her concern upon this trifling occasion with a secret pleasure and an admiration she had never before excited she insinuated to him to be a mediator between them but before any accommodation could take place the peace and composure of their abode was disturbed by the arrival of sir edward ashton at lord elmwoods where it appeared as if he had been invited in order to pursue his matrimonial plan  at a dinner at lord elmwoods sir edward was announced as an unexpected visiter miss milner did not suppose him such and turned pale when his name was uttered  dorriforth fixed his eyes upon her with some tokens of compassion while sandford seemed to exult and by his repeated welcomes to the baronet gave evident proofs how much he was rejoiced to see him all the declining enmity of miss milner was renewed at this behavior and suspecting sandford to be the instigator of his visit she could not overcome her displeasure but gave way to it in a manner she thought the most mortifying  sir edward in the course of conversation enquired what neighbors were in the country and she with the highest appearance of satisfaction named lord frederick lawnly as one who was hourly expected at his uncles the color spread over sir edwards face  dorriforth looked confounded  and mr sandford as if he could have struck her  did lord frederick tell you he should be down sandford asked of dorriforth  to which he replied no  but i hope mr sandford you will permit me to know cried miss milner  for as she now meant to torment him by what she said she no longer constrained herself to silence  and as he harbored the same kind intent toward her he had no longer any objection to make a reply and therefore answered  no madam if it depended upon my permission you should not know  not any thing sir i dare say  you would keep me in utter ignorance  i would  from a selfinterested motive mr sandford  that i might have a greater respect for you  some of the persons present laughed  mrs horton coughed  miss woodley blushed  lord elmwood sneered  dorriforth frowned  and miss fenton looked just as she did before  the conversation was changed as soon as possible and early in the evening the company returned home  miss milner had scarce left her dressing room where she had been taking off some part of her dress when dorriforths servant came to acquaint her his master was alone in his study and begged to speak with her  she felt herself tremble  she immediately experienced a consciousness she had not acted properly at lord elmwoods for she had a prescience her guardian was going to upbraid her and her heart told her he had never yet reproached her without a cause  miss woodley just then entered the apartment and she even found herself so much a coward as to propose her going to dorriforth along with her and aiding her with a word or two occasionally in her excuse  what you my dear returned miss woodley who not two hours ago had the courage to vindicate your own cause before a whole company of whom many were your adversaries do you want an advocate before your guardian only and he who has ever treated you with tenderness  it is that tenderness which frightens me miss woodley that intimidates and strikes me dumb  is it possible i can return impertinence to the language and manners mr dorriforth uses and as i am debarred from that what can i do but stand before him like a guilty creature acknowledging my faults  she again entreated miss woodley to go with her but on a positive refusal from the impropriety of such an intrusion she was at length obliged to go by herself  how much do different circumstances influence not only the manners but even the persons of some people  miss milner in the drawing room at lord elmwoods surrounded by listeners by admirers for even her enemies beheld her with admiration and warm with their approbation and applause  and miss milner with no giddy observer to give a false eclat to her actions left destitute of all but her own understanding which secretly condemns her and upon the point of receiving the censure of her guardian and friend are two different beings  though still beautiful beyond description she does not look even in person the same  in the last mentioned situation she was shorter in stature than in the former  she was paler  she was thinner  and a very different contour presided over her whole air and all her features  when she arrived at the study door she opened it with a trepidation she could hardly account for and entered to dorriforth the altered woman she has been represented his heart had taken the most decided part against her and his face assumed the most severe aspect of reproach when her appearance gave an instantaneous change to his whole mind and countenance  she halted as if she feared to approach  he hesitated as if he knew not how to speak  instead of the warmth with which he was prepared to begin his voice involuntarily softened and without knowing what he said he began  my dear miss milner   she expected he was angry and in her confusion his gentleness was lost upon her  she imagined what he said might be severe and she continued to tremble although he repeatedly assured her he meant only to advise not to upbraid her  for in respect to all those little disputes between mr sandford and you said he i should be partial if i blamed you more than him  indeed when you take the liberty to censure him his character makes the freedom appear in a more serious light than when he complains of you  yet if he provokes your retorts he alone must answer for them nor will i undertake to decide betwixt you  but i have a question to ask you and to which i require a serious and unequivocal answer  do you expect lord frederick in the country  without hesitation she replied she did  i have one more question to ask madam and to which i expect a reply equally unreserved  is lord frederick the man you approve for a husband  upon this close interrogation she discovered an embarrassment and a confusion beyond any she had ever before given proofs of and in this situation she faintly replied  no he is not  your words tell me one thing answered dorriforth while your looks declare another  which am i to trust  which you please she returned with an insulted dignity that astonished awed yet did not convince him  but then why encourage him to follow you hither miss milner  why commit a thousand follies she replied in tears every hour of my life  you then promote the hopes of lord frederick without one serious intention of completing them this is a conduct which it is my duty to guard you against and you shall no longer deceive either him or yourself the moment he arrives it is my fixed resolution you refuse to see him or agree to become his wife  in answer to this she appeared averse both to the one proposition and the other yet came to no explanation why but left her guardian at the conclusion of the conversation as much at a loss to decide upon her real sentiments as he was before he had thus seriously requested to be informed of them but having steadfastly taken the resolution which he had declared to her he found that determination a certain relief to his mind  chapter xii sir edward ashton though not invited by miss milner yet frequently did himself the favor to come to her house sometimes he accompanied lord elmwood on a visit to her at other times he came to see dorriforth only who generally introduced him to the ladies but sir edward was either so unwilling to give pain to the object of his love or so much intimidated by her frowns that he seldom addressed a single word to her except the common compliments at entering and retiring  this apprehension of offending without one hope of pleasing had the most awkward effect upon the manners of the worthy baronet and his endeavors to insinuate himself into the affections of the woman he loved merely by the means of not giving her offense either by speaking or looking at her was a circumstance so whimsical that it frequently forced a smile from miss milner though the very name of sir edward was of power to throw a gloom over her face for she looked upon him as the cause why she should be hurried to make an election of a lover before her own mind could well direct her where to fix  besides his pursuit was a trouble while it was not the smallest triumph to her vanity which by the addresses of lord frederick was in the highest manner gratified  his lordship now arrives in the country and calls at miss milners her guardian sees his chariot coming along the lawn and gives orders to the servants to say their lady is not at home but that mr dorriforth is lord frederick leaves his compliments and goes away  the ladies all saw his carriage and servants at the door miss milner flew to the glass to adjust her dress and in her looks expressed signs of palpitation  but in vain she keeps her eyes fixed upon the door of the apartment he does not enter  after some minutes expectation the door opens and her guardian comes in she was disappointed he perceived she was and he looked at her with a very serious face she immediately called to mind the assurance he had given her that her acquaintance with lord frederick in its present state should not continue and between chagrin and confusion she was at a loss how to behave  notwithstanding the ladies were all present dorriforth said to her without the smallest reserve perhaps miss milner you may think i have taken an unwarrantable liberty in giving orders to your servants to deny you to lord frederick but until his lordship and i have had a private conference or you condescend to declare your sentiments more fully in regard to his visits i think it my duty to put an end to them  you will always perform your duty mr dorriforth i have no doubt whether i concur or not  yet believe me madam i should do it much more cheerfully could i hope it was scantioned by your inclinations  i am not mistress of my inclinations sir or they should conform to yours  place them under my direction madam and i will answer they will  a servant entered  lord frederick is returned sir and says he should be glad to see you  show him into the study cried dorriforth hastily and rising from his seat left the room  i hope they will not quarrel said mrs horton meaning she thought they would  i am sorry to see you so uneasy miss milner said miss fenton with the most perfect unconcern  as the badness of the weather had prevented their usual mornings exercise the ladies sat employed at their needles till the dinner bell called them away  do you think lord frederick is gone then whispered miss milner to miss woodley  i think not returned miss woodley  go ask of the servants dear creature and miss woodley went out of the room  she soon returned and said apart he is now getting into his chariot i saw him pass hastily through the hall he seemed to fly  ladies the dinner is waiting cried mrs horton and they repaired to the dining room where dorriforth soon after came and engrossed their whole attention by his disturbed looks and unusual silence before dinner was over he was however more himself but still he appeared thoughtful and dissatisfied at the time of their evening walks he excused himself and was seen in a distant field with mr sandford in earnest conversation for they frequently stopped on one spot for a quarter of an hour as if the interest of the subject had so totally engaged them they stood still without knowing it lord elmwood who had joined the ladies walked home with them dorriforth entered soon after in a much less gloomy humor than when he went out and told his lordship he and the ladies would dine with him tomorrow if he was disengaged and it was fixed they should  still dorriforth was in some perturbation but the immediate cause was concealed till the next day when about an hour before the companys departure from the castle miss milner and miss woodley were desired by a servant to walk into a separate apartment where they found dorriforth with mr sandford waiting their coming her guardian made an apology to miss milner for the form the ceremony of which he was going to make use but he trusted the extreme weight with which his mind was oppressed lest he should mistake the real sentiments of a lady whose happiness depended upon his being correct in the knowledge of them he trusted that would plead his excuse  i know miss milner continued he the world in general allows to unmarried women great latitude in disguising their mind with respect to the man they love  i too am willing to pardon any little dissimulation that is but consistent with that modesty becoming every woman on the subject of marriage but to what point i may limit or you may think proper to extend this kind of venial deceit may so widely differ that it is not impossible i remain wholly unacquainted with your sentiments even after you have revealed them to me  under this consideration i wish once more to hear your thoughts in regard to matrimony and to hear them before one of your own sex that i may be enabled to form my opinion by her constructions  to all this serious oration miss milner made no other reply than by turning to mr sandford and asking if he was the person of her own sex to whose judgment her guardian meant to submit his own  madam cried sandford very angrily you are come hither upon serious business  any business must be serious to me mr sandford in which you are concerned and if you had called it sorrowful the epithet would have suited as well  miss milner said her guardian i did not bring you here to contend with mr sandford  then why sir bring him hither for where he and i are there must be contention  i brought him hither madam or rather brought you to this house merely that he might be present on this occasion and with his discernment relieve me from a suspicion that my own judgment can neither suppress or confirm  is there any more company you may wish to call in sir to clear up your doubts of my veracity if so pray send for them before you begin your interrogations  he shook his head  she continued the whole world is welcome to hear what i say and every different judge welcome if they please to judge me differently  dear miss milner  cried miss woodley with a tone of reproach for the vehemence with which she spoke  perhaps miss milner said dorriforth you will not now reply to those questions i was going to put to you  did i ever refuse sir returned she with a selfapproving air to comply with any request you have seriously made me have i ever refused to obey your commands whenever you thought proper to lay them upon me if not you have no right to suppose i will now  he was going to reply when mr sandford sullenly interrupted him and making toward the door cried when you come to the point for which you brought me here send for me again  stay now cried dorriforth and miss milner continued he i not only entreat but command you to tell me  have you given your promises your word or your affections to lord frederick lawnley  the color spread over her face and she replied  i thought confessions were only permitted in secrecy however as i am not a member of your church i submit to the persecution of a heretic and answer  lord frederick has neither my word my promise nor any share in my affections  sandford dorriforth and miss woodley all looked at each other with a surprise that was for some time dumb  at length dorriforth said and it is your firm intention never to become his wife  to which she answered  at present it is  at present do you suspect you shall change your sentiments  women sometimes do  but before that change can take place madam your acquaintance will be broken off for it is that i shall next insist upon and to which you can have no objection  she replied i had rather it would continue  on what account cried dorriforth  because it entertains me  for shame for shame returned he it endangers both your character and your happiness  yet again do not suffer me to break with his lordship if should like to become his wife if in that respect it militates against your felicity  by no means she answered lord frederick makes part of my amusement but could never constitute my felicity  miss woodley said dorriforth do you comprehend your friend in the same literal and unequivocal sense i do  certainly i do sir answered miss woodley  and pray miss woodley said he were those the sentiments which you have always entertained  miss woodley hesitated  he continued or has the present conversation altered them  she hesitated again then answered  the present conversation has altered them  and yet you confide in it cried sandford looking at her with contempt  certainly i do replied miss woodley  do not you then mr sandford asked dorriforth  i would advise you to act the same as if i did replied sandford  then miss milner said dorriforth you see lord frederick no more  and i hope i have your permission to tell him so  you have sir she replied with a completely unembarrassed countenance and voice  miss woodley looked hard at her to discover some lurking wish adverse to all these protestations but she could not discern one  sandford too fixed his penetrating eyes as if he would look through her soul but finding it perfectly composed he cried out  why then not write his lordships dismission herself and save you mr dorriforth the trouble of any farther contest with him  indeed miss milner said dorriforth that would oblige me for it is with the greatest reluctance i meet his lordship upon this subject  he was extremely impatient and importunate the last time he was with me  he took advantage of my ecclesiastic situation to treat me with a levity and illbreeding i could ill have suffered upon any other consideration than the complying with my duty to you  dictate what you please mr dorriforth and i will write it said she with a warmth like the most unaffected inclination  and while you sir she continued are so indulgent as not to distress me with the importunities of any gentleman to whom i am averse i think myself equally bound to rid you of the impertinence of every one to whom you may have objection  but answered he be assured i have no material objection to my lord frederick except from that dilemma into which your acquaintance with him has involved us all and the same i should conceive against any other man where the same circumstance occurred  as you have now however freely and politely consented to the manner in which it has been proposed you shall break with him i will not trouble you a moment longer upon a subject on which i have so frequently explained my wishes but conclude it by assuring you your ready acquiescence has given me the sincerest satisfaction  i hope mr sandford said she turning to him with a smile i have given you satisfaction likewise  sandford could not say yes and was ashamed to say no he therefore made no answer except by his looks which were full of suspicion she notwithstanding made him a very low courtesy  her guardian then handed her out of the apartment into her coach which was waiting to take her miss woodley and himself home  chapter xiii notwithstanding the seeming readiness with which miss milner had resigned all farther acquaintance with lord frederick during the short ride home she appeared to have lost great part of her wonted spirits she was thoughtful and once sighed most heavily dorriforth began to fear she had not only made a sacrifice of her affections but of her varacity yet why she had done so he could not comprehend  as the carriage moved slowly through a lane between elmwood castle and her house on casting her eyes out of the window miss milners countenance was brightened in an instant and that instant lord frederick on horseback was at the coach door and the coachman stopped  oh miss milner cried he with a voice and manner that could give little suspicion of the truth of what he said i am overjoyed at the happiness of seeing you even though it is but an accidental meeting  she was evidently glad to see him but the earnestness with which he spoke put her upon her guard not to express the like and she said in a cool constrained manner she was glad to see his lordship  the reserve with which she spoke gave lord frederick immediate suspicion who was in the coach with her and turning his head quickly he met the stern eye of dorriforth upon which without the smallest salutation he turned from him again abruptly and rudely miss milner was confused and miss woodley in torture at the palbable affront to which dorriforth alone appeared indifferent  go on said miss milner to the footman desire the coachman to drive on  no cried lord frederick not till you have told me when i shall see you again  i will write you word my lord replied she something alarmed you shall have a letter immediately after i get home  as if he guessed what its contents were to be he cried out with warmth take care then madam how you treat me in that letter  and you mr dorriforth turning to him do you take care what it contains for if it is dictated by you to you i shall send the answer  dorriforth without making his lordship a reply or casting a look at him put his head out of the window on the opposite side and called in a very angry tone to the coachman how dare you not drive on when your lady orders you  the sound of dorriforths voice in anger was to the servants so unusual it acted like a stroke of electricity on the man and he drove on at the instant so swiftly that lord frederick was in a moment left many yards behind as soon however as he recovered from the surprise into which this sudden command had thrown him he rode with speed after the carriage and followed it till they all arrived at the door of miss milners house there his lordship giving himself up to the rage of love or to rage against dorriforth for the contempt with which he had treated him leapt from his horse as miss milner stepped from her carriage and seizing her hand entreated her not to desert him in compliance to the monastic precepts of hypocrisy  dorriforth heard this standing silently by with a manly scorn painted on his countenance  miss milner struggled to loose her hand saying excuse me from replying to you now my lord  in return to which his lordship brought her hand to his lips and began to devour it with kisses when dorriforth with an instantaneous impulse rushed forward and struck him a blow in the face  under the force with which this assault was given and the astonishment it excited his lordship staggered and letting fall the hand of miss milner her guardian immediately laid hold of it and led her into the house  she was terrified beyond description and it was with difficulty mr dorriforth could get her to her own chamber without taking her in his arms  when with the assistance of her woman he had placed her upon a sopha  all shame and confusion for what he had done he dropped upon his knees before her and earnestly entreated her forgiveness for the indelicacy he had been guilty of in her presence  and that he had alarmed her and lost sight of the respect which he thought sacredly her due seemed to be the only circumstance that dwelt upon his thoughts  she felt the indecorum of the posture he had condescended to take and was shocked  to see her guardian at her feet struck her with the same impropriety as if she had beheld a parent there and all agitation and emotion she implored him to rise and with a thousand protestations declared she thought the rashness of the act was the highest proof of his regard for her  miss woodley now entered for her care being ever employed upon the unfortunate lord frederick on this occasion had been the object of it and she had waited by his side and with every good purpose preached patience to him while he was smarting under the pain and shame of his chastisement  at first his fury threatened to retort upon the servants around him and who refused his entrance into the house the punishment he had received  but in the certainty of an honorable amends which must hereafter be made he overcame the many temptations which the moment offered and remounting his horse rode from the place  no sooner had miss woodley entered the room and dorriforth had resigned to her the care of his ward than he flew to the spot where he had left his lordship negligent what might have been the event had he still remained there  after enquiring and being told he was gone dorriforth returned to his own apartment and with a bosom torn by more excruciating sensations far than those he had given to his adversary  the remorse that first struck him as he shut the door upon himself was  i have departed from my character  from the sacred character and dignity of my profession and sentiments  i have departed from myself  i am no longer the philosopher but the ruffian  i have treated with an unpardonable insult a young nobleman whose only crime was love and a fond desire to insinuate himself into the favor of his mistress  i must atone for this outrage in whatever manner he may choose and the law of justice and equity though in this one instance contrary to the law of religion enjoins that if he demands my life in satisfaction for his wounded honor it is his due alas cried he that i could have laid it down this morning unsullied with the cause for which it will make but poor atonement  he next reflected  i have offended and filled with horror a beautiful young lady whom it was my duty to have protected from the brutal manners to which i myself have exposed her  again  i have drawn upon me the just reproaches of my faithful preceptor and friend the man in whose judgment it was my delight to be approved  above all i have drawn upon myself the stings of my own conscience  where shall i pass this sleepless night cried he walking repeatedly across his chamber can i go to the ladies i am a brute unworthy such society  shall i go and repose my disturbed mind on sandford i am ashamed to tell him the cause of my uneasiness  shall i go to lord frederick and humbling myself before him beg his forgiveness he would spurn me for a coward  no  and he lifted up his eyes to heaven thou all great all wise and all omnipotent being whom i have above any other offended to thee alone i apply in this hour of tribulation and from thee alone i expect comfort  and the confidence with which i now address myself to thee encouraged by that long intercourse religion has effected in this one moment pays me amply for the many years of my past life wholly devoted to thy service  chapter xiv although miss milner had foreseen no fatal event from the indignity offered lord frederick yet she passed a night very different from those to which she had been accustomed no sooner was she falling into a sleep than a thousand vague but distressing ideas darted across her imagination  her heart would at times whisper to her as she was half asleep lord frederick is banished from you for ever  she shakes off the uneasiness this idea brings along with it  she then starts and beholds the blow still aimed at him by dorriforth  and no sooner has she driven away this painful image than she is again awakened by seeing her guardian at her feet suing for pardon  she sighs she trembles she is chilled with terror  relieved by a flood of tears toward the morning she sinks into a refreshing slumber but waking finds the selfsame images crowding all together upon her mind  she is doubtful to which to give the preference  one however rushes the foremost and will continue so  she knows not the consequence of ruminating nor why she dwells upon that more than upon all the rest and yet it will give place to none  she rises in a languid and disordered state and at breakfast adds fresh pain to dorriforth by her altered appearance  he had scarce left the breakfast room when an officer waited upon him charged with a challenge from lord frederick to the message delivered to him by this gentleman dorriforth replied  as a clergyman more especially in the church of rome i know not whether i am not exempt from answering a claim of this kind but not having had forbearance to avoid an offense i have no right to a privilege that would only indemnify me from making reparation  you will then meet his lordship sir at the appointed time said the officer  i will answered dorriforth and my immediate care shall be to procure a gentleman to accompany me  the officer withdrew and as soon as dorriforth was once more alone he was going once more to reflect but he durst not  since yesterday reflection for the first time of his life was become painful to him and even as he rode the short way to lord elmwoods immediately after he found his own thoughts so insufferable he was obliged to enter into conversation with his servant solitude that he was formerly so charmed withal at those moments had been worse than death  at lord elmwoods he met sandford in the hall and the sight of him was no longer welcome but displeasing  he knew how different the principles he had just adopted were to those of that reverend friends and without his complaining or even suspecting what had happened his presence was a sufficient reproach  dorriforth passed him as hastily as he could and enquiring for lord elmwood disclosed to him his errand which was to ask him to be his second his lordship started and wished to consult his tutor but that his kinsman strictly forbid and having urged his reasons with arguments such as his lordship could not refute he at length prevailed upon him to promise he would accompany him to the field which was at a few miles distance only and the parties were to be there at seven on the same evening  as soon as his business with lord elmwood was settled dorriforth returned home to make some necessary preparations for the event which might ensue from this meeting  he wrote letters to several of his friends and one to his ward over which he shed tears  sandford going into lord elmwoods library soon after dorriforth had left it expressed his surprise at finding him gone upon which that young nobleman after answering a few questions and giving a few significant tokens that he was entrusted with a secret frankly confessed what he had promised to conceal  sandford as much as a holy man could be was enraged at dorriforth for the cause of this challenge but was still more enraged at him for his wickedness in accepting it  he applauded his pupils virtue in making the discovery and congratulated himself that he should be the instrument of saving not only the blood of his friend but of preventing the scandal of his being engaged in a duel  in the ardour of his designs he went immediately to miss milners  entered the house he had so long refused to enter and at a time when he was on aggravated bad terms with its owner  he asked for dorriforth went hastily into his apartment and poured upon him a torrent of rebukes  dorriforth bore all he said with the patience of a devotee but with the firmness of a man  he owned his fault but no eloquence could make him recall the promise he had given to repair the injury  unshaken by the arguments persuasions and menaces of sandford he gave a fresh proof of that inflexibility for which he has been described  and after two hours dispute they parted neither of them the better for what either had advanced but dorriforth something the worse his conscience gave testimony to sandfords opinion that he was bound by ties more sacred than worldly honor but while he owned he would not yield to the duty  sandford left him determined however that lord elmwood should not be accessory in his guilt and this he declared on which dorriforth took the resolution of seeking another second  in passing through the house on his return home sandford met by accident mrs horton miss milner and the other two ladies returning from a saunter in the garden  surprised at the sight of mr sandford in her house miss milner would not express that surprise but going up to him with all the friendly benevolence which generally played about her heart she took hold of one of his hands and pressed it with a kindness which told him he was welcome more forcibly than if she had made the most elaborate speech to convince him of it  he however seemed little touched with her behavior and as an excuse for breaking his word cried  i beg your pardon madam but i was brought hither in my anxiety to prevent murder  murder exclaimed all the ladies  yes answered he addressing himself to miss fenton your betrothed husband is a party concerned he is going to be second to mr dorriforth who means this very evening to be killed by my lord frederick or to kill him in addition to the blow he gave him last night  mrs horton exclaimed if mr dorriforth dies he dies a martyr  miss woodley cried with fervor heaven forbid  miss fenton cried dear me  while miss milner without uttering one word sunk speechless on the floor  they lifted her up and brought her to the door which entered the garden she soon recovered for the tumult of her mind would not suffer her to remain inactive and she was rouzed in spite of her weakness to endeavor to ward off the present disaster  in vain however she tried to walk to dorriforths apartment  in the trial she sunk as before and was taken to a settee while miss woodley was dispatched to bring her guardian to her  informed of the cause of her swoonings he followed miss woodley with a tender anxiety for her health and with grief and confusion that he had so carelessly endangered it  on his entering the room sandford beheld the inquietude of his mind and cried here is your guardian with a cruel emphasis on the word  he was too much engaged by the indisposition of his ward to reply to sandford  he placed himself on the settee by her and with the utmost tenderness reverence and pity entreated her not to be concerned at an accident in which he and he only had been to blame but which he had still no doubt would be accommodated in the most amicable manner  i have one favor to require of you mr dorriforth said she and that is your promise your solemn promise which i know is sacred that you will not fight with my lord frederick  he hesitated  oh madam cried sandford he is grown a libertine now and i would not believe his word were he to give it you  then sir returned dorriforth angrily you may believe my word for i will keep that i have passed to you  i will give lord frederick all the restitution in my power  but my dear miss milner let not this alarm you we may not find it convenient to meet this many a day and most probably some fortunate explanation may yet take place and prevent our meeting at all if not reckon but among the many duels that are fought how few are fatal and even in that case how small would be the loss to society  he was proceeding  i should ever deplore the loss cried miss milner i could not survive the death of either in such a case  for my part returned dorriforth i look upon my life as much forfeited to his lordship to whom i have given a high offense as it might in other instances have been forfeited to the offended laws of the land honor is the law of the polite part of the land we know it and when we transgress against it knowingly we justly incur our punishment  however miss milner this business is not to be settled immediately and i have no doubt but all will be as you could wish  do you think i should appear thus easy added he with a smile if i were going to be shot at by my lord frederick  very well cried sandford with a look that demonstrated he knew better  you will stay within then all this day said miss milner  i am engaged out to dinner he replied it is unlucky  i am sorry for it  but i will be at home early in the evening  stained with human blood cried sandford or yourself a corpse  the ladies all lifted up their hands and miss milner rose from her seat and threw herself at her guardians feet  you knelt to me last night i now kneel to you she cried kneel never desiring to rise more if you persist in your intention  i am weak i am volatile i am indiscreet but i have a heart from whence some impressions can never be erased  he endeavored to raise her she persisted to kneel  and here the trouble the affright the terror she endured discovered to her for the first time her own sentiments  which till that moment she had doubted  and she continued  i no longer pretend to conceal my passion  i love lord frederick lawnly  her guardian started  yes to my shame i love him cried she all emotion i meant to have struggled with the weakness because i supposed it would be displeasing to you  but apprehension for his safety takes away every power of restraint and i beseech you to spare his life  this is exactly what i thought cried sandford triumphantly  good heaven cried miss woodley  but it is very natural said mrs horton  i own said dorriforth struck with amaze and now taking her from his feet with a force she could not resist i own miss milner i am greatly affected at this contradiction in your character   but did not i say so cried sandford interrupting him  however continued he you may take my word though you have deceived me in yours that lord fredericks life is secure  for your sake i would not endanger it for the universe  but let this be a warning to you   he was proceeding with the most poignant language and austere looks when observing the shame the terror and the selfreproach which agitated her mind he divested himself in great measure of his austerity and said mildly  let this be a warning to you how you deal in future with the friends who wish you well  you have hurried me into a mistake that might have cost me my life or the life of the man you love and thus exposed you to misery more bitter than death  i am not worthy your friendship mr dorriforth said she sobbing with grief and from this moment forsake me  no madam not in the moment you first discover to me how i can make you happy  the conversation appearing now to become of that nature in which the rest of the company could have no share whatever they all except mr sandford were retiring when miss milner called miss woodley back saying stay you with me i was never so unfit to be left without your friendship  perhaps for the present you can much easier dispense with mine said dorriforth she made no answer he therefore having once more assured her lord fredericks life was safe was quitting the room when he recollected in what a state of humiliation he had left her and turning toward her as he opened the door added  and be assured madam my esteem for you shall be the same as ever  sandford as he followed dorriforth bowed to miss milner too and repeated the selfsame words  and madam be assured my esteem for you shall be the same as ever  chapter xv this taunting reproof from sandford made little impression upon miss milner whose thoughts were all fixed on a subject of much more importance than the opinion he entertained of her  she threw her arms about miss woodley as soon as they were left alone and asked with anxiety what she thought of her behavior miss woodley who could not approve of the duplicity her friend had betrayed still wished to reconcile her as much as possible to her own conduct and replied she highly commended the frankness with which she had at last acknowledged her sentiments  frankness cried miss milner starting frankness my dear miss woodley  what you have just now heard me say is all a falsehood  how miss milner  oh my dear miss woodley returned she sobbing upon her bosom pity the agonies of my heart by nature sincere when such are the fatal propensities it cherishes i must submit to the grossest falsehoods rather than reveal the truth  what do you mean cried miss woodley with the strongest amazement painted on her face  do you suppose i love lord frederick returned the other do you suppose i can love him  oh fly miss woodley and prevent my guardian from telling him such an untruth  what do you mean repeated miss woodley i protest you frighten me  and this inconsistency in the behavior of miss milner really appeared as if her senses had been deranged  only fly resumed she and prevent the inevitable ill consequence which must ensue from lord fredericks being told this falsehood  it will involve us all in greater disquietude than we suffer at present  then what has influenced you my dear miss milner   that which impels my every action returned she an unsurmountable instinct  a fatality that will ever render me the most miserable of human beings and yet you even you my dear miss woodley will not pity me  miss woodley pressed her close in her arms and vowed that while she was unhappy from whatever cause she still would pity her  go to mr dorriforth then and prevent him from imposing upon lord frederick  but that imposition is the only means to prevent the duel replied miss woodley the moment i have told him you have no regard for his lordship he will no longer refuse to fight with him  then at all events i am undone exclaimed miss milner for the duel is horrible even beyond every thing else  how so returned miss woodley since you have declared you do not care for lord frederick  but are you so blind returned miss milner with a degree of madness in her looks to believe i do not care for mr dorriforth oh miss woodley i love him with all the passion of a mistress and with all the tenderness of a wife  miss woodley at this sentence sat down  it was on a chair that was close to her  her feet could not have taken her to any other  she trembled  she was white as ashes and deprived of speech miss milner taking her by the hand said  i know what you feel  i know what you think of me  and how much you hate and despise me  but heaven is witness to all my struggles  nor would i even to myself acknowledge the shameless prepossession till forced by a sense of his danger   silence cried miss woodley struck with horror  and even now resumed miss milner have i not concealed it from all but you by plunging myself into a new difficulty from whence i know not how i shall be extricated  and do i entertain a hope no miss woodley nor ever will  but suffer me to own my folly to you  to entreat your soothing friendship to free me from my weakness  and oh give me your friendly advice to deliver me from the difficulties which surround me  miss woodley was still pale and still silent  education is called second nature in the strict but not enlarged education of miss woodley it was more powerful than the first  and the violation of oaths persons or things consecrated to heaven was in her opinion if not the most enormous the most horrid among the catalogue of crimes  miss milner had lived too long in a family who had imbibed those opinions not to be convinced of their existence nay her own reason told her that solemn vows of whatever kind ought to be binding and the more she respected her guardians understanding the less she called in question his religious tenets  in esteeming him she esteemed all his notions and among the rest even venerated those of his religion  yet that passion which had unhappily taken possession of her whole soul would not have been inspired had there not subsisted an early difference in their systems of divine faith  had she been early taught what were the sacred functions of a roman ecclesiastic though all her esteem all her admiration had been attracted by the qualities and accomplishments of her guardian yet education would have given such a prohibition to her love that she had been precluded from it as by that barrier which divides a sister from a brother  this unfortunately was not the case and miss milner loved dorriforth without one conscious check to tell her she was wrong except that which convinced her her love would be avoided by him with detestation with horror  miss woodley something recovered from her first surprise and suffering  for never did her susceptible mind suffer so exquisitely  amidst all the grief and abhorrence she felt pity was still predominant  and reconciled to the faults of miss milner by her misery she once more looked at her with friendship and asked what she could do to render her less unhappy  make me forget replied miss milner every moment of my past life since i first saw you  that moment was teeming with a weight of cares i must labor under till my death  and even in death replied miss woodley do not be so presumptuous as to hope to shake them off  if unrepented in this world   she was proceeding  but the anxiety her friend endured would not suffer her to be wholly free from the apprehension that notwithstanding the positive assurance of her guardian should he and lord frederick me the duel might still take place she therefore rung the bell and enquired if mr dorriforth was still at home  the answer was  he is rode out  you remember said miss woodley he told you he should dine out  this did not however dismiss her fears and she dispatched two servants different ways in pursuit of him acquainting them with her suspicions and charging them to prevent his and lord fredericks meeting sandford had also taken his precautions but though he knew the time he did not know the exact place of their appointment for that lord elmwood had forgot to enquire  the excessive alarm which miss milner discovered upon this occasion was imputed by the servants and others who were witness of it to her affection for lord edward while none but miss woodley knew or had the most distant suspicion of the real cause  mrs horton and miss fenton who were sitting together expatiating on the duplicity of their own sex in the instance just before them had notwithstanding the interest of the discourse a longing desire to break it off for they were impatient to see this poor frail being whom they were loading with their innocent  as it was among friends  calumny they longed to see if she would have the confidence to look them in the face they to whom she had so often protested she had not the smallest attachment to lord frederick but from motives of vanity  these ladies heard with much satisfaction dinner was served but met miss milner at table with a less degree of pleasure than they expected for her mind was so totally abstracted from them they could not discern a single blush or confused glance which their presence occasioned no miss milner had before them divulged nothing of which she was ashamed she only was ashamed what she had said was not truth in the bosom of miss woodley alone was that secret entrusted which could call a blush into her face and before her she did feel confusion  before the gentle friend to whom she had till this time communicated all her faults without embarrassment she now cast down her eyes in shame and scarce durst lift them up to meet here is  at table there was little talking and less eating miss milner did not attempt to eat miss woodley endeavored but could not  soon after the dinner was removed lord elmwood entered and that gallant nobleman declared  mr sandford had used him ill in not permitting him to accompany his relation for he feared dorriforth would now throw himself upon the sword of lord frederick without a friend by to defend him  a rebuke from the eye of miss woodley which from this day forward had a command over miss milner restrained her from expressing the affright she suffered from this supposition of his lordships miss fenton replied as to that my lord i see no reason why mr dorriforth and lord frederick should not now be friends  certainly said mrs horton for as soon as my lord frederick is made acquainted with miss milners confession all differences must be reconciled  what confession asked his lordship  miss milner to avoid hearing a repetition of that which gave her pain but to think of arose in order to retire into her own apartment but was obliged to sit down again  and received the assistance of her friend and lord elmwood to lead her into her dressingroom reclined upon a sopha there a silence ensued between her and miss woodley for near half an hour and when the conversation began the name of dorriforth was never uttered  they were both grown cool and considerate since the discovery and both were equally ashamed and fearful of naming him  the vanity of the world the folly of riches the pleasures of retirement and such topics engaged their discourse but not their thoughts for near two hours and the first time the word dorriforth was spoken a servant with alacrity opened the dressing room door without previously rapping and cried mr dorriforth madam  dorriforth immediately came in and went eagerly to miss milner  miss woodley beheld the glow of joy and guilt upon her face and did not rise to give him her seat as was her custom if he came with intelligence to his ward and she was sitting next her  he therefore stood while he repeated all that had happened in his interview with lord frederick  but with her gladness to see her guardian safe miss milner had forgot to enquire for the safety of his lordship the man whom she had pretended to love so passionately  even a smile of rapture was upen her face though dorriforth might be returned from putting him to death this incongruity of behavior miss woodley saw and was confounded  but dorriforth in whose thoughts a suspicion either of her love to him or want of love for lord frederick had not the smallest place easily reconciled this inconsistency and said  you see by my countenance all is well and therefore you smile on me before i tell you what has passed  this brought her to the recollection of her conduct and now with a countenance constrained to some show of gravity she tried to express alarm she did not feel  nay i have the pleasure to assure you lord frederick is safe resumed dorriforth and the disgrace of his blow washed entirely away by a few drops of blood from this arm and he laid his hand upon his left arm which rested in his waistcoat as a sling  she cast her eyes there and seeing where the ball had entered the coat sleeve she gave an involuntary scream and sunk on the side of the sopha instead of that tender sympathy with which miss woodley used to attend her upon the slightest illness or affliction she now addressed her in a sharp tone and cried miss milner you have heard lord frederick is safe you have then nothing to alarm you  nor did she run to offer a smelling bottle or to raise her head her guardian seeing her near fainting and without this assistance from her friend was going himself to give it but on this miss woodley interfered and having taken her head upon her arm assured him it was a trifling weakness to which miss milner was accustomed and that she would ring for her woman who knew how to relieve her instantly with a few drops  satisfied with this dorriforth left the room and a surgeon being arrived to dress his wound he retired into his own chamber  chapter xvi the power delegated to the keeper of our secrets miss woodley was the last person on earth to abuse  but she was also the last who by her complacency would participate in the guilt of her friend  and there was no guilt except that of murder which she thought equal to the crime in question provided it was ever perpetrated  adultery her reason would perhaps have informed her was a more pernicious evil to society but to a religious mind what sounds so horrible as sacrilege of vows made to god or to man the former must weigh the heavier  moreover the dreadful sin of infidelity in the marriage state is much softened to a common understanding by the frequency of the crime whereas of vows broken by a devotee she had scarce heard of any or if any they were generally followed by such examples of divine vengeance such miraculous punishments in this world as well as eternal punishment in the other that served to exaggerate their wickedness  she who could and did pardon miss milner was the person who saw her passion in the severest light and resolved to take every method however harsh to root it from her heart  nor did she fear success resting on the certain assurance that however deep her love was fixed it would never be returned yet this confidence did not prevent her taking every precaution lest dorriforth should come to the knowledge of it  she would not have his composed mind disturbed with such a thought  his steadfast principles so much as shook by the imagination  nor overwhelm him with those selfreproaches which his fatal attraction unpremeditated as it was would still have drawn upon him  with this plan of concealment in which the natural modesty of miss milner acquiesced there was but one effort to make which that young lady was not prepared for and that was an entire separation from her guardian  she had from the first cherished her passion without the most distant prospect of a return  she was prepared to see dorriforth without ever seeing him nearer to her than her guardian and friend but not to see him at all  for that she was not prepared  but miss woodley reflected upon the inevitable necessity of this step before she made the proposal and then made it with a firmness that might have done honor to the inflexibility of dorriforth himself  during the few days that intervened between her open confession of love for lord frederick and this proposal the most intricate incoherence appeared to the whole family in the character of miss milner  and in order to evade a marriage with his lordship and to conceal at the same time the shameful propensity which lurked in her breast she was once even on the point of declaring a passion for sir edward ashton  in the duel which had taken place between lord frederick and dorriforth the latter had received his antagonists fire but positively refused to return it by which he had kept his promise not to endanger his lordships life and had reconciled sandford in great measure to his behavior  and sandford now his resolution once broken no longer refused entering miss milners house but came every time it was convenient though he yet avoided its mistress as much as possible or showed by every word and look when she was present that she was still less in his favor than she had ever been  he visited dorriforth on the evening after his engagement with lord frederick and again the next morning breakfasted with him in his own chamber nor did miss milner see her guardian since his first return from that engagement till the following noon she enquired however of the servant how his master did and was rejoiced to hear his wound was but very slight  yet this enquiry she durst not make before miss woodley but waited till she was absent  when dorriforth made his appearance the next day it was evident he had thrown from his heart a load of cares and though they had left a languor upon his face there was content in his voice his manners in his every word and action  far from seeming to retain any resentment toward his ward for the trouble and danger into which her imprudence had led him he appeared rather to pity her weakness and to wish to sooth the perturbation which the recollection of her own conduct had obviously raised in her mind  his endeavors were most successful  she was soothed every time he spoke to her and had not the watchful eye of miss woodley stood guard over her inclinations she had plainly evinced she was enraptured with the joy of seeing him again himself after the danger to which he had been exposed  these emotions which she labored to subdue passed however the bounds of her ineffectual resistance when at the time of retiring after dinner he said to her in a low voice but such as it was meant the company should hear do me the favor miss milner to call at my study sometime in the evening i have to speak to you upon business  she answered i will sir and her eyes swam with delight in expectation of the interview  let not the reader nevertheless imagine there was in that ardent expectation one idea which the most spotless mind in love might not have indulged without reproach  sincere love at least among the delicate of the female sex is often gratified by that degree of enjoyment or rather forbearance which would be torture in the pursuit of any other passion  real delicate and restrained love like that of miss milners was indulged in the sight of the object only and having bounded her wishes by her hopes the height of her happiness was limited to a conversation in which no other but themselves partook a part  miss woodley was one who heard the appointment but the only one who conceived with what sensation it was received  while the ladies remained in the same room with dorriforth miss milner thought of little except of him  as soon as they withdrew into another apartment she remembered miss woodley and turning her head suddenly saw miss woodleys face imprinted with suspicion and displeasure  this at first was painful to her  but recollecting that in a couple of hours time she was to meet her guardian alone  speak to him and hear him speak to herself only  every other thought was absorbed in that one and she considered with indifference the uneasiness or the anger of her friend  miss milner to do justice to her heart did not wish to beguile dorriforth into the snares of love  could any supernatural power have endowed her with the means and at the same time shown to her the ills that must arise from such an effect of her charms she had assuredly enough of virtue to have declined the conquest but without enquiring of herself what she proposed she never saw him without previously endeavoring to look more attractive than she would have desired in any other company  and now without listening to the thousand exhortations that were speaking in every feature of miss woodleys face she flew to a lookingglass to adjust her dress in a manner than she thought most enchanting  time stole away and the time to go to her guardian arrived in his presence unsupported by the presence of a third person every grace she had practiced every look she had borrowed to set off her charms were annihilated and she became a native beauty with the artless arguments of reason only for her aid  awed thus by his power from every thing but what she really was she never was perhaps half so bewitching as in those timid respectful and embarrassed moments she passed alone with him  he caught at those times her respect her diffidence nay even her embarrassment and never would one word of anger pass on either side  on the present occasion he first expressed the highest satisfaction that she had at length revealed to him the state of her mind  and taking every thing into consideration miss milner added he i rejoice that your sentiments happen to be such as you have owned  for although my lord frederick is not the very man i could have wished for your perfect happiness yet in the state of human perfection and human happiness you might have fixed your affections with much less propriety and yet where my unwillingness to thwart your inclinations might not have permitted me to contend with them  not a word of reply did this demand or if it had not a word could she have given  and now madam the reason of my desire to speak with you  is to know from yourself the means you think most proper to pursue in order to acquaint his lordship that notwithstanding this late repulse there are hopes of your partiality in his favor  defer the explanation returned she eagerly  i beg your pardon miss milner that cannot be  besides how can you indulge a disposition thus unpitying  even so ardently did i desire to render his lordship happy though he came armed against my life that had i not reflected previous to our engagement it would appear like fear and the means of bartering for his forgiveness i should have revealed your sentiments the moment i had seen him when the engagement was over i was too impatient to acquaint you of his safety to think then on gratifying him  and indeed the delicacy of the declaration after the many denials you have no doubt given him should be considered  i therefore entreat your approbation of the manner in which it shall be made  mr dorriforth can you allow nothing to the moments of surprise and that pity which the fate impending inspired and which might urge me to express myself of lord frederick in a manner my cooler thoughts will not warrant  there was nothing in your expressions my dear miss milner the least equivocal  if you were off your guard when you pleaded for lord frederick as i believe you were you said more sincerely what you thought and no discreet or rather indiscreet retractions can make me change my opinion  i am very sorry she replied confused and trembling  why sorry come give me commission to reveal these sentiments  i will not be too hard upon you  a hint from me to his lordship will do  hope is ever apt to interpret the slightest words to its own use and a lovers hope is beyond all others sanguine  i never gave lord frederick hope  but did you ever plunge him into despair  his pursuit says i never have but he has no other proof  however light and frivolous you have been upon frivolous subjects yet i must own miss milner i expected that when a case of this importance came seriously before you you would have discovered a proper stability in your behavior  i do sir and it was only while i was affected with a weakness which arose from accident that i have ever showed an inconsistence  you then still assert you have no affection for my lord frederick  not sufficient to become his wife  you are alarmed at marriage and i do not wonder you should be so it shows a prudent foresight that does you honor  but my dear are there no dangers in a single state  if i may judge miss milner there are many more to a young lady of your accomplishments than were you under the protection of a husband  my father mr dorriforth thought your protection sufficient  but that protection was rather to direct your choice than to be the cause of your not choosing at all  give me leave to point out an observation which perhaps i have too frequently done before but upon this occasion i must intrude it once again  miss fenton is its object  her fortune is inferior to yours her personal attractions less   here the strong glow of joy and of gratitude for an opinion so negligently and yet so sincerely expressed flew to miss milners face neck and even to her hands and fingers the blood mounted to every part of her skin that was visible for not a fiber but felt the secret transport that dorriforth thought her more beautiful than the beautiful miss fenton  if he observed her blushes he was unsuspicious of the cause and went on  there is besides in the temper of miss fenton a sedateness that might with less hazard secure her safety in an unmarried life and yet she very properly thinks it her duty as she does not mean to seclude herself by any vows to the contrary to become a wife  and in obedience to the counsel of her friends will be married within a very few weeks  miss fenton may marry from obedience i never will  you mean to say love shall alone induce you  i do  if madam you would point out a subject upon which i am the least able to speak and on which my sentiments such as they are are formed alone from theory and even there instructed but with caution it is the subject of love  and yet miss milner even that little i know tells me without a doubt that what you said to me yesterday pleading for lord fredericks life was the result of the most violent and tender love  the little you know then mr dorriforth has deceived you had you known more you would have judged otherwise  i submit to the merit of your reply but without allowing me a judge at all i will appeal to those who were present with me  are mrs horton and mr sandford to be the connoisseurs  no i will appeal to miss fenton and miss woodley  and yet i believe replied she with a smile i believe theory must only be the judge even there  then from all you have said madam on this occasion i am to conclude you still refuse to marry lord frederick  you are  and you submit never to see him again  i do  all you then said to me yesterday was false  i was not mistress of myself at the time  therefore it was truth  for shame for shame  at that moment the door opened and mr sandford walked in  he started back on seeing miss milner and was going away again but dorriforth called to him to stay and said with warmth  tell me mr sandford by what power by what persuasion i can prevail upon this lady to confide in me as her friend to lay her heart open and credit mine when i declare to her i have no view in all the advice i give but her immediate welfare  mr dorriforth you know my opinion of the lady replied sandford it has been formed ever since my first acquaintance with her and it still remains the same  but instruct me how i am to inspire her with confidence returned dorriforth how i am to impress her with that which is for her advantage  you can work no miracles replied sandford you are not holy enough  and yet miss milner answered dorriforth appears to be acquainted with that mystery for what but the force of a miracle can induce her to contradict today what before you and several other witnesses she positively acknowledged yesterday  do you call that miraculous cried sandford the miracle had been if she had not done so  for did she not yesterday contradict what she acknowledged the day before  and will she not tomorrow disavow what she says today  i wish she may replied dorriforth mildly for he beheld the tears flowing down her face at the rough and severe manner in which sandford had spoken and began to feel for her uneasiness  i beg pardon cried sandford for speaking so rudely to the mistress of the house  i have no business here i know but where you are mr dorriforth unless i am turned out i shall ever think it my duty to come  miss milner courtesied as much as to say he was welcome to come  he continued  i was to blame that on a nice punctilio i left you so long without my visits and without my counsel in the time you have run the hazard of being murdered and what is worse of being excommunicated for had you been so rash as to have returned your opponents fire not all my interest at rome would have obtained remission of the punishment  miss milner through all her tears could not now restrain her laughter  on which he resumed  and here do i venture like a missionary among savages  but if i can only save you from the scalping knives of some of them from the miseries which that lady is preparing for you i am rewarded  sandford spoke this with great fervor and the crime of her love never appeared to miss milner in so tremendous a point of view as thus unknowingly alluded to by him   the miseries that lady is preparing for you hung upon her ears like the notes of a raven and equally ominous  the words  murder and  excommunication he had likewise uttered all the fatal effects of sacrilegious love  frightful superstitions struck to her heart and she could scarcely prevent falling down under their oppression  dorriforth beheld the difficulty she had in sustaining herself and went with the utmost tenderness and supported her saying i beg your pardon  i invited you hither with a far different view than your uneasiness   sandford was beginning to speak hold mr sandford resumed he the lady is under my protection and i know not whether it is not necessary you should apologize to her and to me for what you have already said  you asked my opinion or i had not given it you  would you have me like her speak what i do not think  say no more mr sandford cried dorriforth  and leading her kindly to the door as if to defend her from his malice told her he would take another opportunity to renew the subject  chapter xvii when dorriforth was alone with sandford he explained to him what before he had only hinted and this learned jesuit frankly confessed that the mind of a woman was far above or rather beneath his comprehension  it was so indeed  for with all his penetration and he had a great deal he had not yet penetrated into the recesses of miss milners heart  miss woodley to whom she repeated all that had passed between herself her guardian and sandford took this moment during the alarm and agitation of her spirits to alarm them still more by her prophetic insinuations and at length represented to her here for the first time the necessity that mr dorriforth and she should remain no longer under the same roof this was like the stroke of sudden death to miss milner and clinging to life she endeavored to avert the blow by prayers and by promises  her friend loved her too sincerely however to be prevailed upon  but in what manner can i bring about the separation cried she for till i marry we are obliged by my fathers request to live in the same house  miss milner answered miss woodley much as i respect the will of a dying man i regard your and mr dorriforths present and eternal happiness much more and it is my resolution you shall part  if you will not contrive the means that duty falls on me and without any invention i see the measure at once  what is it cried miss milner eagerly  to go and reveal to mr dorriforth without hesitation the real state of your heart which your present inconsistent conduct will but too readily confirm  you would not plunge me into so much shame into so much anguish cried she distractedly  no replied miss woodley not for the world provided you will separate from him by any method of your own  but that you shall separate is my determination and in spite of all your sufferings this shall be the means unless you instantly agree to some other  good heaven miss woodley is this your friendship  yes  and the truest friendship i have to bestow  think what a task i undertake for your sake and his when i condemn myself to explain to him your weakness  what astonishment what confusion what remorse do i foresee painted upon his face  i hear him call you by the harshest names and behold him fly from your sight for ever as an object of his detestation  oh spare the dreadful picture  fly from my sight for ever  detest my name oh my dear miss woodley let his friendship for me but still remain and i will consent to any thing  you may command me  i will go away from him directly  but let us part in friendship  oh without the friendship of mr dorriforth life would be a heavy burden indeed  miss woodley immediately began to plan schemes for their separation and with all her invention alive on the subject this was the only probable one she could form  miss milner was to write to her distant relation at bath complaining of the melancholy of a country life which she was to say her guardian imposed upon her and entreat the lady to send a pressing invitation for her to pass a month or two with her this invitation was to be shown to dorriforth for his approbation and both miss woodley and miss milner were to enforce it by expressing their earnest wishes for his consent this plan properly regulated the necessary letter was sent by miss milner to bath and miss woodley waited with patience but with a watchful guard upon the conduct of her friend till the answer arrived  during this interim a most tender and complaining epistle from lord frederick was delivered miss milner to which as he received no answer his lordship prevailed upon his uncle with whom he resided to wait upon her and obtain her verbal reply for he still flattered himself fear of her guardians anger or perhaps his interception of the letter he had sent was the cause of her seeming contempt  the old gentleman was introduced to miss milner and after to mr dorriforth but received from each an answer so explicit that left his nephew no longer in doubt but all farther pursuit was vain  sir edward ashton about this time also submitted to a formal dismission and had the mortification to reflect he was bestowing upon the object of his affections the tenderest proof of his regard by absenting himself wholly from her society  upon this serious and certain conclusion to the hopes of lord frederick dorriforth was more astonished than he had ever yet been at the conduct of his ward  he had once thought her behavior in respect to his lordship was ambiguous but since her confession of a passion for him he had no doubt but that in the end she would become his wife  he lamented to find himself mistaken and now thought it proper to give some important marks of his condemnation of her pernicious caprice and not merely in words but by the general tenor of his behavior he consequently became much more reserved and more austere than he had been since his first acquaintance with her for his manners not from design but unknowingly were softened since his guardianship by that render respect he had never ceased to pay to the object of his protection  notwithstanding this severity he assumed his ward in the prospect of parting from him grew melancholy miss woodleys love to her friend rendered her little otherwise and dorriforths peculiar gravity oftentimes rigor could not but make the whole party much less cheerful than they had been lord elmwood too was lying dangerously ill of a fever miss fenton of course was as much in sorrow as her nature would suffer her to be and both sandford and dorriforth in extreme concern on his lordships account  in this state of affairs the letter of invitation arrives from lady luneham at bath it was shown to dorriforth and to prove to his ward he is so much offended as no longer to feel that excessive interest in her concerns he once did he gives his opinion on the subject with indifference  he desires miss milner will do as she herself thinks proper  miss woodley instantly accepts this permission writes back and appoints the day her friend means to set off for the visit  she is wounded to the heart by the cold and unkind manners of her guardian but dares not take one method to retrieve his opinion  alone and to miss woodley she sighs and weeps he discovers her sorrow and is doubtful whether the departure of lord frederick from that part of the country is not the cause  when the day on which she was to set off for bath was within two days distance only the behavior of dorriforth took by degrees its usual form if not a greater share of polite and tender attention than ever  it was the first time he had parted from miss milner since he became her guardian and he felt upon the occasion a reluctance  he had been angry with her he had shown her he was so and he now began to wish he had not  she is not happy he considered within himself every word and action declares she is not and i may have been too severe and added to her uneasiness  at least we will part on good terms  said he  indeed my regard for her is such i cannot part otherwise  she soon discerned his returning kindness and it was a gentle tie that would have fastened her to the spot where she was but for the firm resistance of miss woodley  what will a few months absence effect cried she pleading her cause at the end of a few months at farthest he will expect me back and where will be the merit in this shortseparation  in that time replied miss woodley we may find some method to make it still longer  to this she listened with a kind of despair but uttered she was resigned and accordingly prepared for her departure  dorriforth was all anxiety that every circumstance of her journey should be commodious he was eager she should be happy and he was eager she should see he entirely forgave her  he would have gone part of the way with her but for the extreme illness of lord elmwood in whose chamber he passed chief of the day and slept in elmwood house every night  on the morning of her journey when dorriforth gave his hand and conducted miss milner to the carriage all
