a fourth discourse on the miracles of our savior  in view of the present controversy between infidels and apostates  canes qui oblatrant contra inquisitionem veritatis clem alex by thomas woolston sometime fellow of sidneycollege in cambridge  london printed for the author and sold by him next door below the star in aldermanbury and by the booksellers of london and westminster      price one shilling  to the right reverend father in god francis lord bishop of st asaph my lord if the convocation had been sitting i would have made this dedication to them and humbly implored of them what for their love to the fathers they would readily have granted a recommendation of these my discourses on miracles to the clergy but being unhappily disappointed of a session of that reverend and learned body for whose wise debates and orthodox votes i have such a veneration as is not to be expressed in a few words i presently turned my thoughts on your lordship to whom a dedication is due because of your respect often declared for the authority of the fathers which induces me to think you now approve of the use i have made of them  but what i am here to applaud your lordship for is your discourse called difficulties and discouragements etc that admirable satire against modern orthodoxy and persecution how was i tickled in the perusal of it it is plainly the sense of your soul or you had set your name to it and if the temptation of praise for it had not been too great to be resisted i could have wished you had always concealed your self and then you had not written against the grain an awkward piece on church power like a retractation to reingratiate your self with some ecclesiastical noodles whom you no more than i need to care for  i have sometimes wondered my lord where and when the great mr grounds imbibed his notable notions about religion and liberty for he sucked them not in with his mothers milk who i suppose trained him up in the belief of christianity but when i considered that he was once the pupil of mr hare at cambridge my wonder ceased under your lordships tuition it seems he laid the foundation of his distinguished learning and opinions his pupillage will be your immortal honor i wonder none of the writers against him have as yet celebrated your praise for it how does he imitate and resemble his tutor in principles i cannot say he surpasses you since there is such a freedom of thought and expression in your difficulties etc so strongly savouring of infidty that he has not as yet equaled  upon your lordships advancement to a bishopric difficultys and discouragements not withstanding i wished without prescribing to the wisdom of the government in the choice of a learned prelate that the great mr grounds for the good of the church too might be soon consecrated and i should not have despaired of it but that he is a gentleman of real probity and conscience and might possibly boggle at subscriptions unless you and bishop hoadly could help him to some of your reserves and distinctions wherewith you must be both well stocked to overcome that difficulty and why should not dean swift for his writings as well as some others be made a bishop i should like to see him one if the then right reverend bishop grounds would not think him for his tale of a tub too loose in the faith for his company  dont imagine my lord that i am forming of schemes for my self to be a bishop tho these my discourses on miracles are of very great merit as well as your lordships difficulties etc yet you may be assured i have no such view when i tell you that the honor the fathers have exalted me to of a moderator in this controversy sets me above all ecclesiastical preferment excepting the archbishopric of canterbury which i am afraid will be void before the king is apprised of my singular worth and qualifications for it  but however if such excellent prelates as grounds hoadly swift hare and my self were at the head of ecclesiastical affairs what would we do what should we not do what would not this freethinking age expect from us nothing less than that according to our principles we should endeavor to set mankind at perfect liberty and to lay open the dirty fences of the church called subscriptions which are not only the stain of a good conscience but the discouragements your lordship hints at in the study of the scriptures and if we made a push for an act of pt to turn the clergy to grass after king henry viiiths monks and friars where would be the harm of it nay the advantage to the public as well as to religion would be great if their revenues were applied to the payment of national debts with a reserve to our selves remember my lord of large emoluments out of them according to our great merits otherwise worldlywise men will repute us impolitick fools which you and bishop hoadly i humbly presume will never endure the reproach of  so hoping your lordship will accept of this dedication to your praise in as much sincerity as it is written i subscribe myself  my lord the admirer of your difficultys and discouragements tho woolston london may         a fourth discourse on the miracles of our savior etc now for a fourth discourse on jesuss miracles which as before i begin with a repetition of the three general heads at first proposed to be treated on and they are  i to show that the miracles of healing all manner of bodily diseases which jesus was famed for are none of the proper miracles of the messiah neither are they so much as a good proof of his divine authority to found a religion  ii to prove that the literal history of many of the miracles of jesus as recorded by the evangelists does imply absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities consequently they either in the whole or in part were never wrought as it is commonly believed nowadays but are only related as prophetical and parabolical narratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  iii to consider what jesus means when he appeals to his miracles as to a testimony and witness of his divine power and to show that he could not properly and ultimately refer to those he then wrought in the flesh but to the mystical ones he would do in the spirit of which those wrought in the flesh are but mere types and shadows  i am upon the second of these heads and according to it have in my former discourses taken into examination eight of the miracles of jesus viz those    of his driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple    of his exorcising the devils out of the madmen and sending them into the herd of swine    of his transfiguration on the mount    of his healing a woman that had an issue of blood twelve years    of his curing a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years    of his telling the samaritan woman her fortune of having had five husbands and being then an adulteress with another man    of his cursing the fig tree for not bearing fruit out of season and    of his healing a man of an infirmity at the pool of bethesda  whether it be not manifest that the literal and evangelical story of these miracles from what i have argued and reasoned upon them does not consist of absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities according to the proposition before us let my readers judge and so i come to the consideration of    a ninth miracle of jesus viz that john ix of his giving sight to a man who was born blind by the means of eye salve made of dirt and spittle  blindness as far as one may guess by the evangelical history was the distemper that jesus frequently exercised his power on and there is no doubt to be made but he healed many of one weakness defect and imperfection or other in their eyes but whether he wrought any miracle upon any he is supposed to have cured is uncertain there are as it is notorious many kinds of blindness that are incurable by art or nature and there are other kinds of it that nature and art will relieve a man in but whether jesus used his healing power against the former as well as the latter sort of blindness is more than can be affirmed or at least proved by our divines and unless we knew of a certainty that the sore or blind eyes jesus cured were absolutely out of the reach of art and nature infidels will imagine and suggest that he was only master of a good ointment for sore eyes and being successful in the use of it ignorant people would needs think he wrought miracles  the world is often blessed with excellent oculists who through study and practice have attained to wonderful skill in eyemaladies which tho they are of various sorts yet by custom of speech all pass under the general name of blindness and sometimes we hear of famous chancedoctors like jesus who by a gift of god nature or fortune without any skill in the structure of the eyes have been very successful in the cure of one distemper or other incident to them such was sir william read who tho no scholar nor of acquired abilities in physic and surgery yet cured his thousands of sore or blind eyes and many of them too to the surprise and astonishment of professed surgeons and physicians whether he or jesus cured the greater number of blindness may be questioned to please our divines it shall be granted that jesus cured the greater numbers but that he cured worse or more difficult distempers in the eyes cannot be proved sir william indeed met with many cases of blind and sore eyes that were out of the reach of his power and so did jesus too or he had never let great multitudes of the blind and otherwise distempered people go unheald by him our divines will here say that it was never want of power in jesus but want of faith in the diseased if he did not heal them but in other surgeons and physicians it is confessedly their own insufficiency to which i have only this answer that our physicians and surgeons are to be commended for their ingenuity to impute it to their own defect of power and not to lay the blame upon their patients when they cannot cure them and it is lucky for us christians that we have this salvo for the credit of jesuss miraculously healing power that it was not fit he should exert it against unbelief otherwise reasonably speaking he with sir william read greatrex vespasian our former kings of england and seventhsons must have passed but for a chancedoctor  but to come to the particular consideration of the miracle before us jesus restored it seems a blind man to his eyesight by the use of a peculiar ointment and washing of his eyes as directed in the pool of siloam where lies the miracle i cannot see it but hope our divines will take their opportunity to point it out to me our surgeons with their ointments and washings can cure sore and blind eyes of one sort or other and jesus did no more here and yet he must be reckoned a worker of miracles and they but artificial operators where is the sense and reason of this difference between them if mr moor the apothecary for the notable cures he performs by the means of his medicines should write himself and be accounted by his admirers a miracleworker he and they would be but laughed at for it and yet jesus for his curing the sore eyes of a poor man with an ointment must be had in veneration for a divine and miraculous operator as much as if by the breath of his mouth he had removed an huge mountain  a miracle if i mistake not the notion of our divines about it is a supernatural event or a work out of the power of nature or art to effect and when it is spoken of the cure of a disease as of blindness or lameness it ought to be so represented as that skilful and experienced surgeons and physicians who can do strange and surprising cures by art may give it upon their judgment that no skill of man could reach that operation but that it ought to pass for the work of a divine and almighty hand and power but there is no such care taken in the description of any of the diseases which jesus cured much less of this before us against the miraculousness of which consequently there are these two exceptions to be made  first that we know nothing of the nature of this poor mans blindness nor what was the defect of his eyes nor whether it was curable by art or not without which knowledge it is impossible and unreasonable to assert that there was a miracle wrought in the cure of him if his blindness or weakness of eyesight was curable by human means and jesus did use those means there is an end of the miracle if the evangelist had given us an accurate description of the condition of this mans eyes before cure we could have judged better but this is their constant neglect in all the distempers jesus healed and is enough to induce us to doubt of his miraculous power there are as i have said some sorts of sore or blind eyes curable by art as experience does testify and there are others incurable as physicians and patients do lament of which sort this mans was we know not the worst that we know of his case is that he was blind from his birth or infancy which might be and yet time nature and art may give relief to him as a man advances in years the diseases of childhood and youth wear off what we call the kings evil or an inflammation in the eyes in time will abate of its malignity nature will not only by degrees work the cure itself but the seasonable help of a good oculist will soon expedite it tho in time of infancy he could be of no use and who knows but this might be the case of this blind man whose cure jesus by his art did only hasten and help forward however there are grounds enough to suspect that it was not divine power which healed this man or jesus had never prepared and ordered an ointment and wash for him  should our divines suppose or describe for the evangelist a state of blindness in this man incurable by art that would be begging the question which no unbeliever will grant but to please them i will yield without enquiry into the nature of this mans blindness that if jesus had used no medicines if with only a word of his mouth he had cured the man and he had instantaneously recovered as the word was spoken here would have been a real and great miracle let the blindness or imperfection of the mans sight before be of what kind or degree soever but jesuss use of washings and ointments absolutely spoils and destroys the credit of the miracle and we ought by no means to ascribe that to the immediate hand and power of god which medicines and balsams are applied to the effect of and this brings me to the  second exception against the miraculousness of the cure of this blind man which is that jesus used human means for the cure of him which means whether they were at all proper and effectual in themselves do affect the credit of the miracle and give occasion of suspicion that it was art and not divine power that healed him or jesus for his honor had never had recourse to the use of them and what were those means or that medicine which jesus made use of why he spit upon the ground and made a balsam of dirt and spittle and anointed the poor mans eyes with it and he recovered a strange and odd sort of an ointment that i believe was never used before nor since for sore and blind eyes i am not student enough in physic and surgery to account for the natural and rational use of this balsam but wish that skilful professors of those sciences would help me out at this difficulty if they could rationally account for the use of this eye salve tho it was by supposing that jesus imperceptibly had in his mouth a proper unctuous and balsamic substance which he dissolved into spittle they would do great service to a certain cause and i wonder none of them whether well or ill affected to religion have as yet bent their thoughts to it  in the practice of physic and surgery there are sometimes very odd and unaccountable medicaments made use of and nowandthen very whimsical and seemingly ridiculous ones by old women to good purpose but none of them are to be compared to jesuss balsam for sore eyes i have heard of a merry mountebank of distinction whose catholic medicine was hastypudding which indeed is a notable remedy against the esuriency of the stomach that the poor often labor under but jesuss eye salve for absurdity whim and incongruity was never equaled either in jest or in earnest by any quackdoctor whether infidels think of this ointment of the holy jesus with a smile or reflect on it with disdain i cannot guess as to myself i should think with st chrysostom quid lutum illinere oportet hoc potius caecum reddere quis unquam hoc pacto curatus est in loc johan  that this eye salve of jesus would sooner put a mans eyes out than restore a blind one to his sight and i believe that our divines for the credit of the miracle and our surgeons for the honor of their science will agree that it could not be naturally operative and effective of the cure of the blind man  what then was the reason of jesuss using this strange eye salve when for the sake of the miracle and for the honor of his own power he should have cured the man with a word speaking this is a question and objection in st cyril quam ob causam dicet aliquis cum omnia solo verbo praestare possit nulloque negotio lutum quidem sputo macerat in loc johan against ministers of the letter who are obliged to give an answer to it that will consist with the wisdom and power of jesus otherwise they must give up the miracle or make him a vain insignificant and trifling agent st cyril of whose mind i am says sed rationem quandam mysticam habet vis rei istius de sputo ibid that the reason of the use of this balsam made of dirt and spittle is to be fetched from the mystery but in as much as our divines will never agree to that which would be of ill consequence to their ministry they must give a good reason of their own which i despair of seeing that will comport with the letter  st irenaeus too says ei autem qui caecus fuerat a nativitate jam non per sermonem sed per operationem praestitit visum non vane neque prout evenit hoc faciens sed ut osteneret manum dei eam quae ab initio plasmavit hominem etc contra haeres l v c     that the clay and spittle was of no service to the cure of the blind man and yet jesus did not use it in vain is not this an inconsistency how will our divines adjust it with irenaeus i am sure they will not mystically solve the difficulty therefore if they dont provide another solntion of it to satisfaction either their ministry of the letter or the reputation of jesus and this miracle must suffer for it  i am puzzled to think how our divines will extricate themselves out of this strait and account for the use of this eyeslave without any diminution of the miracle surely they will not say that jesus used this senseless and insignificant ointment to put a slur upon the practice of physic and surgery as if other medicines were of no more avail than his dirt and spittle they have more wit than to say so least it incense a noble and most useful profession not so much against themselves as against jesus and provoke them to a nicer and stricter enquiry than i can make into his miracles the diseases he cured and his manner of operation and to infer from thence that he could be no miraculous healer of diseases who used medicines nor his evangelists orthodox at theology who were so inexpert at anatomy and the description of bodily distempers this might be of bad consequence to religion and yet i wonder that none of them who may be supposed a little disaffected to christianity have taken the hint from this pretended miracle before us and some others to endeavor at a proof of jesuss being little better than a quackdoctor  if i was what i am not an infidel i should think from the letter of this story that jesus was a juggling impostor who would pass for a miraculous healer of diseases tho he used underhand proper medicines the clay and the spittle he made an open show of as what to admiration he would cure the blind man with but in reserve he had a more sanative balsam that he subtly slipt in the room of the clay and repeatedly to good purpose anointed the mans eyes with it but as the authority of the fathers and their mystical interpretation of this story is alone my safeguard against such an ill opinion of jesus so i would now gladly know upon what bottom the faith of our divines can stand as to this miracle and jesuss divine power in it  i have perused some of our commentators on the place and dont perceive that they hesitate at this strange eye salve nor make any questions about the pertinent or impertinent use of it whether it is that they sleep over the story or are aware of greater difficultys in it than can be easily surmounted and therefore dare not touch on it i know not but now that we enjoy liberty of debate which will make us philosophers and i have taken the freedom to make a stricter scrutiny than ordinary into jesuss miracles and to consider what absurditys their storys and this in particular are clogged with it is incumbent on our divines to answer solidly these questions viz what was the reason of jesuss use of this eye salve made of clay and spittle whether if it was of service to the cure of the blind man it does not destroy the miracle and if it had no effect in the cure of him whether jesus was not a vain and trifling operator making use of insignificant and impertinent medicines to the diminution of his divine power these questions are not ludicrous but calm and sedate reasoning which bishop smalbroke see his sermon before the societys for reformation p    does not disapprove of therefore a grave rational and substantial answer is expected to them such as will be a vindication of the wisdom and power of jesus without any diminution of the miracle  should our divines say that this matter was an act of unsearchable wisdom and must be left to the will of our savior and not curiously pried into any more than some other dispensations of providence that are past finding out this answer which i believe to be the best that can be given will not do here the miracles of jesus are as our divines own appeals to our reason and senses for his authority and by our reason and senses they are to be tried condemned or approved of if they will not abide the test of reason and sense they are to be rejected and jesuss authority along with them therefore a more close pertinent and serious answer is to be given to the said questions which as i believe to be impossible consistently with the letter so our divines must of necessity go along with me to the fathers for a mystical and allegorical interpretation of the story of this eye salve or the miracle will fall to the ground and jesuss divine power be in great danger with it  st cyril who is one of bishop smalbrokes greek commentators that should strictly adhere to the letter signifies as i before observed that jesuss use of this clay and spittle would be an absurdity if it was not to be accounted for from the mystery  eusebius gallicanus treating on this miracle says ipse salvator noster apertissime ostendit quod ejus miracula aliquid significent dum ea faciendo alivuid agit quod ratione carere videatur nisi enim aliquid significaret quid necessarium fuit in hujus caeci illuminatione ut lutum faceret quo oculos ejus liniret cui solum dicere sufficiens erat quaeramus igitur significationem and videams quid caecus iste significet in homil quarta post quart dominicam  that our savior apparently manifests that his miracles are of a spiritual and mystical signification because in the work of them he does somewhat or other that literally has no sense nor reason in it as for instance in the cure of this blind man what occassion was there for clay and spittle to anoint his eyes if it was not of a mystical meaning when with a word of his mouth jesus could have cured him let us then set aside the letter of the story and search for the mystery and consider who is meant by this blind man etc  origin too upon occasion of this miracle and its absurdity according to the letter says similitudo erat and typus futurorum unumquodque quod fiebat in corpore veluti nescio quis a nativitate caecus visum recuperavit vere autem caecus iste erat a nativitate gentilium populus cui salvator reddidit vi saliva sua ungens oculos ejus and mittens ad siloam quod interpretatur missus mittebat quippe illos quos spiritu unxit ad apostolos in isai c vi  that whatever jesus did in the flesh was but a type and figure of what he would do in spirit as is apparent from the miracle of his curing a blind man which nobody knows why it was so done if it be not to be understood of a mystical ointment to open the eyes of the blind in understanding  and who then is this blind man mystically st augustine genus humanum est iste caecus in loc johan  st jerome caecus humanum genus significatur in com johan  eusebius gallicanus caecus iste a nativitate genus humanum esse videtur a primo homine  haec enim caecitas non corporis sed animae est in loc supra laudat st theophilus of antioch per caecum naturaliter non videntem and illuminaeeum significat genus humanum in loc johan  origin vere autem caecus iste erat a nativitate gentilium populus in isai c vi  st cyril of alexandria caeci hujus curationem in figuram and typum vocationis gentium accepimus in loc johan  and st theophylact intellige hoc miraculum spiritualiter nam caecus quidem erat omnis homo a nativitate id est ab initio mundi in loc johan  four of them bishop smalbrokes greek and literal commentators say this blind man is a type of mankind of all nations who in the perfection of time signified by the sabbath in sabbato est figura ultimi temporis st cyril in loc johan in the story is to be cured of this blindness in understanding  and what is mankinds blindness here signified st augustine caecitas est infidelitas in loc  st cyril caecus qui destituitur divino lumine de adorat p     and st thyophylact caecus qui sedet in tenebris omnis ignoranti and non potuit videre conditorem mundi in loc johan  say it is ignorance error and infidelity or the want of the intellectual sight and knowledge of god and his providence origin literam legis sequentes in errores superstitiones and infidelitatem incurrunt in matt tract xxvi  st john of jerusalem caecus iste est caecus in litera and hoc statu saari non potest in marc c viii  and st theophylact caeci qui imperiti scripturarum in loc johan  still bishop smalbrokes literal and greek commentators tell us the reason of this spiritual blindness of mankind and that is because they adhere to the letter of the scriptures  and how will jesus or right reason and truth which are his mystical names cure mankind of this his spiritual blindness by his mystical spittle tempered with mystical dirt and how shall we do to understand this mystical ointment so as to make it a proper medicine for mankinds spiritual blindness st theophilus of antioch lutum vero factum de saliva oris domini ac positum super oculos caeci significat hic quod naturae rat opere suo implere figulum in loc johan  has an allegorical interpretation of this clay and spittle of our lord but as it is hard to apprehend his meaning i shall not here insist on it origin says saliva sua ungens oculos caeci and mittens ad am quod interpretatur missus mittebat quippe illos quos spiritu unxit etc in isai c vi  that the anointing of the blind mans eyes with spittle is to be understood of the unction of the spirit of christ but this does not give us rightly to understand the metaphor and figure st john of jerusalem says that by the clay and spittle is meant saliva est perfecta doctrina in marc c viii perfect doctrine which in truth may open the eyes of mens understanding but what is perfect doctrine why to help the fathers out here without departing from their opinions by the spittle of jesus must be understood the water of the spirit instilled into the earth of the letter of the scriptures which tempered together does in the judgment of them all make perfect doctrine to the opening of the eyes of our understanding in the knowledge of the providence of god of all ages which knowledge light sight or illumination mankind has hitherto wanted  st irenaeus ei autem qui caecus fuerat a nativitate jam non per sermonem sed per operationem praestitit visum non vane neque prout evenit hoc faciens sed ut ostenderet manum dei eam que ab initio plasmavit hominem quapropter expuit in terram and fecit lutum and superlinivit illud oculis ostendens antiquam plasmationem quemadmodum facta est and manum dei manifestans his qui intelligere possunt per quam e limo plasmatus est homo cont hareses l v c     gives an excellent and mystical reason by himself for the use of this ointment of clay and spittle to the cure of this blind man which i shall not stay to illustrate but only have cited it for the meditation of the learned and curious  the story of the blind man as st john has related it is long and would take up more time than i have to spare at present to go through all the parts of it what i have done at present is enough to awaken others to the consideration not only of the absurdities of the letter but of the mystical interpretation of the rest  the miracle which consisted literally in the cure of a blind man by the use of an ointment made of dirt and spittle is absurd senseless and unaccountable but in the mystery there is wisdom and reason and the cure of mankind of the blindness of his understanding by the spirits being tempered with the letter of the scriptures which is the mystical eye salve will not only be a most stupendous miracle but a proof of jesuss messiahship beyond all contradiction in as much as by such an opening of the eyes of our understandings which have been hitherto dark we shall see how he is the accomplishment of the law and the prophets and so i pass to a  0 tenth miracle of jesus viz john ii that of his turning water into wine at a marriage in cana of galilee this is called the beginning of jesuss miracles but whether it is to be understood of the first of his whole life or of the first that he wrought in cana of galilee is not agreed amongst divines i shall not enter into the dispute which as it is of no consequence to my cause in hand so i shall pass it by and not urge any arguments for or against either side of it  tho i would not for the world be so impious and profane as to believe what is contained and implied in the letter of this story yet i am still too grave to handle it as ludicrously as i ought and it is now against the grain that i write so freely as i shall against it being unwilling not only to put the clergy out of all temper but to give scoffers and infidels so great an advantage against their ministry of the letter some may wonder that i who have gone so far in the ludicrous display of the gross absurdities of some other miracles should boggle at this but to be ingenuous and speak the truth sincerely i am still a christian for all what the bishop of st davids see his speech in convocation printed in the postboy of march the  0th archdeacon stubbs and others would make of me upon the principles of the fathers and have a greater veneration for the person of the holy jesus than to be forward to make such sport with him his mother and his disciples as this story affords scope for and if it was not for the necessity of turning the clergys heads to the consideration of mysterys this miracle should have been passed by in silence  there were some anciently whom st chrysostom rursus hoc in loco calumniantur nonnulli hunc ebriosorum fuisse conventum etc in loc johan writes of whether jews gentiles or heretics i know not who took great offense at the story of this wedding accounting it from what is related in st john as a riotous feast and that jesus and his mother and his disciples not only bore a part in the revellings but were most to blame for them or he should not have countenanced them with his presence much less promoted them by the change of a large quantity of water into wine for the use of a company who were already drunk with it but i with st chrysostom am inclined to believe that if jesus did grace this wedding with his presence there was no excess encouraged or so much as suffered at it if he did accept of the invitation of the bridegroom it was for an opportunity not so much to turn water into wine as to make a proper discourse to the people of conjugal duties and as he was a searcher of the hearts secretly to admonish the married of the sin and mischief of adultery tho we read not of a seasonable and good word spoken at it  and the empress eudocia a nursing mother of the church has given us a poetical and i hope a fictitious description of this wedding she makes a sumptuous and voluptuous feast of it and writes pueri aut saltatores volutabantur in his autem tibiae lyraeque vocem habebant mulieres autem cantum accipientes volvebantur per medias quaecunque optimatum erant uxores atque filiae ill vero ad saltationem and desiderabilem cantum conversi delectabantur etc in homerocenton empress of music and dancing in abundance enough to make us think of such mirth and pastime here as was unbecoming of a company of saints to be present at whether it was that this empress being only accustomed to the excesses of a court could form no meaner conceptions of a country wedding or whether she had any extrascriptural authority for what she writ i know not but i believe that if jesus was at all at a marriage feast the whole was conducted with decency order and sobriety and if he there wrought any miracle it was to manifest his glory to the conversion of some and confirmation of the faith of others  and our translators of the bible too have given occasion to suspect somewhat of excess at this wedding or they need not have made the waterpots to hold two or three firkins apiece if i had been the translator they should not have held above two or three pints apiece which measure is as agreeable to the original as firkin neither can i imagine that jesus if he did convert water into wine would do it in so large a measure for fear of an intemperate abuse of it but only gave the company a cast of his miraculous power and a little taste of his love and goodwill to them  such are the conceptions that to the honor of jesus i am willing to form of this wedding and wish that the letter of the story did suggest no worse thoughts of it to us i should be pleased if no infidel really could what i but for the sake of the mystery most unwillingly should write any ludicrous descants on it but if this story had been related of apollonius tyanaeus as it is of our jesus i would have ridiculed and satirizd it to the utmost of my power and have rendered him and his disciples of all nations as contemptible as i could for the belief of it and i dont doubt but our christian priests would have given me ample praises and commendations for so doing it is said of apollonius that for the entertainment of his friends he commanded variety of nice dishes of meat together with bowls of choicest wine all on a sudden to descend upon his table and range themselves in good order whether there was any truth in this miracle of apollonius is not the question but mr chandler vindication of the christian religion p    could see a fault in it tho none in jesuss wine at this wedding as if it was done for the pleasure of luxurious appetites tho we read of no intemperance at it which cannot be said of the weddingfeast before us our divines i suppose no more than myself believe any thing of the said miracle in apollonius but if it was really wrought i fancy i could have lampoond him for it and would have made it a diabolical work like that as fables go of the feastings of wizards and witches and our divines passing by jesuss wine here would readily as they are believers of the storys of witchcraft have struck in with me  but setting aside that miraculous story of apollonius which has but one voucher the case before us is jesuss turning water into wine for the use of men who had before well drank how shall i force nature and faith to ridicule this story how shall i lay aside that profound veneration for the holy jesus which conversation with the fathers more than the prejudice of education has begotten in me and ludicrously here treat him and his miracle too as is incumbent upon me to make way for the mystery in short i cannot do it in my own name but having met with a satirical invective of a supposed jewish rabbi to this purpose i here publish it that our clergy as well as myself may think of an answer to it and so prevent that mischief it may do by being handed about among jews and infidels in manuscript it is as follows  you christians pay adoration to jesus whom you believe to be a divine author of religion sent of god for the instruction reformation and salvation of mankind and what induces you to this belief of him is besides some obscure prophecies which you cannot agree upon and which neither your selves nor any body else understands the application of the history of his miracles but i wonder you should have a good opinion of him for his miracles which if he wrought no better than what are recorded of him by your evangelists are if duly considered enough to alienate your hearts from him i cannot spare time now to examine into all of them but according to the cursory observation i have made on them there is not one so well circumstanced as to merit a considerate mans belief that it was the work of an omnipotent allwise just and good agent some of them are absurd tales others foolish facts others unjust actions others ludicrous pranks others juggling tricks others magical enchantments and if many of them had been better and greater operations than they are and of a more useful and stupendous nature than they seem to be yet the first miracle that he wrought viz that of his turning water into wine at an extravagant and voluptuous wedding at cana of galilee is enough to turn our stomachs against all the rest it is in itself enough to beget in us an ill opinion of jesus and to prepossess us with an aversion to his religion without farther examination into it it is enough to make us suspect his other miracles of what name soever to be of a base magical and diabolical extraction or he had never set up for a divine worker of miracles with so ill a grace would any sober grave serious and divine person as you christians suppose jesus to have been have vouchsafed his presence at a wedding where such levities diversions and excesses in our nation of the jews as well as in all others were indulged on such occasions as were not fit to be seen much less countenanced by the saint you would make of him if your jesus his mother and his disciples had not been merry folks in themselves they would have declined the invitation of the bridegroom nay if they had been at all graver and more serious people than ordinary no invitation had been given to such spoilsports but boon companions they were and of comimical conversation or there had been at a wedding no room for them you christians may fancy what you please of jesus and his mothers saintship but the very text of the story implies they were lovers of good fellowship and excess too upon occasion or he had never upon her intimation turned so large a quantity of water into wine after all or most of the company were far gone with it you may suppose if you please that all were sober and none intoxicated and that the want of wine proceeded from the abundance of company rather than excess in drinking but why then did john the evangelist use the word  which implies they were more than half seas over and if jesus and his mother had not both a mind to top them up the one would not have requested nor the other have granted a miracle to that purpose whether jesus and his mother themselves were at all cut as were others of the company is not so certain she might be an abstemious dame for ought we know tho if old stories are true of her familiarity with a soldier of whom came her chara deum soboles in all probability she would take a dram and a bottle too but it looks as if jesus himself was a little in for it or he had never spoke so waspishly and snappishly to his mother saying woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come which was very unbecoming of a dutiful son who excepting when he ran away from his parents and put them to luke ii    sorrow and trouble to look him up was and is still in heaven say the roman catholics a most obedient child you modern christians may put what construction you can upon the words above of jesus to his mother to salve his credit but the fathers of your church christus asperius respondit quid tibi and mihi mulier st chrysostom in loc johan vide and theophylact in loc confess them to be a sharp and surly reply to her which if it did not proceed from the natural badness0 of his temper derived ex traduce from his supposed father yet was certainly the effect of drinking and that is the more likely because it is a broken and witless sentence such as fuddlecaps utter by halves when the wines in and the wits out your modern commentators are sadly puzzled to make good sense of this broken and abrupt sentence of jesus and a pertinent reply of it to what his mother said to him they have no wine if you will bear with me i will help you out at this dead lift and give you the true meaning of it thus jesuss mother being apprised of a deficiency of wine and willing as well as the bridegroom that the company should be thoroughly merry before they parted intimates to her son whom she knew to be initiated in the mysterys of bacchus that they had no wine but before she could finish her request to him he mistaking her meaning imagines she was cautioning against drinking more wine and exhorting him to go home whereupon he takes her up short and quick saying woman what have you to do with me for that too is the english of the greek i will not be interrupted in my cups nor break company for mine hour is not yet come to depart but after he rightly apprehended her he goes to work and rather than the company should want their fill by trick of art like a punchmaker meliorates water into what they called wine that this is the obvious interpretation and natural paraphrase of the words before us shall be tried by the absurd comments nowadays put upon them that are enough to make a considerate man laugh if not hiss at them  some ancient heretics vide sanctum augustinum in loc johan  very gravely inferred from this expression woman what have i to do with thee that mary was neither a virgin nor jesus her son or he had never accosted her with such blunt language that implys they could not be so akin to each other this was a perplexity to st augustine and gave him some trouble to explain the expression consistently with her virginity for all she cohabited with the old carpenter and his filiation but this being a quibble that has been long since dropped i shall not revive nor insist on it but that the expression above does suppose a little inebriation in jesus i may averr neither is there a better solution to be made of it  the fathers of your church being sensible of the absurdity abruptness impertinence pertness and senslesness of the passage before us according to the letter had recourse to a mystical and allegorical interpretation as the only way to make it consistent with the wisdom sobriety and duty of the holy jesus but you moderns abandoning allegories and mysteries in miracles have endeavored i say to put other constructions upon it as may comport with the letter and credit of jesus but how insipid and senseless they are i appeal to a reasonable man who will give himself the trouble to consult them upon the place and save me the pains of a tedious and nauseous work to recount them for him  but to humor the christian priesthood at this day i will suppose that jesus and his mother and disciples tho fishermen to have been all sober grave and serious at this wedding suitably to the opinion that their followers now would have us to entertain of them but then it is hard to conceive them less than spectators and even encouragers of excess and intemperance in others or jesus after their more than sufficient drinking for the satisfaction of nature had never turned water into wine nor would his mother have requested him to do it if i say they had not a mind and took pleasure in it too to see the company quite stitched up  a sober prudent and wise philosopher or magician in the place of jesus if he had an art or power to turn water into wine would never have exercised it upon such an occasion no not to please his best friends nor in obedience to the most indulgent parent what would he have said in such a case that the company had drank sufficiently already and there was no need of more wine the bridegroom had kindly and plentifully entertained his guests and he would not for the honor of god who had endowed him with a divine power be at the expense of a miracle to promote the least intemperance whether such a speech and resolution in jesus upon this occasion would not have been more commendable than what he did let any one judge  if i was a christian i would for the honor of jesus renounce this miracle and not magnify and extol it as a divine and good act as many nowadays do i would give into and contend for the truth of that gloss which the gentiles of old apud st chrysostomum in loc johan by way of objection put upon it viz that the company having exhausted the bridegrooms stock of wine and being in expectation of more jesus rather than the bridegroom should be put to the blush for deficiency palmd a false miracle by the help of the governor of the feast upon a drunken crew that is having some spirituous liquors at hand mingled them with a quantity of water which the governor of the feast vouched to be incomparable good wine miraculously made by jesus and the company being through a vitiated palate incapable of distinguishing better from worse and of discovering the fraud admired the wine and the miracle and applauded jesus for it and perhaps became his disciples upon it if i i say was a disciple of jesus i would give this story such an old turn for his credit and i appeal to indifferent judges whether such a daubing of the miracle to remove the offense of infidels at this day would not be politically and wisely done of me whether modern christians may be brought into such a notion of this supposed miracle i know not but really there is room enough to suspect such a fraud in it  but supposing jesuss change of water into wine to have been a real miracle none commissioned of god for the reformation and instruction of mankind would ever have done it here miracles as mr chandler vindication of the christian religion p    says excellently well must be such things as that it is consistent with the perfections of god to interest himself in and again they must argue not only the power of god but his love to mankind and his inclination to do them good which this of jesus is so far from that it has an an evil aspect and tendency as is above represented consequently it is to be rejected and no longer esteemed a divine miracle neither is jesus to be received as a revealer of gods will for it as mr chandler will bear me witness  no doubt on it but you christian priests would have us jews and infidels to believe the whole company at this wedding for all what is intimated by st john to the contrary to consist of sober and demure saints i will suppose so but then what occasion had they at all for wine what reason could there be for gods power to interpose and make it especially in so large a quantity for them i can conceive none if any of the company had been taken with fainting fits and jesus for want of a cordial bottle had created a chearing dram or two i could not have found fault with it tho even here if he had restored the patient with a word of his mouth it had been a better miracle than making of wine for him but that he should make for a company of sots a large quantity of wine of no less than twelve or eighteen firkins of english measure enough to intoxicate the whole town of cana of galilee is what can never be accounted for by a christian who should one would think wish this story for the reputation of jesus expunged out of the new testament  besides if jesus had really and miraculously made wine which no power or art of man could do he should to prevent all suspicion of deceit in the miracle have done it without the use of water you christians say he is the original cause of all things out of nothing why then did he not sed quanam gratia antequam implerentur non fecit miraculum quod long fuisset admirabilius siquidem aliud est subjectae materiae qualitatem mutare aliud ipsam substantiam ex nihilo facere chrysos in loc create this wine out of nothing why did he not order the pots to be emptied of their water if there was any in them and then with a word of his mouth command the filling them with wine instead of it here had been an unexceptionable miracle which no infidels could have cavild at for any thing but the needlessness of it but this subject matter of water spoils the credit of the miracle the waterpots it seems are to be filled before jesus could do the notable feat is not this enough to make us think that jesus was but an artificial punchmaker could not he create wine without water for a transmutation yes you will say he could what was the reason then that he did not this is a reasonable question to a learned priesthood and a rational answer should be given to it and a question too it is that heretofore has been under debate some said that the water might be used to abate of the saepe obest magnitudo ne miracula creditu sint facilia theophylaect in loc immensity of the miracle which otherwise for its greatness might have surpassed all belief but this reason will not do a miracle cannot be too great in itself if well attested to transcend credit but it may easily be too little to conciliate the faith of a freethinker the fathers of your church fetched a reason for the use of water here from the mystery but since mysterys on miracles are set aside by the priesthood of this age they are to assign another and good reason of their own or this miracle is to be rejected as a piece of art and craft in the operator if for no other reason than this that jesus used water to make wine  all that i have to say more to this miracle is that it is to be wished if jesus could turn water into wine that he had imparted the secret and power to his disciples of the priesthood of all ages since which would have been of greatest advantage to them in this world he has empowered them they say to remit sins which few old sinners think themselves the less in danger for and he has enabled them some say to transubstantiate bread into flesh and wine into blood which none but foolish and superstitious folks believe they ever did and he promised to invest them with a power to do greater miracles than himself even to remove mountains and to curse trees but i thank god they never were of so strong a faith as to put it in practice or we might have heard of the natural state as well as we do now of the civil state of some countries ruined and overturned by them but this power to transmute water into wine without labor and expense would have been of better worth to them than all their other priestly offices not that our conduits would thereupon run with wine instead of water or that wine would be cheaper and more plentiful than it is now excepting among themselves if they could withal curse vineyards they would make the best penny they could of their divine power and as surely as they can now sell the waterdrops of their fingers at a christening at a good rate they would set a better price on their miraculously made wine and give a notable reason for its dearness viz that miracles should not be cheap which would bring them into contempt and lessen the wonder and admiration of them   so ends the invective of a supposed jewish rabbi against this miracle which our divines as well as myself are to consider of an answer to whether they shall think themselves able to answer the rational parts of it consistently with the letter i know not but i own myself unable and believe it impossible for them to do it and therefore they must of necessity go along with me to the mystical interpretation of the fathers or this miracle will turn to the dishonor of jesus and disadvantage of his religion  justin martyr in dialog cum tryphone p     says it is absurd to take the stories of the marriages and concubinages of the patriarchs of the old testament in a literal sense and indeed literally considered they are some of them too luscious tales to be related by divine and inspired penmen whereupon he as well as st paul and philojudaeus in lib de abrahamo  turn these stories for the honor of god and edification of his church into an allegory consequently if justin had had an occasion to speak of this marriage before us there is no doubt on it but he would have made mystery of all and every part of it  to the same purpose origin in matt tract xxii says that since the law is a shadow of good things to come and writes sometimes of marriages and of husbands and wives we are not to understand it of marriages according to the flesh but of the spiritual marriage between christ and his church as for instance abraham had two sons etc here we ought not to confine our thoughts to carnal marriages and their offsprings but to extend them to the mysteries here signified and there are almost a thousand other places in scripture about marriages but in every place  unusquisque locus castum and divinum de nuptiis continet intellectum secundum expositionem moralem is to have a divine moral and mystical construction put on it whoever therefore reads the scriptures about marriages and understands no more by them than carnal marriages he errs not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god from hence may be easily concluded what was origens opinion about this marriage in cana of galilee if there were no other passages in him for a confirmation of it but to come closer to the purpose  st augustine aliquid enim and in ipsis factis innuit nobis puto quia non sine causa venit ad nuptias excepto miraculo aliquid in ipso facto mysterii and sacramenti latet pulsemus ut aperiet and de vino invisibili inebriet nos in loc johan says there is mystery signified in the story of this marriage as in all jesuss miracles which it becomes us to open and search for till if possible we are inebriated with the spiritual and invisible wine that jesus made at this feast and again nihil dicemus quid sibi velint hydriae quid aqua in vinum conversa quid architriclinius quid sponsus quid matter jesu in mysterio quid ipsae nuptiae ibid says let us then consider the several particulars of the story and what is meant by the six waterpots and the water that is turned into wine and the governor of the feast and who are the bridegroom and the bride and who is the mother of jesus in a mystery and what is to be understood by the marriage  and again says st augustine per hoc invitatus dominus venit ad nuptias ut ostenderetur sacramentam nuptiarum  illarum nuptiarum sponsus personam domini figurabat cui dictum est servasti bonum vinum usque adhuc bonum vinum id est evangelium servasti usque adhuc ibid  there is mystery in this marriage or jesus upon no invitation had gone to it the bridegroom is our lord himself to whom it is said thou have reserved the good wine of the gospel until now that is until the typified time of the celebration of this mystical marriage which according to st augustine sex hydriae sunt sex aetates temporum capientes prophetiam pertinentem ad omnes gentes sive in duobus generibus hominum id est judaeis and graecis sive in tribus propter noe tres filios ibid is to be on the sixth age of the world signified by the six waterpots holding two or three firkins apiece that is all mankind as they are divided into the two sorts of jews and gentiles or into three as they are descended of the three sons of noah  and in another place the same st augustine interpreting this story says vocatur salvator ad nuptias hoc est ecclesiae voto spiritus sanctus invocatur  venit cum discipulis suis id est in loco sancto turba sanctorum mirabilia dei maria matter expectat hoc est virtutem christi expectat ecclesia  maria ait ecce vina deficiant hoc est vinum spiritus ecclesia optat excipere  numquid mulierem dicit jesu mariam quae virgo post pactum inventa est sed ecclesiam alloquitur quae non solum mulier sed meretrix nuncupatur in sermon xcii append thus our savior is invited to a marriage what can that mean but that the holy spirit is courted and invocated by the church wishing to be espoused to him jesus comes with his disciples that is into a holy place of a company of saints mary the mother of our lord signifies to him that they have no wine so the church makes known to him the deficiency of the spirit which she waits for the power of and if jesus calls mary a woman he means the church who by transfiguration may be a virgin the mother the spouse of christ and a whore too  and again st augustine explaining vinum multis locis accipimus scripturas sanctas meracissimum vigorem coelestis sapientiae continentes quibus incalescant sensus and inebrientur affectus operante christo in cana galileae vinum defecit and vinum fit id est umbra removetur and veritas praesentatur recedit lex gratia succedit carnalia spiritualibus commutantur bonum quidem vinum est vetu testamentum sed sine spirituali intellectu vanescit in litera in sermon xc append sed illud quod in litera legis aquam sapiebat dum spiritualiter intelligi fecit aquam in vinum convertit in sermon xci append what is meant by the water and the wine that it would be turned into at the time of the spiritual celebration of this marriage of christ with his spouse of the church says plainly enough that by water is meant the letter of the scriptures and by the best wine is to be understood spiritual interpretations which would transport the understandings of men with divine knowledge and warm their hearts and affections into a spiritual inebriation after the similitude of wine natural  st theophilus of antioch a most ancient greek commentator who according to bishop smalbroke should strictly adhere to the letter says per nuptias conjunctionem christi and ecclesiae hoc est veteris and novi testamenti traditionem debemus accipere sponsus est christus architriclinius est moses in loc johan  that by this marriage is meant the conjunction of christ and his church as it is the tradition of the old and new testament and that jesus himself is the bridegroom and moses the governor of the feast  other fathers such as st cyril st theophylact and st jerome are of the same mind about the mystical interpretation of this marriage as might be proved by passages out of them if i had room here to cite them but i must observe here that according to the fathers the story of this marriage is but another emblem of the marriage of the lamb with the bride of the new jerusalem spoken of in the revelations to which all the fowls of the air will be invited that is spiritual and heavenly minded christians who volucres coeli sunt vere puri and ad caelestis sapientiae cognitionem evolare parati clem alex strom l iv soar and fly aloft in their divine and sublime contemplations on the anagogical sense of the scriptures which will exhibit those intellectual dainties they are there to be entertained with  what i have here said out of the fathers to the story of this marriage is enough to quicken our divines to search for the like mystical interpretation of the whole the part of it that is most difficult to be spiritually expounded is that saying of jesus to his mother woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come for the clear interpretation of which i own i meet with little in the fathers but st augustine quid mihi and tibi est mulier procul dubio fratres latet ibi aliquid mysterii in loc johan assures us there is latent mystery in the words how then shall we come at it why if we cast away the interrogation and look upon the sentence as ellyptical like an infinite number of prophetical ones the sense paraphrastically and agreeably to the rest of the mystery arises thus in answer to the woman of the churchs expectation of the wine of the spirit jesus will tell her or make her to understand of what importance it is to her and himself to be supplied with that mystical wine to her edification which it was not his time to pour forth upon the church till the celebration of his nuptials with her  and thus have i done with the miracle of jesuss turning water into wine at a marriage of cana of galilee whether it be not an absurd and offensive story according to the letter let any one judge if the supposed jewish rabbi has forced a worse sense upon it than it will naturally bear our clergy may expostulate with him for it which they hardly will any otherwise than by exclamations against him without reason and authority but in the mystical operation of this miracle at the marriage of christ with his church there will be the wisdom and power and goodness of god visible and it will be a demonstration of jesuss messiahship in as much as the water of the letter of the law and the prophets cannot be turned into the wine of spiritual interpretations but we must discern how he is the accomplisher and fulfiller of them and so i pass to an     eleventh miracle of jesus viz matt ix mark ii luke v that of his healing a paralytick for whom the roof of the house was broken up to let him down into the room where jesus was  and this story without excepting that of the pool of bethesda is the most monstrously absurd improbable and incredible of any according to the letter there is not one miracle of jesus specifically related that does not labor under more or less absurdities either in substance or circumstance but this for number and greatness of absurdities i think surpasses them all and the absurdities of it too are so obvious and stare a man in the face that i wonder they are hitherto overlooked and that considerate and intelligent persons have not before now hesitated and boggled at them if interest had not blinded the eyes of our learned clergy they would easily have descried the incredibilities and absurdities of this story and in another impostors case presently have pointed them out to the ridicule of his admirers and adorers  if a man was to torture his brains for the invention of a romantic tale of improbable and surprising circumstances that he might withal hope to palm for a truth if it was but for a week or a day upon the faith and understanding of the credulous he could never have presumed i think so far upon the weakness of their intellects as to imagine any thing so grossly and notoriously contradictory to sense and reason would have gone down with them as is this before us which has passed currently through many ages of the church has been read with attention by the learned and revered by the rest of christians without any exception hesitation or doubt of the truth of it in short so palpable is the falsity of the story of this miracle that it requires no sagacity to detect it and was it not for the sake of the mystery more than to expose the folly of the clergy in believing of it i had never bestowed the following pains on it  the people it seems so pressed and thronged about the door of the house where jesus was that the paralytick and his bearers could not get near it what did they so throng and press for was it to see jesus who was without form and comeliness according to the prophet isaiah or who was one of the most graceful of the sons of men as painters and publius lentulus do describe him this could not be the reason of the crowd tho a person extraordinary either for beauty or deformity may attract the eyes of the people and occasion too a throng about him yet this could be no reason for a press about jesus at capernaum where he dwelt and was commonly seen and well known  was it then to hear him preach nor this neither tho an excellent preacher does sometimes and a very indifferent one does oftener draw multitudes after him yet jesus as a prophet was without honor at capernaum his own country consequently it is not to be supposed that for his doctrine he was so much followed here tho we read that he preached the word unto them  was it then to behold him working of miracles and curing of the diseased this is the likeliest reason of the crowds and throng about him and perhaps it was a day appointed beforehand for his healing of the diseased which might occasion a more than ordinary concourse of the people but then this reason would have induced the people to make way for the lame blind and paralyticks to come to jesus or they frustrated their own hopes and expectations of seeing miracles wrought and acted more unreasonably than ever mob did or can be supposed to do  but whatever was the reason of this tumultuous crouding which is hard to be accounted for it is said the poor paralytick with his bearers could not get to the door of the house for the press and therefore in all haste is he hauld to the top of the house and let down through a breach of the roof into the room where jesus was what need was there of such haste and pains to get to jesus for a cure it was but waiting a while not many hours and in all probability the tumult would be appeased and access easily had to him but that the bearers of the poor man should enterprise a trouble and difficulty that could not require less time than the tumult could be supposed to last is a little strange and somewhat incredible  st chrysostom says paralyticus repletum videret theatrum aditus interclusos portum obseptum  non tamen dixit propinquis suis quid hoc rei est expectemus quousvue domus evacuetur theatrum dimittatur recedent vui congregati sunt poterimus privatim ad illum accevere in homil de hoc paralyt  that the paralytick saw that the marketplace or street was thronged with people who had obstructed all passage to the house where jesus was and yet he did not so much as say to his friends and bearers what is the reason of this tumult let us stay till it is appeased and the house cleared of the people who ere long will depart and then we shall privately and quietly get admittance to jesus but why did he not say so any one beside himself and his bearers if they had any reason and senses about them would have so argued st chrysostom says it was their faith that made them in such haste to get to jesus but i should have thought their faith might have worked patience and disposed them to stay till jesus could come out to them or they get in to him and it is an addition to the strangeness and incredibility of the story that it did not  but supposing this paralytick in such haste and danger of life that he could not wait the dispersion of the tumult but for want of a free entrance at the door is cost what it will to be raised to the top of the house and a breach must be there made for him the question is whether such an enterprise was or could be feisable and practicable i have no conception of the possibility of it if they could not get to the door of the house for the press of consequence they could not come at the sides of it how should they over the heads of the people that is not to be imagined consequently here is another difficulty in the story that renders it yet more strange and incredible  but without questioning the possibility and easiness of getting the parlytick and his couch over the heads of the mob to the sides of the house thither he is brought where we now behold him and his bearers with their pullies ropes and ladders that were not at hand nor could suddenly be procured hauling and heaving him to the top of the house of what height the house was is not of much consequence some for the credit of the story may say dicet aliquis valde dimissum fuisse locum a quo per tegulas deposuerunt paralytici lectum johan nepot hieros in loc luc  it was a very low one tho ancient and modern commentators are pretty well agreed that it was an upperroom where jesus was consequently the house was at least two stories high but if it was much higher i will allow that art and pullies which they wanted for the present would raise the man and his bed to the top of it so we will not dispute nor differ upon that matter on the top of the house then we are now to behold the paralytick and his bearers with their hatchets and hammers etc which they forgot to bring with them for they could not think of any use they should have of them uncovering the roof of the house breaking up tiles spars and rafters and making a hole capacious enough for the man and his bed to be let through an odd strange and unaccountable work this which if they had not been cunning fellows would hardly have entered into their heads to project but at work they are when it was well if jesus and his disciples escaped with a only broken pate by the falling of tiles etc and if the rest were not almost smothered with the dust for it was over their heads that the breach was made where was the good man of the house all this while would he suffer his house to be thus broken up and not command them to desist from their foolish and needless attempt till the mob was quelled and there was a free entrance at the door of his house which could not be long first is there nothing in all this of difficulty and obstruction in the way of the belief of this story  some modern commentators being aware of these difficulties in this story and willing to reconcile men to the easier belief of it say as drusius judaeorum tecta plana erant and non in coni formam fastigiata in loc luc did that the houses of judaea were flatroofd and not ridgd and doctors lightfoot and whitby in loc marci say there was a door on their flat roofs by which the jews used to ascend to the top of their houses where they discoursed on the law and religious matters and that it was through such a door by a little widening of the sides of it that the paralytick was let down in the presence of jesus to which opinion i would yield if it was not liable to these objections viz that it is not reconcilable to what st luke says of their letting the paralytick down through the tiling with his couch in the midst where jesus was nor hardly consistent with what st mark says of their uncovering and breaking up the roof of the house which expressions the evangelists had never used if there had been a door for him to descend by but to indulge lightfoot and whitby in their notion i may ask them what occasion was there then of widening the doorway and breaking down the sides of it they will say because the passage otherwise was too narrow for the mans couch to get through why then did not they take him out of his couch and let him down in a blanket a chair or a basket or rather why did not jesus to prevent this trouble and damage to the house ascend through this door to the top of it and there speak the healing word to this poor man to say that jesus could not or would not go up to the paralytick i would not for fear of an imputation of blasphemy against me our divines therefore are to look for what they will hardly find an answer to the said question which will consist with the wisdom the goodness and honor of jesus or here will be another and insuperable bar to the credibility of this story  in short there are more and greater difficultys affecting the credit of this miracle on the side of jesus than any before urged could not he as it was anciently numquid enim facilem illi potuit accessum reddere apud chrysostom de hoc paralyt objected have made the access to himself more easy could not he to prevent all this trouble and pains of getting to the top of the house and of breaking up the roof of it have desired or even forced the people to make way for this poor man and his bearers this was not impossible for him to do if it was hard for another it was not for him who was omnipotent he that could drive his thousands before him out of the temple and draw as many after him into the wilderness might surely by force or persuasion have made the people how unreatonably mobbish soever to retreat and shy did he not without a good and satisfactory answer which i cannot conceive to this question here is the most unaccountable and incredible part of the whole story that reflects on the wisdom the power and goodness of jesus if there had been no other absurd circumstances of it this is enough to spoil its credit so far as that i believe it impossible for ministers of the letter with all their wit penetration and sagacity to get over it  believe then the story of this miracle thus taken to pieces who can it is such an accumulation of absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities that a man of the most easy faith if he at all think cannot digest it is not credible i said to suppose the people of capernaum where jesus dwelt and was well known and little admired would at all press to see or hear him and if the occasion of their concourse was to behold his miracles it is less reasonable to think they would tumultuate to their own disappointment but rather make way for the diseased for the satisfaction of their own curiosity to come to him and if they did mob it to their own disappointment about the door of the house it was next to impossible for the poor man and his couch to be heaved over their heads and raised to the top of it more unreasonable yet to think the master of the house would suffer the roof of it to be so broken up but most of all against reason to suppose jesus would not give forth the healing word and prevent all this labor or by his divine power disperse the people that the paralytick might have present and easy access to him  whether all this be not absolutely shocking of the credit of this story let my readers judge in my opinion no tale more monstrously romantic can be told i dont here question jesuss power to heal this paralytick nor the miraculousness of the cure of him the trouble of that question is saved me by the many other incredible circumstances of the story which are such a contradiction to sense and reason as is not to be equaled in any thing that is commonly received and believed by mankind cicero says that there is nothing so absurd which some of the philosophers have not held and they might and did some of them hold gross absurdities but the letter of the story of this miracle before us which is the object of the faith of our learned priesthood at this day a is match for the worst of them  but as absurd as this story is i expect that our clergy will be disgusted at my ludicrous display of it and that archdeacon stubbs in particular will again be ready to exclaim against me and say that this is turning a miraculous fact and a divine testimony of our religion into ridicule whereupon it is to be wished that archdeacon would write what would be a pleasure to see a vindication of this story if he can account for the possibility and credibility of the letter of it he shall have my leave to make another dull speech in convocation against me and it is not unlikely but he may say as much for it as another man for as the story is senseless so it is the better suited to his head and brains but if he dont i much question whether any other clergyman of more wit will appear in defense of it  so absurd is the letter of this story that for the honor of jesus and credibility of his gospel it is absolutely necessary to turn it into allegory to the fathers then let us go for their help in this case if they did not read me a better lecture upon this miracle than do our modern commentators i should be almost tempted to renounce my religion upon it but as they have rationally and rightly instructed me in its true meaning so i retain my christian faith and admire the sublimity of the mystery which i am now to give an account of  by this paralytick st hilary in paralytico gentium universitas offertur medenda in loc matt says is to be understood mankind of all nations which opinion too the fathers held of the paralytick who was healed at the pool of bethesda and by his palsy is not meant any bodily distemper but the spiritual palsy of the soul that is as st augustine paralyticus potest intelligi anima dissoluta membris id est bonis operibus inter quaest evang and st jerome paralysis typus est torporis quo piger jacet in malitia carnis habens desiderium salutis and torporis ignavia and duplis cogitationibus ac si enervatus membris ostendit in loc marci interpret a dissoluteness of morals and an unsteadiness of faith and principles which is the condition of mankind at present who want jesuss help for the cure of it eusebius gallicanus in hoc enim quod ait remittuntur tibi peccata interiorem hominem id est spiritum paryliticum esse demonstrat hoc enim non dixisset si ad corporis infirmitatem respexisset non ideo corpus sanatur quia anima a peccatis liberatur in homil in dominic xix post pentecost says our saviors words signify that it is not a bodily but a spiritual disease here meant or he had never said to the paralytick son thy sins are forgiven thee which words respect the inward man and demonstrate the palsy here to be a disease of the soul  the man sick of the palsy had four bearers and who are they mystically in this case why the fathers sed qui sun isti quatuor qui hunc paralyticum portant and domino offerunt per hos enim nescio qui melius quam quatuor evangelistae intelligi possunt nulla enim anima nisi per istos domino offertur nulla anima nisi per istorum fidem sanatur eusebius gallican ibid sum paralyticus quia non operantur and immobiles sunt vires animae meae ad bonum sed si a quatuor evangelistis gestatus and adductus fuero ad dominum tunc audiam remittuntur peecata theophylact in loc marci understand by them the four evangelists on whose faith and doctrine mankind is to be carried unto christ for no soul can be brought unto him for the sanation of his sins and errors but by these four  but to the top of the house is mankind thus paralytically diseased to be carried by the four evangelists his bearers and what then is this house and its top the house of jesus is the intellectual edifice of the world otherwise called wisdoms house of the beautiful buildings of which the scriptures prophetically treat therefore to the sublime sense of the scriptures called the top tectum domus qua christus docet ascendendum id est sacrae scripturae sublimitas est appetenda bedae in loc lucae of the house is man to be taken he is not to abide in the low and literal sense non utique in infimis exterius qua turbae tumultuantur remanendum sed tectum domus etc ibid of them where people press and strive in vain to come to jesus but if he is taken to the sublimity of the scriptures and there open patefacto tecto aeger ad jesum summittitur quia reseratis scripturarum mysteriis ad notitiam christi pervenitur bedae in loc marci est paralysis interior ut pervenias ad christum forte enim latet medicus and intus

scripturarum aperiat ut per haec ad notitiam christi perveniat ejusdam in quaest   ta in evangel lucae the house of wisdom he will presently be admitted to the presence and knowledge of jesus  venerable bede who is altogether a a transcriber of the fathers for which reason i cite him among the fathers says et been domus jesu juxta alterius evangelistae narrationem tegulis esse contecta reperitur quia sub contemptibili literarum velamine si adsit qui reseret divina spiritualis gratiae virtus invenietur denudatio etenim tegularum in domo jesu apertio est in utilitate literae sensus spiritualis and arcanorum coelestium in loc marci  that by the tiles of the house spoken of in st luke is meant the letter of the scriptures which is to be laid open for the manifestation of christ and of divine mysteries to the healing of mans spiritual palsy the unsteadiness and dissoluteness of his morals and principles  so much in short then to the mystical interpretation of the story of this miracle the literal sense of it is so encumbered with romantic circumstances as are enough to turn a mans heart against christianity it self but in the mystery there will be a most stupendous miracle which will be not only an argument of jesuss divine power but of his messiahship as certainly as his house of wisdom of which the scriptures write is opened to the manifestation of his presence and to the cure of mankind of his paralytical disease called an instability of faith and principles  and thus have i in this discourse taken into examination three more of jesuss miracles which i submit to the judgment of my readers whether the literal story of them does not consist of absurdities improbabilities and incredibilites according to the proposition before us and whether there is not a necessity for the honor of jesus to turn them into prophetical and parabolical narratives of what will be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  my next discourse if my mind hold shall treat on the three stories of jesuss raising of the dead viz of the widow of naims son of jairuss daughter and of lazarus after which i will give the literal history of christs resurrection that sandy foundation of the church a review and so conclude my discourses on the miracles of our savior  to run through all the miracles of jesus and handle them in the manner i have done the foregoing would be a long and tedious work but if our divines shall think i have selected only those miracles which are obnoxious to cavil and ridicule and have omitted others that literally are a more unexceptionable testimony of jesuss divine power and authority i will for their satisfaction take more of them to task and give the letter of their stories the like ludicrous treatment if i mistake not the miracles already spoken to together with those of jesuss raising of the dead and of his own resurrection are the most famous and remarkable of any others and according to the observation i have made on the rest they are no less but rather more liable to ridicule and exception but if any are of a contrary opinion and will let me know which in their judgment are more unexceptionable miracles i will vouchsafe them an examination i am sure there is not one miracle which the fathers of the church did not turn into allegory and if we dont at this day make mystical operations of them they will none of them according to the letter stand their ground nor abide the test of a critical inquiry into them  i dont expect that this discourse will be any more pleasing and acceptable to the clergy who are ministers of the letter of jesuss miracles as well as of the prophecies of him than any of my former but their displeasure in the case will give me no disturbance nor am i concerned about any resentment they can make of it if they are offended at these discourses they should as they came forth have written solid confutations of them and so have prevented my publication of any more of this kind but instead of serious and potent reasonings against me i have met with little else but oral railings exclamations defamations and attempts for prosecution which have been so far from terrifying me that they give me a secret pleasure and animate me to proceed in the undertaking in hand  i did not much question but the bishop of st davids whom i looked upon as a person of ingenuity and learning would before this time have published somewhat in confutation of one or other of my former discourses whether he was not obliged to it or to make me some public reparation of the injury done to my reputation by his slanderous sermon i appeal now to the worshipful societys for reformation of manners to whom and to other civil magistrates i hope his sermon without reason will be a caution that no pulpitinvective move them to prosecute or think the worse of any author  liberty of thinking writing and judging for our selves in religion is a natural a christian and a protestant right it is a right that the magistrate as well as the subject are interested in and are to see to the conservation of or their understandings as well as their purses will be ridden and oppressed by an ignorant and tyrannical priesthood i urge not this for my own security against prosecution for infidelity and blasphemy declaring that if the bishops of london st davids or archdeacon stubbs who are zealous for persecution will but engage me on the stage of controversy and make good their accusations against me i will submit to the worst punishment that can be inflicted on the worst offender  in the mean time i will go on with my undertaking to the advancement of truth and demonstration of the messiahship of the holy jesus to whom be glory for ever amen
