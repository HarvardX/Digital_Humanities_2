the fate of sparta or the rival kings a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by mrs cowley  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternoster row mdcclxxxviii price one shilling and sixpence  to john cowley esquire when letters were in their insancy and when knowledge and the arts were groping their way through seemingly impervious mists some splendid name was necessary to give an author celebrity  hence the custom of dedications hence those foods of adulation which poured from the press and outraged the feelings of the addresser and the addressed  but now when poets and writers of every denomination accept patronage only from the public and when fame is to be obtained only by deserving it the custom of dedicating can be continued only as a medium through which to convey personal respect it is delightful to make an offering to those we love when that offering has had a value stamped on it by the voice of the world thus the fate of sparta wreathed with laurel seeks you in the recesses of a counting house and whilst you are engaged in supporting our tional manufactures and invoking commerce from her diant abodes solicits your attention to the muses  when i hinted an intention to address this tragedy to you you shrunk from the idea and desired me to choose a worthier name my dearest brother where shall i turn to find it this shall not be an address of adulation therefore i shall only observe that those to whom you are known will acknowledge that i am justified in the choice i have made of a patron and those who know you not will do my pride the credit to believe i should not have selected for that patron a man whose name and whose situation did not reflect honor on me  there is yet another motive for using my poetic wand to call your shade before posterity as your regard has been one of the chief blessings of my life i wish those who succeed us to know how much i hold myself indebted to it i wish my own children and yours to feel the sweet infuence of our mutual friendship and as they will carry in their veins the same blood to cherish in their hearts the same attachment dear children who will wander again and again over this page after the hand which traces it moves no more after the heart to which it is addressed has ceased to beat  i was going to conclude with this pensive idea but i recollect that i have not yet mentioned in ddicatory form the work dedicated the following tragedy then sir is in its fable and events all invention  except in the conduct of chelonice and the scene in the temple  and with the circumstance on which that is founded i have taken some liberties other deviations from history will strike you but if i have altered circumstances i have  by character leonidas at drury lane as in sparta is artful tyrannic and doats on his aughter the impetuous and crafty amphares who had destroyed agis continues his system cleombrotus ambitious and tolerably obstinate is yet sensible to the merits of his wife he though my hero is not a faultless monster  if the lady should be too perfect i appeal to the grave authority of plutarch who i believe is not suspected of writing fictions to compliment women  struck with admiration at the slight yet powerful touches with which that biographist had sketched the character of chelonis in his life of agis  i wondered such a character had never been brought on the stage to do honor to her sex  yet i had joy in reflecting that this was precisely the age in which it ought to be done for this age boasted a mrs siddons  how much the fate of sparta has been indebted to that lady and to some of the other performers the public prints bear testimony  and i gratefully record it because it is a circumstance highly flattering to myself and because i wish the present i thus offer you to be surrounded with every appendage that can make you feel it inestimable  with the best wishes and affection i have the honor to be your devoted humble servant h cowley  prologue written by mrs cowley spoken by mr wroughton to ask your favor we are by custom bound  thus prologue bows before you to the ground but interchange of favors we are told is a choice method to make friendship hold my gift is this  those chilly wintry nights whilst the frost glitters and the north wind bites i will waft you to the gentlest summer skies where rosebuds swell and the soft zephyr flies where the bright sun with scarce diminished ray novembers month bids charm like florid may where beneath myrtle shades the lover dies whilst gales with fragrance fraught perfume his sighs  to greece i welcome ye from drury lane where taste and arts first reared the immortal fane you have heard of spartan boys who let young foxes feed on their blood placid as beaus in boxes sans shriek or groan you have heard of sable broth more prized than rich ieed creams and luscious froth with many other monstious  noble things at which more naughty times have had their ings but long posterior to that virtuous day the events were born on which we found our play sparta conceived a whim to be polite black broth and bosomed foxes took their flight then luxury her floodgates opened wide and fashion onward rolled its heady tide plain dress and frugal meals soon dropped their yokes and godlike spartans  lived like other folks turned fiddlers brokers merchants gamed and betted this boasting what he won  this what he netted ladies their opra  boxers had their stage and spartan humphries soon became the rage their placemen sinecures could never refuse and zealinfected lords at times turned jews their doctors sage then hit upon a plan to mend the weak degenerate creature man they bad two monarchs wear the splendid crown castor and pollux like  this up  that down in another voice oh no they both at once must mount the throne and subject slaves in double slavery groan twas wise no doubt  yet this too passed away but first burst forth the deeds which fill our play the groundwork true  a little fancy grant where fact had in its bounties been but scant poets will fib all nations have allowed it and ours with blushing terror has avowed it oh pardon where you can and

camp before the walls of sparta enter mezentius and corex corex the conflict of the elements is past the tempest which so lately seemed to shake the crystal walls of heaven is appeased and agitated nature sinks to rest  mezentius rather she bids the elements be still that other conflicts may unfold their rage her war is past  and now the war of men the rush of armies and the shouts of death will shake this azure vault where rolling thunders hurrying but now the crooked lightnings on hailed with grand horrors the devoted night  corex no wonder that olympus should take part when empires vibrate in the scales of fate not more illustrious was the hour in which enthroned gods hung over the fate of troy and granted to celestial junos hate a peoples ruin  mezentius the avengeful gods look so on sparta and its hoary tyrant but where is cleombrotus the trumpets sound yet sound to arms in vain is this the leader who from the fields of thrace and proud iberia brought us to reap the richer spoils of sparta where is the courage which should lead us on and rouse the tardy valor of his soldiers  corex suspect his courage oh his daring mind spurns at all dangers and his wellearnd fame repels each hovering doubt  pierce thou the wood where yonder cypress hides the dazzling moon  i will this way bend my steps to seek the prince for it is within these glades he shuns the camp and to reflection gives his hours of glory going trumpets sound he hears bellonas voice its powerful charm will break the spells of gloomy solitude and give us back the warrior and the hero  exeunt opposite sides enter cleombrotus cleombrotus resistless sounds ye chase my lethargy and rouse the soldier in my languid heart  i will yield  i will yield it to the glorious impulse o moon whose silver beams shed their pale splendour on those proud spires adorning them for sacrifice  shine on ride cloudless through the etherial plains that when gigantic war strides over yon battlements and prints in every street its sanguine steps guided by thee his iron arm may spare all who invoke its mercy thy chaste light shall lead the matron and the trembling maid inviolate to safety  me it guides to chelonice the fell tyrants daughter yet my loved wife  dian avert from her and from my beauteous boy each hovering ill that to this melting heart i yet may press them and charm their terrors with the voice of love  enter mezentius mezentius at length then prince i have traced thy wandering steps the impatient soldiers seek thee through the camp even the hired mercenaries now boast ardors and thou whose all depends on this grand moment retirst to shades wrapped cooly in reflection  cleombrotus not cool mezentius though alone and thoughtful  for oh my throbbing breast is torn with feeling the mercenarys heart expands with joy for the rude hour of plunder mine my soldier contracts with fear lest that wished hour should grasp in undistinguished ruin her i love with him who though her father i must hate  mezentius these are a lovers fears contemptuously cleombrotus they are a husbands when i consider  in the rage of battle what various ruins stalk beneath its banners not to be agonizd is not to feel the engines which must level yonder towers may as they play form chelonices grave  mezentius she has forsaken thee  this wife so loved has left thy bosom for a tyrant fathers who seeks thy life and robs thee of thy crown  and if i woman know   cleombrotus thou know not her here is is no common heart  melting with love alive to natures softest impulses tenderest of all the tender faithful sex yet where her duty bids she has a mind firm and unbending as the laws of truth  mezentius erring report has spoke of her with honor  cleombrotus with highest honor it shall speak yet err not when the ephori bestowed on me the crown making me colleague with her faithless sire thoust heard how soon his lust of power impelled him to seek my ruin and to reign alone  mezentius his faction sunk and you became triumphant  cleombrotus twas then leonidas wrapped in despair fled to minervas altar  chelonice followed him there leaving a splendid throne and all the joys that wait on royalty to weep and watch upon the dewy pavement where stretched she found an abdicated father  mezentius let spartas daughters then be named with reverence and proudly boast amongst the grecian maids they breathe the air which nourished chelonice have you not since often wooed her to your arms  cleombrotus oh yes and there to fold her would be transport but in her heart the filial principle so strongly burns that easier twere to woo the murmuring ringdove from her unfledged brood than her from him who gave the charmer life she thinks his safety too hangs on her presence  oh can i blame the cruel lovely duty which thus unwilling holds her from my arms  mezentius fortune benignant look upon this night and a few hours shall see thee king and husband  cleombrotus dear glorious titles how my soul will grasp ye  mezentius the soldiers all in arms await the signal  cleombrotus first let the altars blaze propitiate heaven mars and bellona guide me in the battle precede my chariot nerve afresh my arm and give me ardors to command my fate the generous transport labors in my breast and conquest beams already on my helmet see  victory bends from yonder starry seat and waves her flag triumphant to the town  goddess i come  exit drawing his sword scene changes to the palace of leonidas enter amphares and nicrates meeting nicrates oh my amphares what an hour for sparta  amphares the hour indeed is busy and important see how the streets are thronged each house pours forth its fearful inmates whilst the eager hum of the enquiring multitude that breaks like distant surges on the invaded ear tears the repose of balmy nights still sabbath  nicrates how wide the event from the unblest design when agis the first colleague of our prince lost by ambitious arts his crown and life the ephori adjudgd his vacant throne to chelonices lord  uniting thus the father and the son they hoped to bind the fate of sparta in the wreathes of peace  amphares weak shortlived hope for mutual jealousies soon sprung in either breast which nursed by faction grew strong and shook the unwieldy fabric down whence are the king and princess  nicrates from the temple where vows and tears and immolated victims yet strive to smooth the sullen brow of fate  amphares stern fate demands far other immolations cleombrotus leads armies fleshed and keen as morning hounds when through the dew they course the lightning footed stag who can preserve ye  nicrates the king himself let him invest cleombrotus with the disputed scepter with the crown sparta adjudgd him and his fathers wore surely your eye amphares speaks a language too gayly placed for so sad a moment  amphares brother my spirit was not made for peace the burnished raven loves not more the tempest in which he sails upborne by warring winds than i the tempest of contending states it is in such storms superior natures rise and find a station niggard fate denied them  nicrates kindred yet uncongenial are our souls had thou possessed a mind less turbulent cleombrotus upon a steady throne had now been fixed and lacedemons hopes nourished and blooming in the lap of peace  amphares never for spite of old lycurgus law which doomed us to be ruled by double tyranny a biarchy beyond each mode of slavery mad power ever framed to gall a nations neck is that which least admits of peace or rule twas therefore i dethroned cleombrotus but with such secret and coercive skill that he believes me yet his friend  nicrates leonidas and he together reigned together swayed the spartan scepter nor did hellborn discord disturb through six autumnal suns their peace ten months leonidas has reigned alone and all is anarchy distress and war  amphares and all shall so remain till i have worked through all these tempests for myself a day glowing with brightness and unceasing luster  i would unfold my heart yet more but see the king and beauteous chelonice come  enter leonidas and chelonice with guards and attendants leonidas let all the troops be gathered on the ramparts  the troops let every man whose arm can wield a sabre let beardless boys and indolent old age rouse at the call  those leave their darling sports and these forget their aches  let all unite to crush the hopes and arms of proud cleombrotus  chelonice oh   leonidas why sighst thou chelonice  can thy heart say dares it feel one evanescent pang that a rebellious foe shall be opposed and perish  chelonice that foe is chelonices husband  leonidas grant that he is is not his foe thy father oh speak would have me be his slave or conqueror pausing unduteous silence which too strongly speaks thou would behold me dragged beneath this dome my aged limbs embraced by iron shackles my timeblanchd head dashed on the marble floor because the perpetrator of those ills is the loved husband of my only child sneeringly chelonice that he is the husband of thy only child heaven and thyself does know  but when that child forgets amidst her griefs that you are her father when she forsakes thee in the hour of sorrow or owns a duty to thy conqueror  then may the gods be deaf to all her prayers and shame and infamy weigh down her name  leonidas then daughter banish from your brow these clouds which boldly censure whom thy speech yet spares enter attalus hasty thy steps  thy news  attalus one from the camp seized and impelled by tortures has confessed cleombrotus this night triumphant means to fix his standards on thy palace gates his mercenary army mad for plunder and all the various rapines claimed by victors urge on our fate  the miners now beneath us form for the quick a wide capacious grave the battring rams already rear their heads threatening our walls with sudden dissolution  leonidas why then let ruin come  it is my election near twenty years i have borne the spartan scepter and shall i at his bidding fling it from me like a light toy of which possession cloys me no i will reign still  and still alone will reign or give up life and sovereignty together  attalus unhappy sparta then thy fate is fixed to oppose is vain let us stand aloof and watch the gathering cloud which bursting will destroy us  leonidas how slave what murmur at my will dispute his word whose breath annihilates thy race what are ye all but creatures of my breath i doom ye life  rejoice i bid ye die  sink silent to your graves now chelonice prepare thy mind for this nights great event for ere its circling minutes have been numbered thou wilt in thy fathers blood walk to his throne or see thy husband weltring at my feet thy heart must make a choice  for one of us thy prayers must mount to heaven  tell me not which lest this old hearts last pangs be rendered stronger lest thy fierce husbands sword within my breast should bite more keen  knowing that there twas sped by a loved daughters wishes  exit followed by all but nicrates nicrates observing chelonice fixed and mute she gives to grief a force beyond the storm of common female woes  pardon me princess oh break a silence which too strongly speaks flow precious tears and give her sorrows vent  chelonice tears nicrates do think such woes as mine can melt in tears  bid lighter sorrows weep mine shall be cloistered in my sickening heart  nicrates alljudging heaven what then are power and beauty what all the virtues which adorn the mind since all united cannot ensure repose  chelonice my soul has fortitude but oh its griefs are keen how shall i shape its wishes how my heart compel to prayer when every hope it scrms  such is my horrid fate must be a crime either against my father or my lord  nicrates oh that i would words   chelonice this is a night of deeds such deeds  and cannot i  oh cannot i whom most those deeds concern by one bold act turn from my fated race the ills which threaten hear me olympus  regal juno hear inspire your suppliant  send a ray of light to guide me in the darkness which surrounds me  nicrates the last sad ray thy father has extinguished since you cannot move his purpose all is lost even whilst we speak destruction hastens on this very hour your husband leaves the camp   chelonice eagerly enough thoust said it  heaven speaks through thee my husband and the camp  yes to the camp i will bend my lonely and adventurous steps there to his heart i will plead my fathers cause wrest from his strong resentments all i ask and bring back strength to spartas tottering walls  nicrates oh princess it is the sudden thought of frenzy the camp  think on the dangers   chelonice oh what are dangers when such duties call the spirit of my ancestors is on me a sacred fervor seizes on my soul a fire unknown glows in my trembling veins and chases from my heart each female weakness  nicrates heroism how false to say you are only made for man  chelonice my father and my country oh for these fearless i would lead an army to a breach scale hostile walls and leap like him of macedon amidst the foe and whilst the whizzing deaths sighed round my head scorn their mock terrors and their painless wounds  nicrates prudence avaunt  strong ardors in a cause righteous as this seem the still voice of fate that thus in secret whispers urges on to perfect its decrees  chelonice  yet i will not slight the sage precautions prudence would suggest these royal weeds ill suit a wanderers speed  the habit of a priestess thall conceal me hallowed beneath that sacred robe i pass nor friend nor foe presume to know my errand  that errand sanctify all ye who rule the actions of mankind however designed however begun our deeds yours is the end we mark the goal and blind begin our race in paths diverging from the happy place it is ye who guide us in the way unknown the motive ours the events are all your own  end of the first act act ii scene i the tent of cleombrotus cleombrotus surrounded by generals etc cleombrotus rising to the north bastion perdicas lead you the iberian troops and menecrates you support the thracians at the eastern gate i will myself lead on my loyal spartans then if i fall i fall midst those whose rights i should too cheaply purchase with my life  if i am conqueror with them to conquer will add to victory a sweeter sense and make my laurels dearer than my crown  corex live prince  live ever on the throne of sparta  cleombrotus he only lives a prince who lives a patriot and he who loves not those he is raised to govern is not their monarch but their scourge  mezentius the night wears on and thy devoted army demand to place thee ere its noon be past upon that seat thou know so well to fill  cleombrotus instant i will join and lead them to the battle their force superior and their honest cause must doubly act upon our fearstruck foes and bid them spare the horrors of a carnage enter officer thy face has tidings  officer from the town a priestess with hasty steps and accents that breathe music sweet and resistless as the golden lyre of beamyhaird apollo seeks thy tent royal cleombrotus  cleombrotus a priestess say thou surely of magnitude must be the errand which asks a messenger so pure and holy retire my friends it is due to rank like here is in a few moments he who bids you go shall bid ye follow nor will he stop till his glad voice shall hail you victors in sparta they go now attend the virgin the officer goes out and reenters with chelonice thus holy maid lowly and wondering i greet your presence  oh what great behest can have impelled thee from thy hallowed couch to seek amidst the hurry of a camp a careworn soldier  chelonice couch cleombrotus do thou then think within the mournful walls these feet have left that one unfeeling wretch can seek a couch or meditate repose thou have our sleep  our balmly rest lies tenterd on the sharp points thoust levelled at our hearts restore our rest bid the soft god of sleep again revisit our long watchful lids it is for this i seek thee in thy camp for this that humbly in the dust i bend asking thy pity for our wretched sparta  cleombrotus but that i dare not touch thy sacred form thou should not humbly bend  oh priestess rise she rises if this thy errand to our martial plain t were well the fire that burns within your temple yet felt your feeding hand  your altars virgin they are the places for your prayers to rise from there mixed with incense they might reach olympus but here alas they fall on sterile earth  or must return unanswered to your bosom  chelonice oh is it possible can thou who ownst a soldiers generous feelings think a moment on the dread horrors of this waning night and yet resolve to pull those horrors on us  cleombrotus bid your own sovereign save ye oh leonidas how wretched is this art yield me my crown and not descend to seek the aid of women to deprecate the vengeance thou provokst  chelonice oh by the flame that burns to chaste minerva leonidas stoops not to supplicate knows not the step that i unprompted take well do thou know his haughty princely soul that lighter holds the heavy ills you are charged with than to submit and invocate thy pity  cleombrotus it is well his firmness shall be firmly met return then priestess let your king prepare his roughest welcome for unbidden guests his roughest welcome we have sworn to merit and not a heart within this bannerd field but will sustain the arm his oath has bound  chelonice oh for a voice to perjure them  twere a celestial crime

voices without general cleombrotus  cleombrotus hear the impatient soldiery lead on i will follow with an arrows swiftness  spare spare me one moment  mars it is thus thou hangst clasping her upon the breath of venus thus anticipatst the dear reward of victory then dartst amidst thy foes and by her touch inspired hurlst thy bright vengeance over the insanguind field  chelonice do thou deceive me this the power of chelonice goes to the wing stay your rash speed your prince commands ye  stop stir not till he shall lead ye to your spoil yes lead them to their spoil thou mighty general guide your keen hunters where the timorous deer in their enclosures herded wait their fate  the conquest will be worthy them and thee  cleombrotus oh my beloved be worthy of thyself and of the fate with which the moment teems i wrest this night my crown from usurpation to place it on thy brow   chelonice to decorate my bier never shall the crown torn from leonidas circle his child  but go lead on your army here will i patient wait your cries of victory  the signal of my death  cleombrotus as to himself oh woman  chelonice it is not a womans but a spartans threat the hour in which thou vanquishest leonidas prepare the pile to flame around his daughter  cleombrotus princess thou do mistake thy duty  spartan and daughter of leonidas are titles dearest to thee   chelonice mistake my duty said thou when at a husbands feet i ask a fathers life do i mistake my duty  if i do i will ever so mistake and boast my error yes till leonidas sits throned in safety his daughter shall forget she is a wife  tear from her heart each trace of long past fondness and own no ties but those first awful ones stamped there by nature  cleombrotus wife of cleombrotus thy honor and thy fames derived from him thy happiness from the same source should flow how dear those hours  for sure such hours have been when thou disclaimst all joys but in my love  chelonice had thou found bliss in love   cleombrotus smiling i would not sought bliss on thrones thus as a lady would you chide and this let all the subject world receive as law let them be taught that in the humble shade far from the reach of proud ambitions eye felicity has raised her grassy seat and wantons there with love but madam i was born to reign and he so born feels fires that vulgar souls could not endure  felicity to us is not a nymph in humble russet clad sipping the dewdrops from the silver thorn or weaving flowers upon a streamlets brink  oh no she is sceptered and her gifts are crowns  chelonice i have a soul to taste her gifts like thine i have a mind that grasps sublimer cares than cottage nymphs can know i would be great and bear the cares of thousands  but ambition and every lofty sentiment it gives sinks to the earth when weighed against his life from whom i drew my own  cleombrotus were i disposed to grant thee all and sink again to nothing yet am i bound to lead my forces on it is not glory nor the hope of same the mercenary feels  his god is plunder should i protract their promised hour of harvest disgust and mutiny would fill their ranks  i cannot dare not yield to thee  chelonice farewell i will be the herald of thy near approach the child shall bid the father bare his bosom to her lords sword  shall bid the citizens throw wide their portals to admit the conqueror then whilst my spartans bow their necks beneath thee and from a parricide receive their chains then shall the last sad sighs of chelonice mixed with the shouts of victory proclaim her murderous husband lacedemons king going cleombrotus the last sad sighs of chelonice  oh following and leading her back sweet cruel tyrant who is victor now nature in mockery thou stilst us lords and bidst us govern in this turbid world the historic page recording all the acts that stand the loftiest in an empires annals reports but womans will  chelonice then thou do yield how my soul thanks thee peaceful hours shall tell now on joys swiftest pinions let me bear the grateful tidings to the gates of sparta oh filial duties be ye ever crowned with joy as pure as blesses chelonice  exit led by cleombrotus enter mezentius and corex mezentius the confrence thou have heard  where now the hopes the high raised hopes we brought with us from thrace  corex they must exist no more  she who could win him to spare her lacedemon but an hour now when the impatient soldiery pant for conquest and every breast glows with portentous ardor next may like omphale transform her hercules to story in the loom his bloodless siege  mezentius but thrace boasts warriors of more stubborn nerves they neither know to yield to womans threats or mans defiance the laconic prince enticed us from our native fields to curb those rebel citizens who yet disown his rights in lacedemon our reward their herds their jewels and their treasured wealth must we forego the riches he affiancd because his chelonice begs forbearance  corex no  the wages of our labor are at hand our troops obedient why then not assault the city we came hither to reduce and gather for ourselves the promised blessings  mezentius our countrys genius corex speaks in thee astrea throw thy useless balance by thy sword is all we ask  he who bears that can right himself and punish his deceivers  corex let caution guard her sword cleombrotus supported by the iberians may prevent the glorious perfidy we meditate revolt seems ripe  see how resentment burns looking through the wing amongst the troops whilst he unfolds his will to spare leonidas for this one night the pain to be unkingd contemptuously mezentius let us assist fanning with secret breath the struggling flame and then this womans soldier shall be taught those grand events which mark the fate of empires and stand protruded to instruct the world are not the coin of female artifice but struck by genius from a bolder dye  exeunt scene changes to the palace enter leonidas and amphares leonidas forsaken by my child it should be so this is an hour of congregated woes and the barbd point of that should not be wanting does the enemy advance  left by my daughter left for a rebel husband  they are too tardy destruction slow of foot to those whod meet thee quicken thy pace  amphares destruction hastens on the princess fled and longing for thy crown urges her husband to the unnatural conquest  leonidas i do not curse  mark me i do not curse them leonidas and cruelty are sounds that in the mind of greece combine and live like pestilence and its funereal urns am i now cruel those late turbid veins in which such raging fires have coursd each other have now no pulse for cruelty yet should i  oh the thought rouses all my latent fury  should i amidst the battle meet those pelicans gods grant me such a moment that my life in that last closing act may end more blessed than crowns and vengeance ever made its progress  nicrates without where is the king enters leonidas here is he who in an hour shall be the king no more  nicrates not so leonidas the enemy whose late deserted camp poured all its eager troops upon the plain are housed again beneath their tented roofs their banners closed their spears bright gleams extinguished  leonidas how is this known  nicrates cloudless the full orbd car of the nocturnal goddess glides along giving each object perfect and distinct the crowded ramparts blessed the favoring light which showed their foes retiring and unarmed  amphares this is some subterfuge the subtle princess and her ambitious lord have framed the artifice to lull thee valiant prince in false security  leonidas well have thou spoken what thy king conceived but who shall speak the fathers mad despair oh isis when thou threwst the unfeeling flints and bade them rise to animated man they disobeyed thee  womans was the form in which they sprung to life in which they yet cumber the earth  our cherished bosomed plagues  nicrates oh sir forbear the virtues of the princess   leonidas mention her not henceforth to name the rebel but with the curse of parricide is fatal to him who speaks  fly to your several stations the credlous citizens have lost their fears but i will restore and fix them in their hearts to live a sovereign but one added day is worth the labor of an untird hercules  exit nicrates stay my prompt brother you may snatch a moment from duty so imposed  yours is the storm which rages in his heart against his daughter  amphares i know i raised the storm and there will feed it  nicrates hah to what end  what purpose  amphares i will reveal it not to that air of menace which i scorn but to thy love fraternal which insures me ready attention and if needful help  nicrates one bosom fed us with it is lucid stream one father gave to us a dear existence and in my heart i prize each sacred bond yet not those bonds the father whom we loved not the chaste mother at whose breast we clung shall bribe me to forget superior duties or aid thee in a cause disclaimed by virtue  amphares sneeringly warm from the schools and prompt in declamation  nicrates not so the plain simplicity of spartan schools disclaims and abrogates misleading eloquence you bred in athens  where the polished virtues luxuriantly repose giving their documents in marble palaces and robes imbued with every gaudy stain that paints their fields  it is you who boast the unthrifty charms of rhetoric which makes a shadow seem substantial good and clothes with glowing periods crippled morals  yet let me know why thou inflamst the king against the paragon of female excellence  amphares a paragon i thought her and her birth which called her dower a kingdom fixed me here is our line a scion from that root whence sprung leonidas  which justified my hopes in athens twas i learned cleombrotus was made her husband and coequal king had i been here the hymen of that day had dipped his saffron robe in sanguine dies  nicrates but now   amphares but now my hatred is in youthful vigor and i have sworn their ruin  nicrates sworn their ruin  amphares interrogative brother yes  their deaths were they no more then lacedemons free and who could stand twixt me and royalty but a weak boy whose tender bud of life fatality or accident may nip what do thou mutter spells with eyes thus fixed  nicrates steadily nor spells nor prayers for surely they were lost nor shall i reason on thy wicked hopes nor bid thee dread the vengeance of the gods for to a mind that such designs can cherish reason religion urge their truths in vain then fear not these but fear my vigilance go on spread all thy toils prepare thy snares and i will watch observe and counteract thee  exit amphares oh insolent and vain oppose me not counteract him who struggles for a crown him who dares raise his hopes to spartas princess thy gentle breath might hope as well good brother to puff a mountain from its solid base as to move me from purposes so grand thou talk of virtue  i behold a throne thou bidst me fear  i think on chelonice  end of the second act act iii scene i the tribunal enter leonidas amphares sarpedon attalus and others leonidas yes the bright sun beholds me yet a king  cleombrotus is yet without our walls for this let every altar blaze with sacrifice and hallowed victims pour the sanguine stream  amphares in vain shall hallowed victims pour their life and blood of hecatombs bedew our altars whilst treason deep veiled spreads out her silent snares  leonidas her veil shall be removed her snares developd here in this awful seat where great lycurgus wooed justice from her high olympian court and bade her rule unswayd by human ties  here shall leonidas his glory emulate and rise above the pleaded bonds of nature say did thou find the princess bathed in sorrows  sarpedon not lost in tears but in more stately griefs her virgins tell she passed the sleepless night denied to vindicate her secret visit  amphares whether in tears or sorrows more reserved women express their passions or their will they are each resistless arms whose edge is bluntless but sir youre guarded  leonidas to a test i will bring  her vaunted duty if it shrinks from that hence

foes princess of sparta know this charge is thine  chelonice if i have incurred it may the death she dooms to traitors fall on me  not daughter now but subject and arraigned i bend before thee  not to a father pleading but a judge  leonidas it is lacedemon calls thee to the trial  chelonice nay but all greece will turn their eyes toward thee and as thou actst at this important hour will load thy name with honor or dispraise beware of weakness then  with rigor try me and if the crime imputed should be mine then agamemnon like devote thy child a sacrifice to your immortal fame the world demands such lessons  oh suppose not i should disgrace the glorious part assigned me  the daughter of leonidas cannot fear to die  leonidas such firmness should by innocence be sanctiond last night disguised you passed our sentinels bending your steps where your rebellious husband plots lacedemons ruin  it is your motive to this mysterious visit we demand  chelonice behold it in your undemolishd walls behold it sparta in thy lofty spires which yet triumphant catch the sailing clouds see it ye mothers in the tender babes reposing safely on your matron bosoms and you ye husbands in whose sheltering arms your wives yet live inviolate and pure those were the motives of my secret visit  leonidas do spartas welfare and her matrons honor hang on a thread so slender do her battlements her long enduring walls and brazen gates resist destruction at a womans bidding  chelonice forgive the seeming boast yet had not chelonice last night stole secret to her husbands camp and there with every art love makes resistless won him to change the purpose of the hour this roof beneath whose dome she stands accused had now resounded with the shrieks of death whilst through our gates thrace and iberia poured with mercenary hand their slaughtring troops  leonidas if such thy purpose and if such the event then daughter lacedemon owes to thee that she enjoys one added day in safety short respite from impending woes were t in thy power to prolong her safety and banish from her skies those hovering locusts  oh could thou for an end so sanctified boldly resolve to be a spartan daughter and tear unworthy weakness from thy heart  chelonice my heart itself what is there can exist that i would not sacrifice to save my country and bid my father live  leonidas rising glorious the moment twould be fame immortal the name of chelonice shall be heard wherever female acts of worth and daring rescue the sex and make them shine over man  thy worthless husband ceased he to exist thrace and iberia would withdraw their troops and sparta rest from cursed intestine wars invite him from his camp  propose this night to meet him in the grove  he shall be met by arms less tender than my chelonices  chelonice horror  leonidas do shrink  are those thy boasted fervors  chelonice it was my father twas my father spoke it  i have no answer  leonidas rebel thy answers made for now i know twas but a false pretense with which thoust glossd thy visit to the traitor  traitor thyself and leagued with spartas foes  chelonice o filial goddess teach me to submit  leonidas submission now is all the duty left thee and thou shall learn to practice it in chains bear her to prison as a rebel guard her and let her son be captive with his mother  chelonice that is mercy yet amidst the judges firmness the parents love steps in to chase despair bring here my chains  they bring and put them on amphares to leonidas the opposing principles of filial duty and connubial love summon their forces in her heart and one must yield forgive if in the conflict filial duty fails and gives the dearbought triumph to a husband  chelonice who told thee that those principles oppose or that one yields has nature then improvident so narrow formed the heart that only one of all the various duties she commands can live there know misjudging reasoner the duties of the wife and child may each without opposing warm the

with supplicating looks bending before thee shall they implore in vain they ask a sire to breathe forth mercy on a sorrowing child o hear their prayers  mine is the voice of sparta  chelonice plead for a rebel pity how misplaced addressing the citizens should i be spared the door for treasons opened nor could your prince dare punish in another the crime his child unforfeited commits he wisely acts and thus i clasp my chains calling the gods to witness they are dear to me for they are a fathers gift  perhaps his last lead to my prison murmur not be proud that in your sovereign you have found a hero who will punish those most precious to his heart when crimes against your rights call down his vengeance lead on  exit with guards etc amphares see selfarraignd the princess goes acknowledging the justice which condemns her to the citizens leonidas she may be innocent yet to refuse a sacrifice which patriotic love and filial duty equally demand is in itself a crime to merit chains amphares speak is there no way cleombrotus would come as general with a train too costly for the charge of sparta  is there no way to gain a private solitary visit by heaven the man who should perform such service i would rank for ever next my crown and life  amphares swift execution ever should attend the will of princes when that wills revealed methinks there might be found a man in sparta who brided thus highly would despise the danger and call it glory so to save his country  leonidas if such a man there be  thou know the rest time presses hard my friend and fate allows but a few hours for acts whose fame shall live through ages yet unborn  i will leave thee now genius of sparta aid the unripe design  exit amphares contemptuously genius of sparta do think me to cozen with

cleombrotus enter cleombrotus followed by mezentius cleombrotus by heaven the man who stirs toward the town with hostile views shall find his death not there but from my arm nor will i bear these murmurs lead back your maddning thracians who appear like midnight wolves snuffing the air for prey rather than soldiers bravely met to right an injured king  mezentius so think them midnight wolves will not retire without their scented prey resolve then to dismiss or lead them on  cleombrotus i can do neither i am bound by oath  an oath revered by him who shakes olympus not to begin the attack till this days sun resigns the race to him who gilds tomorrow  mezentius what forced thee to the binding oath  cleombrotus to tell thee obdurate thracian were to give thee words whose foreign sounds would vibrate on thy ear but could not raise ideas in thy mind what do thou know of all the sacred charms which hang on love connubial why tell thee of the sweet philtres on the rosy lips of chaste yet tender beauty ears like thine would find no music in the tale nor own twas a sweet madness so to be undone  mezentius undone indeed  cleombrotus yet not undone  my promise binds me but a few hours  ere the blue heavens shall in its present station see again you radiant orb  by arms or peaceful terms i shall be king in sparta  mezentius hopes of coward peace were not the prospects thou heldst forth to draw us from our dear homes  cleombrotus true war and victory seemed then the road to lead me to my throne but should leonidas propose those terms on which i must consent to raise the siege then rich rewards shall gratify your troops without the crimson labor which they pant for  going to one of the upper wings mezentius our troops will not accept a largess prince where they can claim a right and on thyself rest all the mischief of thy broken faith  cleombrotus behold the messenger of peace approaches  what humbler cause could make amphares messenger his rank exalted and his skill in

of his native city nor drain her veins to justify his crimes  amphares secret his counsels prince nor do i know whether the gloomy tyrant waits your sword or means to yield your crown without compulsion  cleombrotus art thou not come the ambassador of peace  amphares oh no  cleombrotus ill founded hope with anger amphares had thou such hopes  cleombrotus or know this hour amphares were not his to waste in insolent deliberation but if not peace what cause   amphares i know thy question though on no public errand i approach you yet will you think the cause not less important than if an empires fate hung on my breath  an empire did i say what then are empires what all the mighty nothings which embroil from age to age the sons of mad ambition  compared to those soft interests of the heart which though in name less splendid have a power that all the grander impulses must stoop to  cleombrotus then you are ambassador from chelonice what says my most beloved what fragrant message breathed her sweet lips to him whose fate she rules  amphares no message bear i prince for unsolicited amphares comes and perhaps returns unthankd  cleombrotus forbid it courtesy what urged this visit  amphares say rather what urged thee to sleep last night within thy camp whilst every spartan citizen kept wakeful to salute thee once more king  cleombrotus what but the powerful influence thou have named my chelonice  amphares hah was she the destiny who snatched thy scepter from thee  cleombrotus why amphares this sudden flashing of thy eye this scorn her filial heart was agonizd it asked

withhold the impending sword  cleombrotus for whom for whom say thou  amphares why should i speak such tales are met ungraciously hard to excite belief of what to yield to is to embrace the keenest agonies fate has prepared for man  cleombrotus heed me amphares the charge thou would lead to cannot be mistaken i see you are come to raise suspicion here where yet suspicion never knew to live but least to live when pointed at my wife  amphares thus should it be  this is the magic philtre bestowed by hymen in the brieal cup which when once swallowed makes a man  a husband sneeringly cleombrotus what is a husband angrily amphares what his wise shall please credulous doting disbelieving blind  cleombrotus were i of that quick temperament which flames and blazes at a touch thoust said enough to

sky  beware  amphares i am cautioned  from regard not fear  cleombrotus i know thou fear not nor can i suspect six yearly suns have belted round the world since chelonice at the altar vowed the duties of connubial love to me her heart i have studied watched each turn of temper nor ever saw caprice inhabit there her virtues though chastisd by female softness are of the grand and stubborn sort which selfcollected smile upon temptation o shall the rooted confidence of ages break from its stem and be the sport of whispers no amphares the husband of chelonice can have no fears but for his own demerits  amphares all then is well  cleombrotus not so for though no doubts can reach my heart that would dishonor her to justify her fame i must know all that malice dares suggest  amphares if to
