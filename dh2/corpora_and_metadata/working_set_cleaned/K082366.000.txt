an invitation to peace or tobys preliminaries to nestor ironsides set forth in a dialogue between toby and his kinsman  hor niger est romana caveto milt  why did he not accept friendly composure offered  london printed and sold by mr lawrence near st pauls churchyard  tobys dialogue with his kinsman etc a come come mr toby mr ironsides offers very fair and if you dont come to an accommodation what will the world say of you   t tell not me of offers accommodation and the world i say positively i will not hear of any reconciliation till he shall make me such proposals as may agree with my safety and honor and therefore i do insist that fort a  n be demolished and that for our security during the negotiation it be put into the hands of the sieurs took and barber and if he refuse to do this i am determined to hold it out and fight it to the last vid cat    a but sir consider a little you began this paperwar with no other view but supporting the balance of pamphleteering and you have now as is evident reduced old ironsides to so low a condition that perhaps he may be glad upon any reasonable terms to put an end to this long and bloody war yet sir whether his pen is so far subdued whether it be wrought by ill success to such a submission vid cat is what i mightily doubt of consider sir i beseech you what a deal of money that strong fort has cost him how he has perpetually annoyed you from that coast and    t sir you may talk till doomsday if you please but i shall make you no other reply than fort ad  son fort ad  son   a all this is towering frenzy and distraction vid cat and you talk as if you were sure of holding fortune by the forelock and of going down to the grave with the reputation you have now established whereas there is nothing so difficult and uncertain of this the person you now so much despise is a fresh instance how did the force of his pen in a few months overrun your whole country did he not in three weeks time take the strong towns of fenwick and cocoa politic coffeehouses used by the tories and where mr ironsides used to go formerly and dispute with many others did he not attempt to force the examiner that brave and experienced general out of his lines and was he not very near effecting it this should learn you sir some humility and to put an end to your extravagant way of talking besides remember sir we took up pens not to revenge our selves but free the commonwealth vid cat  now you have obtained this end you should hearken to reason or else the impartial world will say  and    t when fort a  son is once in my hands i will then send him some proposals which i think fit to make him subscribe as preliminaries to our treaty as first sir    the town of button the coffeehouse used by ironsides etc now garrisoned by wits shall be yielded up in the condition it is now in with all its dependences    the said garrison shall have free leave to carry off their effects but they shall not meddle with such wit as belongs to the inhabitants of the said town    that the garrison may march out with their pens in their hands each man allowed two charges with a sheet of fine foolscap paper    all commanding wits may be allowed to carry off as much wool in their hats as they shall think fitting but the said officers and commanding wits shall not carry off any wool in a clandestine manner nor transport more than what shall be allowed by this present treaty to any dutch coffeehouse within our dominions    that no wast be committed upon such oak as is now standing within the liberties of the said town but it shall be and is hereby lawful for each pastoral writer to carry off a large beach    that all sick and wounded wits may remain three months in the town of button counting from the time of signing this treaty and that it shall be lawful for them to send for dr g  provided the said dr g  shall give good security before such persons as we shall appoint that he will not at any time nor upon any consideration whatsoever offer to prescribe to any of our subjects and also that the said doctor shall not go armed with any epigram or panegyric but that it shall be lawful for the said doctor to wear what epilogues and songs he shall think fit provided the said epilogues and songs be neither lewd nor blasphemous    if at any time it shall happen that any dispute or quarrel shall arise between any of our guards officers or domestics ie footmen and the said mr ironsides we do declare that we will not intermeddle in such disputes or quarrels but freely permit the sieur ironsides to pursue the said quarrel as he shall think fit provided it be with such decency as is usually observed among footmen    we do also insist that all freethinkers ie atheists now inhabiting villa graeca do forthwith depart from our dominions and that the said villa be demolished in such time and manner as the sieur b  ly shall think fit    that the province of scandal be erected into a principality and settled upon our dear kinsman and ally abel roper and his heirs for ever that the said hereditary succession be not invaded by mr ironsides either directly or indirectly by word or writing and that for the better security the expressions crisis public spirit liberal education grave man of business as wise the best etc be hereafter never made use of unless in company with three or more wits of his own party in which case it shall be allowed to commend himself as much as he shall think fit and the said wits also may be allowed to believe as much as they shall judge necessary   0 that the sieur jacob librarian and stationer to the town of button be permitted to reside in the said town till such time as he shall have sold off all his effects excepting such as shall be specified contraband goods by the present treaty as all ambassadresss speeches etc     that the said sieur jacob be not permitted to erect any public booth or stage or expose to sight any lions bears or other monsters but that it shall be lawful for the said sieur jacob to keep open house on the fifth of november and dance himself for the diversion of any number of kitkats or kitlings not exceeding forty     it shall also be permitted to the said jacob to assist at the buying dressing and burning the pope pretender and as many cardinals as shall be thought necessary provided the said pope pretender and cardinals be bought dressed and burnt by an equal assessment and that there be always two or more ancient and grave persons of any quality not exceeding an e to take care that there be no riot or indecency committed at the said solemnity the d of mon  ue bought a whole pope at his own charge which was seized by the secretary of state      it shall not be permitted to burn dr sacheverell but it may be and is hereby lawful to burn the reverend dr t  p provided the said kitlings will consent to burn two or more preface writers in company with him     lastly we do insist that the englishman alias ironsides do at his own expense cause forthwith to be printed a new edition of cato with a large margin and a hand in the said margin pointing to such lines in the said play which in any way belong to the d of m and also there shall be another hand of a different make which shall declare what lines in the said play do belong to us or to our kinsman and dear ally abel roper we do also declare that the said edition shall in a very sincere and open manner ie without any equivocation or mental reservation declare at what lines in the said tragedy of cato the sieur englishman alias ironsides with his followers did not think fit to make a noise vg over against the verse it is time to sheath the sword and spare mankind cat  it shall be expressly said no clap but a great melancholy and some little confusion  item are not the lives of those who draw the sword entrusted to our care cat  another melancholy look ditto in two or three other places which we think fit to reserve for the general treaty but at  the work of ages  the roman empires fallen  cat  shall be a great stamp followed with a clap of two minutes long  item at when vice prevails and impious men bear sway the post of honor is a private station cat  shall be printed biggest clap with a nb that several kitlings swooned and that nic l  mere was carried off for dead  nb that in the said play we do think fit to reserve to our own use all such lines as shall make mention of any laborious virtue vg toil hard watching abstinence want of food etc  and now sir upon these preliminaries i will consent to a treaty and not otherwise   a modestly offered truly  pray what do you take mr ironsides for that you should think he would ever condescend to such conditions   t take him for why for one of mr congreves odd fellows with a great deal of your little sort of wit or if you please to let me give you his character plainer for one who vainly imagines to become from a bankrupt in poetry a haberdasher in politics or if this wont do i am sure he is like one of those wise men who laugh at a fools advice which god knows is sometimes as fit to be followed as that of a wits   a why sir i pray do you know of any fool that can help out our friend at a dead lift for faith as affairs stand he seems to want it   t yes that i do and as i am a publickspirited man and of a liberal education i think my self bound to tell you and it is sir the fool in lear   a and what says he   t say  why he says let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down hill lest it break thy neck by following but the great one which goes upwards let it draw thee after and then continues he when a wise man gives you better counsel give me mine again   a why truly i am of the fools opinion and should be glad if others would not despise it but do you think sir that mr ironsides who has been well bred a good scholar and a topping wit will ever strike sail to a fool   t i know not that but i am sure now is the crisis and the remedy may prove too late if deferred therefore prithee go to him and as from your self offer him some wholesome counsel  it is pity the poor fellow should be thrown away   a even go your self for me for i have done with him it was but on monday last when i went to see him at his lodgings in hopes to persuade him to a peace with you but    t but what   a what nay i am almost ashamed to tell you but when i knocked at the door his servant told me his master was at home but not stirring and it was then past eleven that he had had but a very bad night  i was afraid indeed he might have drunk some very bad wine or eat something that did not agree with him somewhat too course for a gentleman of a fine education but his servant soon set me right telling me he was sure his master had had some quarrel over night for that he often started and called out upon toby and the examiner talked much of hereditary right and ever and anon would cry out oh ad  n and will thou leave me thus upon which account i immediately came away giving a strict charge that all swords pistols and penknives should be taken from him and in coming back  do you see this his head was broke in going to visit mr s  le    t ay how came you by it   a why by a riot which i very unfortunately fell into at my coming out of his house for you must know the street where he lives is very far gone from the doctrine he perpetually harrangues them with and it is ten to one if you pass it without meeting with some public spirited cobbler or tailor who very insolently will give you a justle into the kennel should you offer at a question he immediately tells you it is his duty calls you tory damns you for a jacobite and so goes about his business nay even the constables of his parish have drunk so deep of his cup that they make no scruple to declare to you that as they are constables they are accountable to no man but that all england is accountable to them and this they will tell you with an air of insolence all which is to go for nothing because forsooth at the end they cry god bless the house of hanover as if it were impossible to say so without being impertinent saucy and troublesome and somewhat else which deserves a worse name and now i know where mr ironsides had his accountable and unaccountable   t no no i tell you the constable had it of mr ironsides and not mr ironsides of the constable though the constable indeed is one that understands public affairs very well besides mr ironsides does not absolutely say that he is not accountable to any body whatsoever but that he is not accountable so far as he is a member of parliament or rather so long as he shall be out of that capacity he well knows he is accountable how much and to whom and that as soon as he shall cease to be the representative of stockbridge and how soon that will happen god knows this account must begin    a well i will take care and distinguish you see however the constable will have no reserve but tell me mr toby for you are a very generous enemy will you not have some pity when that day shall come   t what day   a why the day of accounts  poor mr ironsides how will he then wish his public spirit had been less and his private economy more that he had never heard of dunkirk that he had never known the importance of it and    t how will he then wish he had retired betimes to his paternal seat the sabine field where his great ancestors told with their own hands etc vid cat    his qualification if he has any would have been enough to have entitled him to the office of justice of peace and he might have lived and died with a moderate reputation   a o dunkirk dunkirk   t ah that cursed port  but why did he not mind his business and leave politics to those who knew what to do with them i had not then meddled with him but let him thank himself for it i have washed my hands   a well i wish to god he would accept of your offers though they are hard and come to a friendly composition for really he has been a fellow of pretty parts   t has been  true  but is no more we allow as a tatler or spectator or as he was now and then a piece of one he had much merit in every spec his towering wit did soar and he was more admired and more and more spec lost in politics by all is mourned his brain alas the important port has turned o would he choose some fitter themein pastorals declare if philips or if pope excells or else translate some mother in distress for he grows less a wit and less and less and this is the best advice i can give him which if he will do and grant me my preliminaries with a very little more which i intend to ask he shall have peace and rest if not    a but mr toby are you sure mr ironsides is fallen so low   t fallen ay ay prithee look on this  pulls out his englishman a hey de what is here reads villain knave rogue fort dunkirk business all for the pretender an undeniable argument my duty true light house of hanover succession and constitution etc why this is never mr s  l   t nay if you can get any body else to father it i am mistaken   a what this mr ironsides   t ay even that  you may look as wild as you please so it is  and alas poor yorrick i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest most excellent fancy he has born me upon his back a thousand times and how abhorred my imagination is now my gorge rises at it  where be your gibes now your gamballs your songs your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table in a roar  quite chapfallen etc and thus sir going a little farther perhaps we may trace the mighty ironsides till we find him stopping a bunghole   a now you are too curious toby   t no no faith i only do it to show you to how vile uses we may return   a by this last speech mr toby it plainly appears the englishman is quite dead   t the world perhaps may take him for a dead man and to say the truth many an honest man has been buried without half this splutter but you must know mr ironsides can die ie be dull with a design vid spec when he pleases for eight or ten days and be never the worse for it but be assured whenever this fancy comes into his head there is some plaguey plot at the bottom   a come mr toby never fear his rising again clamatum est so even a done with your treaty what you will not negotiate with a dead man   t i tell you he is not dead he is only dozing a little that his wit may awake like catos soul renewed in all its strength and take its flight and be a match for toby  cat     a away you are too severe now what cannot mr add  n escape you but sir give me leave to tell you if you go on at this rate to play the ridicule with shakespeare and patch up a buffoon from the tags of sentences no one is secure and will any one think you sit tame under such an indignation in the name of common sense what do you take mr s  ls public spirit for   t take it for why for the foul fiend in lear which leads through fire and through flame through sword and whirlpool over bog and quagmire that has laid knives under his pillow and which perhaps may lay a halter in his pue   a if this be the case for gods sake some charity for poor dick whom the fou fiend vexes  but why eternally upon plays   t oh because it is the modish way of drawing a character and was first set on foot by a gentleman that understands the world very well   a enough enough i understand you him you mean who drew his general from cato   t yes and from thunder and lightning and scipio and a great rock and a destroying angel and from hannibal and him that beat hannibal and from two and thirty animate things and inanimate without number   a well i am glad however for one reason for now i shall never want something to put me in mind of mr ironsides and i would not willingly forgot him it is but turning over shakespeare in the comedy of errors i immediately shall find him as also in much ado about nothing but sure i am when i come to loves labor lost i shall then naturally think of the importance of dunkirk which he writ only as he kindly tells us for the love of his fellow subjects   t importance of dunkirk away with that trash   a what is not every man free to set up for a politician especially when he is sure of his own sufficiency and has all the reason in the world to be under horrible expectations   t a politician yes provided it be in his study he may there indeed pull down and erect praise and condemn and in short make a constitution hereditary or elective as he shall think fit but i must insist he has no right openly to revile a ministry because he likes not the faces of those that compose it which perhaps may be as good as his own though not yet in print in jacobs shop besides sir every man in his way mr ironsides understands latin understands the classics has writ three comedies alias farces has dined with a great lord and been at the burning of several popes but what has this to do with government mr dogget i allow you may divert us in low comedy but can never make a tolerable figure with the buskin and truncheon  what i beseech you would mr ironsides think if will pinkethman should take a fancy to play cato if at the beginning of the second act he should rudely break in and disturb mr booth and his little senate and talk of his liberal education of his being a grave man and fit for tragedy sure neither he nor his circle of pupils could forgive such an impertinence   a come come you are for stopping the mouths of people and restraining the liberty of the press a sure sign mr toby your actions will not bear the light   t as for stopping mr ironsidess mouth i dont think it of moment enough to go about it but you know friend it would be less offensive were it somewhat more cleanly therefore i will compound for washing it   a agreed and when it is washed what would you have next   t nay provided it be clean let him do what he will with it  but i advise him to return to his old inoffensive way of life   a what do you take him for a spider you know he never spun out of his own bowels or if he did he cannot spin to eternity   t why even let him do as spiders do gather up his web and begin again   a how do you mean   t mean why since his store is exhausted let him give us the same a second and a third time that is let him do as the players do for i cannot yet leave the stage study the taste of the town and repeat that oftenest which he finds goes down best let him daily put up a bill and declare what he intends for our diversion as for example at the shakespears head on this present tuesday being the   th of this instant will be reprinted my tatler concerning mohocks or whalebone petticoats  now and then he may put up at the desire of several persons of quality of the highchurch party will be presented my tatler about atheists and immoralists or at the desire of the kitcat club will be shown my letter to a certain lord reading a penny and no money to be returned after the first paragraph is read    a all this is very pretty but really sir these trifles are not for senators no we shall hear from mr ironsides in another manner  mr ironsides first speech in parliament come a halfpenny a piece  or else perhaps mr ironsides dying speech with a full account of all those jacobites who passed sentence against him   t that is as it shall happen but if they dont turn him out woe be to them for he is about qualifying himself in such a manner as will soon make him terrible   a as how i pray you   t why it is said he will set out armed capapee that is sir he will have h  dns eloquence l  res modesty and w  les honesty if so beware of ironsides   a slife man if this be true he must to the tower right or wrong or what will become of the present ministry but more especially what will become of the lord and his fool   t i know not that but assure you he shall have my consent to stay in and more than that you shall see i will take leave of him in a very genteel manner and whatever i may have shown him to be in this dialogue i will allow him to be as follows  if this will not suffice let him give the challenge as soon as he shall make himself ready and have at him at comedy tragedy panegyric songs epigrams elegys catos ballads and lampoons a clear stage and no quarter   to mr ironsides twas you who first did put to flight the amber cane of sauntring knight the shoulderknot the hat and feather and rocklowe worn in sultry weather that spec was you or part of you which first subdued the redheeld shoe the snuff box too with nun and priest the fluttering coxcombs nauseous jest the only object that could suit the delicate and wellbred brute to playhouse whensoere you came to spec to censure and reclaim the guilty chloe curtsyd low the fop his tributary bow submissive paid and strait would be demure as if he came to see to vice from folly you could step or rather if you please could leap nor atheist then that is freethinker nor for the sake of rhyme freedrinker nor others tedious to rehearse below the dignity of verse however disguised in virtues shape specs guiltpursuing pen could escape great was the dread all fell before ye tam fool quam knave tam whig quam tory in vain the rich your doors would crowd no safeguard money was allowed the town and you did long wage war that is twas long fight dog fight bear but you at last did overcome and brought the eternal laurel home great was the glory then i trow as great as that of marlborough nor did you rid us of a lesser evil he beat the bourbon you the devil finis
