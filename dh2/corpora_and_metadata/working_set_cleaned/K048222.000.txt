leagues of saragossa  the birthday act i an apartment in don leopolds castle enter prince and frederick prince so at last we are arrived in don leopolds castle   fred thank heaven for since we turned our horses heads from the palace of saragosa my prince has not till this moment honored his faithful frederick with a single word   prince i did imagine my dear frederick that you wished to see me in love   fred without doubt  the darling of your royal patents the idol of the people the blooming hope of every friend to his country and the impending terror of her soes adorned with every grace of nature shining in each accomplishment with all the glowing spirit of a hero ready to burst into action i saw my prince my master in the midst of a brilliant court surrounded with pleasures but a stranger to happiness   prince it is true frederick i was amused but never pleased   fred i saw it i dared impelled by duty to pry into my princes thoughts and from the state of your heart this languor this apathy this restless joyless inquietude i plainly saw that in the midst of splendour love was wanting to make you happy   prince ay frederick but if this love which you imagine so essential to my happiness should plunge me into unutterable woe and render me for ever miserable   fred love make a prince miserable impossible   prince why not a prince as well as another man   fred heir to the crown of arragon who has only to ask and obtain to wish and be happy   prince ay fredrick but i would have the fair one love me not as the heir of arragon i would owe nothing to the dignity of my station   fred well sir fortune has arrangd each circumstance of your adventure here to the full extent of your wishes chance throws into your hands a ladys picture the features are just what your fancy imagines to be the most beautiful in the world and for seven or eight days by your orders i searched the court the city the country for the charming original my endeavors proved fruitless and you begin to despair of ever finding this lovely incognita when one day in hunting led by the ardour of the chase having strayed from your suite you find yourself near the park walls of this castle  hear the cry of distress see women pursued by a huge and fierce boar fired with a generous alarm at their danger you fly to their assistance to kill this monster was but the work of a minute but what a minute of delight of transport a young lady from weariness and fright having fallen at the foot of a tree presents to your eyes the very identical lovely original of the picture thus in saving her life your first interview was the most auspicious moment of yours   prince i own my dear frederick hitherto i have reason to be content as yet it is certain my quality is a secret to don leopold and hisdaughter and as i was first introduced to them by your name they still imagine me to be don frederick the amiable seraphina listens to my vows with the most flattering complacency approves my passion answers each gentle sigh each tender look with the sweet sympathy of dear affection and by her permission i made a formal demand to her father of her hand in marriage   fred which he readily granted not knowing you to be the prince of arragon   prince the old gentleman did not hesitate a moment and this very day the anniversary of my birth day don leopold has fixed for the celebration of our marriage   fred then nothing but the joy of the night can exceed the happiness of the day   prince ah frederick this day may be most unhappy seraphina loves me but before i wed her i am resolved to put her affection to the proof if it cannot bear the trial oh frederick what a severe stroke to a heart so tender so sensible so passionate as mine   fred well my lord i hope all for the best  ha ha ha i am diverted even at the idea of don leopolds surprise and embarrassment when he finds that youre the prince i assure you he will entertain you with such things as never yet reached a royal ear   prince ay that i suppose for the character of my old don thorough is noble free and independent hush here he comes remember i am don frederick and you are my attendant  exit fred

tell you what boy i have as much respect for my prince as you i obey i esteem i love him and were there a cause the last drop of my blood should write my loyalty i would die to serve him but i dont like new acquaintance i am too old   prince and yet i will assure you don leopold the prince wishes for nothing more than to have you nearly attached to him   leop me on what account   prince to have in your rare and valuable character a man of candor and probity incapable of falsehood on whose honor whose friendship he might rely and place an entire confidence in his fidelity  you laugh   leop

welcome go when you please   leop will you first answer for my going for go i will not no no he sees bad company enough already   prince but    leop none of your buts you are going to be my soninlaw take it once for all i was never made for a courtier i am a fantastical ridiculous old fellow that thinks noble birth wants no decoration of title that a star upon a breast cannot give honor to a heart that is base nor a ribbon dignity to a neck that perhaps deserves a halter though i live at a great expense i keep within my income i have not use for more than half the servants i maintain but then the other half i consider have use for me and though i am a lord i am as free from debt as the poorest commoner   prince you would indeed be an extraordinary character at court   leop ay ay don frederick but i prefer being lodged in this old castle of mine here to the honor of being inconveniently situated near a prince in one word i would rather walk about my park gardens and my own improvements than to slide and amble through an antichamber like a cipher of great importance in a groupe of idle busybodies female profligates reverend atheists mock patriots and right honorable sharpers the whole forming a villainous picture a curious court calendar   prince then it is impossible to persuade you to accompany us   leop then dont attempt ask a lover to resign his mistress a

apart to frederick prince frederick i doubt her constancy but desire my attendants to be in readiness  exit frederick sera it is indeed mine the very picture that my father had drawn about a month after my return from the convent and that he lost a few days after   prince and which fortune has thrown into the hands of the prince but instead of repaying his confidence with fidelity instead of throwing myself at his feet and confessing that i was his rival i endeavored to conceal my embarrassment and turn his passion aside with a forced laugh i affected to rally his love for a person unknown and to cool his transport urged that the picture might have flattered that the original might not be living that those fine features perhaps never existed but in the painters fancy in short my perfidious jealousy left nothing unsaid that might prevent his curiosity from any further attempt to discover you   flori aside you had little to do i think   prince mad with the fear of having my treasure snatched from me i flew to your father and urged him to hasten our marriage i summoned all my dissimulation to master my anxiety before him but when i approached your presence that unsuspecting innocence that air of frankness and sincerity even triumphed over your charms the tender and ingenuous joy you expressed at seeing me when heaven itself had designed you for a throne confounded my intentions i had no longer power to disguise the cruel conflict that agitated my soul you lovely seraphina perceived my emotions your kind solicitude has produced this explanation there now remains no more for me but to quit your presence and for ever banish from your sight my shame my guilt and my confusion   flori ay do go along and send the prince to us  aside enter frederick fred
