the messiah erastus and eugenius erast in one of our conferences i think i told you see page    indeed the whole of discourse iii should be read and well understood before this sketch of sacred history is studied as indeed should discourses vii viii ix and x before the view of english history that all mankind from adam until now have received the benefits of the death and passion of our redeemer of course our religion has been the same from the beginning of the world men have ever acknowledged the same god as the creator and the same christ as the savior of the world but this acknowledgment was not sufficient to save mankind before the coming of our savior men found it necessary to practice natural religion before the introduction of revealed that is to say to submit to the principles of right and equity which god had engraved upon their hearts before he thought proper to give them any directions on that head they did as they would be done by and acted in conformity to conscience and to reason such was the religion of adam and his posterity to render it however more venerable and testify their dependence on the sovereign majesty of god they made use of ceremonies and an outward form of worship they erected altars and sacrificed on those altars certain animals and fruits of the earth as emblematical of the great sacrifice of jesus christ in aftertimes then the distinction of priest and people was unknown till the time the moses all men were priests and very one offered to the lord the humble homage of his dependence and his gratitude   eugen the history of the first families on earth must be very interesting i should like to know something of them   erast i will endeavor to gratify you in this particular shall not however enter minutely into every little incident attendant on this history i shall give you only the great outlines of the progress of that religion which it pleased the creator to establish among men to assist your memory in this it will be necessary to divide the time into six periods that you may not confound one age with another  the first period then shall contain a view of the principal events that occurred from the creation of the world to the deluge or it is destruction by water  the second shall give you an idea of the history of mankind from the deluge to the calling of abraham who was the father of the jewish nation  the third will show you the progress of the jews to their entrance into the land of canaan the land which god allotted for their inheritance  the fourth will lay before you the various revolutions that took place in this rising nation to the time of their most flourishing state when solomon built his temple  the fifth shall begin with the captivity of babylon whose people merited slavery by their crimes and  the sixth will represent to you the state of the same people from the time they recovered their freedom under the reign of cyrus king of persia till the birth of christ   the first epoch   the first then of the six epochs or periods is that which begins with the world and ends with the deluge and comprehends the occurrences of      years that is to say from adam to noah  not long after the fall of our first parents they had two sons cain and abel the dispositions of these two brothers were of a contrary cast cain was of an avaricious proud impious turn of mind whereas abel was all meekness humility and generosity now as the sacrifices or homage offered to god by the one was more acceptable to him than those of the other it occasioned such a jealousy and hatred in cain that he sought an opportunity to murder his brother  the death of abel armed the vengeance of the lord against his murderer and god to punish him gave him over to the bitterest remorse a mans conscience when keen is a sufficient punishment for almost any crime to this conscience cain was committed and we are told that his sin so afflicted him that it was more than he was able to bear he was driven out from society and thus agitated by his fears sat about building the first city as an asylum from the hatred and persecution of mankind  adam was consoled for the loss of abel and the depravity of cain by the birth of seth who was the second patriarch or head of a family before the deluge  the family of this man was virtuous and religious whilst that of cain was the contrary and it was not till the time of enos the third patriarch and son of seth that the true worship of god took place in the family of cain this was about     years after the creation  the great greatgrandson of enos was enoch the father of methuselah he who was the longest liver and died at the age of     this enoch was taken up into heaven in a miraculous manner soon after the death of adam who dying at the age of   0 plunged mankind into a general nourning  the death of adam the taking up of enoch and the old age of the other patriarchs who till now seemed to have kept men within certain bounds gave a loose to universal corruption nothing could check it the virtuous fell in with the depravity of the vicious in a word impiety grew to such an excess that god in equity of judgment determined to extirpate this criminal race of men from the earth  among the whole there was only one good man this was the patriarch noah the grandson of methusaleh and of the tenth generation from adam by his son seth him god was pleased to favor and reveal to his design of destroying the world by an universal deluge and that   0 years before it happened in order to save this man and his family he directed him to build a large vessel which we call an ark  during this interval noah denounced to sinners the terrible event that threatened them but they shut their ears to his salutary admonitions and laughed at the dreadful account he held forth to them till the horrible event took place noah alone his wife his three sons and their wives with a male and female of every animal then living were reserved to repeople and restock the earth this happened in the year of the world      when noah was about  00 years old  eugen i have heard the long lives of people living before the flood disputed and that that which we call a year was a period of much shorter duration   erast such things have been advanced but merely on conjecture in the early ages of the world when families on the earth were few it was perhaps necessary or at least not attended with any inconvenience that men should live and beget children for eight or nine hundred years in order to people the globe but was mankind to live now as long it is evident from the populousness of every country that the earth would be overstocked and not large enough to provide for mankind on this account providence has wisely shortened our days and ordered that there shall be no more inhabitants than the earth is capable of maintaining besides god might then have thought proper to extend the lives of men to a very great age in order to hand down to posterity the wonders of his power and his goodness which as printing was then unknown could not be otherwise done than by tradition  the ten patriarchs that lived before the flood namely adam seth enos cainan mahalaleel jared enoch methuselah lamech and noah each of which was the son of the person preceding him were the depositaries of the holy law before it was published on mount sinai and of these ten adam lived    years after lamech was born and lamech lived till noah was     years old that is till within six years of the deluge and as noah lived   0 years afterward it is plain that the history of above  000 years was within the memory of three persons the accounts given therefore by these three men corroborating the assertions of the other seven patriarchs leave no room to doubt the veracity of their traditions  so again of the ten patriarchs after the flood shem the first patriarch the son of noah lived   0 years after the birth of abraham the tenth patriarch whose son isaac was a cotemporay to levi the father or grandfather of moses hence it follows that moses wrote nothing but that was in the memory of man since he was not more than four or five generations removed from abraham and abraham being alive with many who had seen noah and the deluge and noah with many that had seen adam and the first ages of the world it follows that adam could not be unknown to noah and his son shem nor these to abraham or jacob nor jacob to moses particularly at a time when this tradition concerned their own family and was the only history fathers could teach their children   eugen i have followed you sir with attention and see clearly that the history of the first ages of the world have passed through too few hands to be altered in the days of moses not more than seven or eight persons from adams to moses a period of near   00 years  but sir there is a new difficulty which strikes me and which i wish to have cleared up and that is how so great a multitude of animals as two of each species which covered the earth could be contained in the ark so long as a year which i understand the deluge continued   erast in the first place it must be considered that according to the dimensions of the ark given us in scripture it was four times as large as a firstrate man of war which is capable of containing seven or eight hundred men with as many troops with necessary provisions for six months and at the same time loaded with rigging one hundred pieces of heavy cannon and their proper ammunition whereas in the ark were only eight persons besides the animals and their provisions for a year  in the next place it must be understood that the original species of animals were not so numerous as have been thought all the species of dogs for example may have arisen from one species as all the species of pears may have sprung from the first pear tree or the different species of men from the same original   eugen but sir is it natural to conclude that men of different complexions white swarthy coppercoloured and black sprung from the same stock   erast yes our exterior varieties are subject to change we no way resemble the ancient britons of this country this race of people has ceased by mixing with others the arabians who lived a long time in spain and who were originally of a black cast have now retired to morocco and tunis the natives of the western part of africa are blacker than they formerly were those about tunis whiter where there is no mixture of people the same color has continued but one alteration is sufficient to destroy our conclusions that men of different complexions must spring from different stocks  no animal produced by two animals of a different kind ever breeds that is mongrels never perpetuate their species but a bitch produced by a greyhound and a terrier will have young of course a greyhound and a terrier are in fact of the same species we may say the same of a child born of a negrowoman and a white man but let us continue the history of religion   the second epoch soon after the deluge change of living and animal food being substituted in the room of vegetable with other causes brought on a decrease in length of life some precepts were given to noah the confusion of tongues happened at the tower of babel in the year of the world      which was the first monument of the pride and wickedness of men and the allotment of district to the three children of noah was the first distribution of land  an account of these first three founders of nations is still preserved from japhet the eldest son of noah sprung the inhabitants of the north of europe and asia as well as those of the west from shem came the people of the east as also the jews and from ham and his son canaan descended the canaanites philistines egyptians and the ancient possessors of africa  a little after this first division of territory that is about      of the world nimrod a man of savage disposition became the first of conquerors and established his kingdom at babylon he was the father of ninus who founded the assyrian monarchy  every thing had a beginning there is no history so ancient that has not vestiges of the infancy of the world we have seen laws established manners become polished and empires formed men have risen by degrees from a state of ignorance experience has improved them and arts have multiplied and grown to perfection under their hands in proportion as mankind increased mountains were passed rivers and seas were traversed and new habitations were established  the earth which in the beginning was merely an immense forest took on a new form woods grubbed up gave place to fields to meadows to villages and towns men employed themselves in taking animals taming them and making them useful meeting with opposition they first began their contest with wild beasts they next invented arms then turned those arms against each other and took pride in war nimrod the first warrior and the first conqueror is called in scripture a great hunter afterward men found out the art of cultivation converted metals to their use and turned every article in nature to some advantage  but though men enriched society by the invention and improvement of arts they on the other hand dishonored it by the greatest excesses till in the end they drew upon them the vengeance of the lord in vain did the world still dripping as it were with the waters of the deluge in vain did the striking decrease in the duration of human life in vain did the overthrow of nature still present dreadful monuments of the justice of an irritated creator the knowledge of a supreme being was effaced from the memory of man ancient traditions were obscured and forgotten and fables took their place instead of paying that tribute of adoration to the mosthigh which was due from all that breathed they prostituted a sacrilegious incense to animals and by an inconceivable depravity even kings fell down before them and worshipped them scarce was found a family faithful to the god of adam and of noah insomuch that the father of nature weary of threatening waiting and punishing abandoned mankind and left them to their perverseness  such was the unhappy progress of sin in the short space of     years the duration of this second epoch  eugen what became then sir of the true religion did god in anger deprive men of it   erast no the word of the lord is irrevocable and the certain effect always follows his promise had he attended only to the sin of our forefathers he would doubtless have destroyed that wicked race but his mercy kept pace with his justice and a prospect of the future merits of the redeemer which he had announced to the world called back his clemency and induced him to forbearance   the third epoch in the midst of these crimes which sullied the world god ever watchful for the preservation of religion perceived one just man of the family of shem and through him determined to separate the true worshippers from the rest of mankind this was abraham and he was chosen to be the stock and father of the faithful this was in the year of the world   0   the mosthigh called him into a country inhabited by the posterity of canaan determining to establish there his worship and the children of this patriarch whom he had resolved to multiply as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the sea to the promise he made him of giving this land to his descendants he added a more illustrious good namely that great blessing he bestowed through him on all the human race for of abrahams family jesus christ was born  from jacob the grandson of abraham and whom isaac his father blessed in preference to his elder brother esau thus executing the will of god though he was apparently deceived into it sprang the israelites or jews so called from israel the name given him from his wrestling with an angel in the year of the world       after the death of jacob whose son joseph had made such a figure in the court of pharaoh king of egypt and the administration of his government the house of abraham became a great people and multiplied so prodigiously as to excite the jealousy of the egyptians the israelites or hebrews faithful to their god were in the very center of the most monstrous and absurd idolatry unjustly hated and unmercifully persecuted but the lord raised up moses as their protector and deliverer having saved him from the waters of the nile where by an order of the king all the male children of the israelites were thrown with a design to defeat a prophecy that one should then be born that should rescue the israelites from their servitude from the waters of the nile to which moses then an infant was committed in the year of the world      he fell under the notice of pharaohs daughter there walking who rescued him from a watery grave and brought him up as her own son  for forty years moses despised the riches of the court of egypt and moved with the distresses of his brother israelites whom pharaoh continued to persecute combated every danger to comfort them but they far from profiting by his zeal and his resolution exposed themselves to the fury of pharaoh who was determined on their ruin moses saved himself by flight he fled into arabia where he passed forty years as a shepherd at the end of which time he saw the burning bush from the midst of which god spoke to him and directed him to return to egypt and free his brethren from their slavery  the pains he took to effect this his remonstrances with pharaoh his punishment of that king by bringing on his country the many plagues it endured his conducting the israelites across the red sea where the water miraculously divided to the right and left to suffer them to pass through and united again to drown pharaoh and all his host attempting to follow them in order to force them back you are too well acquainted with to need a repetition here all that is necessary to know is that moses through the interference of god became the deliverer of the jewish nation after more than two ages of servitude and   0 years after the calling of abraham this was in the year of the world      or    0 years before the birth of christ  the fourth epoch god having freed his people from the tyranny of the egyptians to conduct them to a land which he had promised to their father laid down the law which he would have them to follow  in the journey of these israelites in number  00000 besides old men women and children god provided for them miraculously he rained down manna a kind of bread from heaven and water gushed out from rocks at the command of their leader nor did their clothes wear out but fitted them and their children during their whole journey which took up the space of forty years  they no sooner had passed the red sea and were free from the pursuit of the egyptians than god directed moses to ascend mount sinai occasionally the israelites continuing at the foot of itwhere he delivered into his hands two tables of stone on which he had engraved the decalogue or ten commandments and at times gave him such other instructions as he thought necessary this decalogue was by no means a new law but that which god had written in the hearts of all men long before it containing only the first principles of mans duty to god and to his neighbor his renewal of this law and giving it in writing was because the ignorance and passions of men had almost effaced it from their memory in one of his visits to the top of sinai he continued forty days during which the israelites murmured and fancying moses had deserted them made a golden calf and fell down and worshipped it moses on his return to punish the guilty called the children of levi and ordered them to put the idolaters to death which they did to the number of three thousand  after god had delivered the commandments to moses he gave him other precepts which he was to consider as an explanation of the written law he ordered him to build a temple or tabernacle to deposit this law in to erect an altar and stablish a priesthood to this office moses appointed his brother aaron thus did god establish ceremonies and an outward form of worship and the levites the grandchildren of jacob by their father levi were consecrated to serve at the altars  after these great establishments they pursued their journey into the deserts of arabia before the completion of which moses died and god appointed joshua his successor who ordered this history which moses had begun to be continued  eugen and where is this history to be found   erast the hisory which moses wrote is contained in the five books of genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy called the pentateuch and which comprize the institution of religion genesis contains the history of the world from the creation to the death of joseph a space of      years exodus comprehends the history of the jews from the death of joseph to the building of the tabernacle an interval of     years leviticus unfolds the administration of the levites moses here treats of the ceremonies of the jewish religion the different sorts of sacrifices and other things in numbers we have what happened to gods people in the space of six weeks only in deuteronomy moses gives a recapitulation of the law to those whose fathers died in passing the deserts and relates every thing that happened from their leaving egypt till that time the subsequent books continued by order of joshua are the book of joshua the books of judges samuel and of the kings  after the death fo moses god multiplied his favors upon his chosen people docile to the voice of joshua as the red sea had divided in obedience to the command of moses the river jordan divided and presented them a passage also every thing fled at the approach of the hebrew general all opposition fell before him and the land of canaan became the property of these new comers ramparts of towns fell miraculously at the sound of their trumpets the sum supended his course to enable them to complete their victories and the powerful hand of the master of nature was seen in every step they took   eugen without the interfering hand of providence it would have been impossible to have conducted on so great a multitude of people through so many difficulties and for such a length of time   erast you reason right god you see did interfere he compelled pharaoh to let his people go by repeated plagues or punishments on his country he opened a passage for them through the red sea destroyed their pursuers showed himself to them on mount sinai gave them a written law put to death those who revolted fed and clothed them miraculously cleared the way before them fought their battles made the earth open and swallow up the mutineers and brought them almost in spite of themselves and the combined forces of the neighboring states to the land he had promised to their ancestor abraham   eugen how awfully wonderful is god in all his works   erast when they reached canaan after a war of six years almost all the promised land acknowledged the laws of the children of jacob divided among them by the direction of joshua it was divided into twelve provinces according to the number of the tribes the tribe of levi indeed had no part in the division because god would have the levites spread among all the tribes that by their example and advice they might keep up a spirit of religion among their brethren and preserve the worship of the true god as a remembrane of his goodness  the following table with show you the succession of the patriarchs and from whom they sprung each man below being the son of the one above him   before the flood a space of      years   adam created  00  before christ died   0   seth third son of adam born      before christ died aged       enos born      before christ died aged  0    cainan born      before christ died aged   0   mahalaleel born   0  before

 died      before christ    nahor born      died  00  before christ    terah born      before christ died aged      0 abraham born      before christ died aged     now from abraham through king david in a right line sprung joseph the husband of mary the mother of our savior david was a lineal descendant of abraham fourteen generations removed and joseph twentyseven generations removed from david so that christ was only sixty generations from father to son removed from adam this family from abraham is traced in the first chapter of the gospel of saint matthew  after the death of joshua which happened soon after the establishment of the israelites in the land of canaan things went pretty smoothly on for a number of years at times they forgot the goodness of god to them and allied themselves to their idolatrous neighbors the consequence of which was the lord threw them again into bondage as often as they returned to their duty the lord was their friend and deliverer and whenever they failed in that duty they became slaves to some sovereign power in this state they continued with very little alteration till the end of the fourth epoch and the reign of solomon son of david their king   0 years after their departure from egypt and  0   years before the birth of christ  the fifth epoch after the death of solomon which happened     years before christ the israelites dissembled and chose rehoboam the son of solomon their king but the people under jeroboam applying to him for the redress of some grievances and being harshly denied ten of the tribes revolted and set up jeroboam as king of israel whilst rehoboam reigned over the tribes of judah and benjamin who preserved the religion of moses and continued in the faith of abraham to these the levites joined themselves this faction or division of the kingdom of israel lasted     years  the reign of jeroboam and his successors were however troubled he experienced the displeasure of heaven whilst those of judah were particularly patronized the revolving tribes felt the severe effects of war and famine so that mothers were reduced even to the necessity of feeding upon their own children and were delivered over to e tyranny and persecution of their enemies they were ansported to nineveh and mixed with other nations hereas the other tribes continued under kings of the ouse of david and were under the immediate protection f the mosthigh and one time in particular being esieged in jerusalem by sennacherib king of assyria the lord fought their cause and by an angel in one night lew    000 of the assyrian army this was foretold y the prophet isaiah some time before  the people of judah however fell like those of israel into idolatry and became in their turn a prey to the assyrian monarchy being taken by nebuchadnezzar then king of babylon who destroyed the city of jerusalem and said waste the magnificent temple which solomon had built  eugen how many years was this after the discontinuance of the kingdom of israel   erast one hundred and thirtyfour years and     after the revolt of the ten tribes isaiah who predicted the fall of jerusalem foretold also it is glorious reestablishment under cyrus  00 years before it happened jeremiah who pointed out the certain ruin of this ungrateful people told them however that their thraldom would continue only seventy years  babylon was triumphant but her affairs became afterward disordered and the period marked by the prophets for the reestablishment of juda arrived amidst these troubles cyrus appeared at the head of the medes and persians every thing gave way to this formidable conqueror and the jews once more recovered their freedom they were permitted to return to their own country and directed to rebuild the temple of jerusalem with the utmost expedition the number that returned amounted to      0 besides proselytes menservants and maidservants to the number of         the sixth epoch it was zorobabel of the tribe of juda and of the blood royal who brought back the captives the temple was rebuilt the walls of jerusalem new raised and the people of israel enjoyed a profound peace under the kings of the persia  eugen is there no other book in which the history of the jews is related but the holy bible   erast we have it there that is in the bible upon the most unquestionable authority but this history is also related in the works of josephus a learned jew who wrote soon after the death of our savior that is in the year  0  this peace however was in some measure interrupted by alexander the great about     years before christ who passing out of europe laid waste the persian empire being on the march to jerusalem in order to besiege it the high priest put on his priestly habit and with a great number of people clothed in vestments went out to meet him as soon as alexander saw the high priest he fell prostrate before him saying that whilst he was in macedonia a man appeared to him in the very same habit and invited him into asia promising to deliver the persian empire into his hands and the high priest showing him the prophecy of daniel that a grecian should come and destroy the persians he was confirmed in the persuasion that he himself was the man this led him to respect the temple he designed to pillage and destroy and to support the jews in their privileges in short he subdued the persians darius was slain and alexander became universal monarch over the eastern world  it was about this time that is about     years before christ that seventy jews distinguished for their learning were employed by ptolemy king of egypt with consent of the nation to translate the bible from its original hebrew into greek it is from these called the septuagint translation hence the jewish religion began to be the known among the gentiles the temple of jerusalem was enriched with gifts both from kings and people and the jews were respected every where  allured by the treasures within the temple seleucus king of syria sent a person to bring it away this man was struck down by angels and almost killed but at the prayers of the high priest soon after recovered  antiochus however who succeeded seleucus on the throne of syria conceived a design of destroying the jewish nation and dividing it is wealth among his own people he succeeded in his enterprise sacked the city slew  0000 of the inhabitants took as many prisoners pillaged the temple and endeavored to abolish the worship of god  matthias and his son judas maccabeus opposed the violence of this tyrant and with a handful of soldiers performed wonders destroyed the army of antiochus and purified the temple three years and an half after it is prosanation   eugen this surely was an interference of the almighty   erast it certainly was antiochus soon after died a miserable death he was suddenly siezed wiht a general putrefaction so as to breed worms in all parts of him and on his deathbed he admitted this to be a punishment for the injury he had done to jerusalem  after this the jews became a flourishing nation and continued so with but few alterations or changes till about  0 years before the birth of chrish when pompey the roman general disspossessed antiochus the last king of syria took jerusalem and made the jews tributary to the romans  the romans now being absolute masters of this whole country herodan idumean was by them appointed king of judea and it was in herods reign that jesus christ was born  00  years after the creation of the world   eugen what wonderful revolutions and changes have happened to one single nation and how uniformly did god continue to support his chosen people and carry on the cause of his religion   a cursory view of english history discourse i erast having given you my dear eugenius some account of sacred history i will now endeavor to give you some light into that of our own country   eugen you will find me all attention   erast the history of england may be divided into three periods the first from the commencement of our knowledge of this country to it is conquest by the normans the second from that conquest to the alteration of the constitution by the beheading of king charles and the last from king charless death to the present time  before the romans entered this island which was fifty four years before the birth of christ the country was populous and stored with great plenty of animals savage and domestic towns were few and house were meanly built and scattered up and down the ancient britons lived upon milk and flesh procured by hunting and went almost naked painting their bodies with different colors the only garments they wore were the skins of beasts thrown over their shoulders and another round their waists   eugen had they no sort of government among them   erast what government they had consisted of petty principalities who united in cases of common danger and chose a leader by general consent in short the people were little better than savages   eugen had they no religion among them   erast they had a fraternity among them known by the name of druids who were majestrates as well as priests and who taught a morality which principally consisited in justice ce and fortitude they lived in woods and caverns and ollow trees and their food was acorns and wild berries it was in the spirit of conquest that julius caesar invaded his country from gaul now france in order to add it o the roman territories he appeared off the coast of ussex and though the britons made the bravest oposition ade good his landing and in a very littel time completed is conquest for the british forces laid down their arms and acknowledged the roman power julius caesar made o long stay in this island but having laid the britons under tribute returned to gaul  the second expedition of the romans into britain was ander claudius in the year  0 caractacus their king made a brave defense but was at last defeated and taken prisoner from this time the romans continued in britain and mixed with the natives but their troubles at home obliging the roman emperor to call back his forces from this country in the year   0 the britons were once more lest to themselves and such were the dissensions of this people among themselves that forty years afterward they were driven to the necessity of applying to the romans for reief against the inroads of the picts and scots   eugen who were these picts   erast they were part of the natives of britain who had been driven by the romans into the north of england and who were always ravaging the southern parts whenever they had an opportunity   eugen did the romans afford them any succor   erast none they were too much engaged in quieting hostilities in their own country to think of a people at so great a distance the consequence of which was that the britons invited over the saxons who were then settled in germany   eugen were the saxons as savage as the britons   erast no the saxons were a more polished people but not so refined as the romans and they dressed with a degree of elegance  the women wore linen garments trimmed and striped with purple and their hair fell in ringlets on their shoulders no part of their bodies was exposed to the weather but their faces their arms and their bosoms   eugen did the saxons come over   erast on this invitation in the year     great numbers came to the assistance of the britons with hengift and horsa two brothers at their head they marched in conjunction with the british arms against the picts and obliged them to retire into scotland and finding themselves very powerful sent over for more forces turned their arms upon the britons and in one century subdued all england and established here seven different kindgoms known by the name of the saxon heptarchy this took place about       eugen what became of the britons after this   erast many went over to france and settled in that part now called britany many of the fell in a variety of engagements many were massacred and the few of spirit that remained to escape the fury of their conquerors retired to the mountainous parts of wales and cornwall such as chose to continue among the saxons became slaves to this people turning their hands to agriculture and holding their lands at the will and pleasure of their landlords the children of these miserable britons belonged to the soil they tilled like the rest of the stock or cattle on it and were the property of their owners   eugen i presame this is what is understood by villenage   erast it is a horrid custom originally borrowed from the romans and adopted by the saxons by vicious imitation  the saxons now finding no enemies to subdue began to fight with each other the princes of the seven kingdoms which they had erected namely kent south west and east saxony northumberland east angles and mercia began mutually to rival and envy each other and for the space of above  00 years all the misery that ambition treachery or war could bring upon a kingdom was the consequence of their animosity till at last in the year  00 egbert descended from the west saxon kings partly by conquest and partly by inheritance became he first sole monarch of england the seven kingdoms being in him united into one   eugen it was called england then at that time   erast it then first took this name to distinguish it from the principality of wales still possessed by the ancient britons and from that part now called scotland possessed by the picts and scots  no customs truly british or roman were now to be seen the language of the country which had been either latin or celtic was discontinued and the saxon that is english only was spoken the kingdom was divided into counties or shires and the english if compared to the naked britons at the invasion of caesar might be considered as polite houses furniture clothes and other luxuries were as general then as at present they were only incapable of sentimental pleasure all the learning of the times was centred in the clergy who were overrun with ignorance and superstition   eugen christianity i presume had not found a footing here  austin the monk had been sent over by the pope in     in order to preach christianity and was made the first archbishop of canterbury he made many converts but this little improved their manners  egbert was scarce settled on his throne than the whole kingdom was alarmed by the approach of an unexpected enemy a swarm of those nations that possessed the countries bordering on the baltic began under the names of danes and normans to infest the western coasts of europe plundering those very people who some centuries before had invaded the places where they were now settled and driven out the inhabitants the normans fell upon the northern coasts of france the danes on the southern parts of england  a d     the people of this island had been too much exhausted in civil war to make much opposition some battles were fought but the danes kept their footing fortified posts and passages and built castles for their defense of which there are many remains at this day   eugen how did the saxons relish this   erast the danes and saxons were originally from the same country of course their similitude of language laws and manners soon produced an intercourse between both nations and though they were still enemies the danes gradually mingled with the people of england and submitted to it is government   eugen were they of the same religion   erast no the english were christians and the danes pagans of course though the english in some measure admitted them yet they secretly hated them this produced frequent contensts and frequently laid the country in blood  in this period of cruelty jealousy and desolation a man seemed raised up to defend the rights of his bleeding country and improve the age in which he lived this was alfred the fourth son of ethelwolf king of england and grandson of egbert who on the death of his brother ethelred was called to the english crown of which he was put into possession only nominally the country being overrun by the danes  his reign began with wars and his first battles were fought with succeess but being at length overpowered he was obliged to save himself by flight he retired to the cottage of a cowherd in somersetshire and lived six months there as a servant no one being privy to this retreat of his but his friend the earl of devonshire   eugen what set him on the throne again   erast a fortunate victory over the danes by the earl of devonshire  not knowing how to get at the strenght of the enemy alfred disguised himself as a shepherd and traversed the danish camp with a harp and as he excelled on this instrument he soon got access to the danish generals finding they were divided among themselves he seized the favorable opportunity flew to the earl of devonshire headed his troops forced their camp and gained a complete victory   eugen a very enterprising man   erast he soon by his address got himself acknowledged king by the danes he then besieged london and took it fitted out a fleet and repressed any further invasion to him we are indebted for many of our mildest laws r the art of building with brick and for the university of oxford which he founded the was an excellent histoian a good latin scholar and from his reign english hisory may be said to commence   eugen how long did he reign   erast he died in the year  00 aged fifty one after reign of more than twentyeight years and was succeeded by his second son edward in whose reign the university of cambridge was founded   eugen who succeeded edward   erast his natural son athelstan in     under whose auspices the bible was translated into saxon and the thristian religion gained ground his son edmund the first was his successor in     whose reign is no otherwise remarkable than by his instituting the first capital punishment having ordained that in gangs of robbers when taken the oldest should be hanged he lost his life in a very extraordinary manner after a reign of seven years solemnizing a festival in gloucestershire and observing a fellow who had been banished the kingdom for his crimes fitting at one of the tables in the hall where he dined he was so offended at his insolence that he ordered him to be apprehended and perceiving the villain drawing a dagger in order to defend himself the king started up and catching him by the hair dragged him our of the hall but in doing this he met his death for the ruffian in the scuffle stabbed him to the heart  edred his brother succeeded him and was so weak a prince that under him the monks gained great influence and had the chief direction of affairs he died in     left several sons but being very young they were set aside and edwy his eldest brothers son was placed on the throne at this time the crown appears to have been elective and those elections wholly influenced by the clergy the english during this short reign were divided by religious disputes and involved in civil war whilst the danes were increasing in strength and sending over for fresh forces   eugen what do you mean by civil war   erest a war at home among ourselves one pa of the people fighting with the other edred was elected king by the secular priests but the monks in     dethroned him and placed his brother edgar in his room   eugen england is said then to have been exceedingly happy   erast happier than under any former one under this reign it is fleet amounted to upwards of four thousand ships foreign princes came to edgars court and returned without molestation music painting and poetry were held as refined accomplishments and gallantry was the characteristic of the king it is related that he was enjoined by dunstan archbishop of canterbury not to wear his crown for seven years for having debauched a nun his amor with the beautiful elfrida is worth your attention   eugen pray let me hear it   erast she was the daughter of the earl of devonshire and edgar unwilling to credit the great report of her beauty sent ethelwolfe a friend to see her that he might be better satisfied designing if report spoke truth to pay his addresses to her this friend no sooner saw her than he became desperately in love with her and forgetting his errand made proposals to her himself his hand was accepted and they were privately married returning however to court and assuring the king that she was so far from handsome that he wondered the world could speak of her edgar thought no more of her sometime afterward he represented to the king that though the fortune of the earl of devonshires daughter would be trifting to a monarch yet it would be an immense sum to a needy subject and solicited his permission to pay his court to her edgar consenting ethelwolfe returned to his wife and their nuptials were publicly solemnized now though he had the precaution not to let her appear at court his treachery was not long concealed edgar was made acquainted with the whole but disembling his resentment took an opportunity of visiting the part of the country where she lived accompanied by his favorite when he was near the place he told him he had a curiosity to see his wife of whom he had a curiosity to see his wife of whom he had formerly ard so much ethelwolfe thunderstruck did all he could dissuade him but in vain all he could obtain was to  before under pretense of preparing her for the kings eption he then informed his wife of the steps he had en to be possessed of her charms and conjured her to nceal her beauty as much as possible elfrida promised mpliance but prompted either by vanity or revenge set rself off to the best advantage the king no sooner saw r but was smitten and was instantly resolved to have r he took his leave however with a seeming indifferce ethelwolfe was soon after sent to northumberland a pretense of urgent affairs and in his journey was urdered in a wood by the kings command who took frida to court and married her edgar however was aced among the number of the saints by the monks o have written his history  ladies you see were admitted to court in this early ped but polite as the age seems to have been there was ll a degree of savage barbarity among the people  he defects of edgars government fell upon his successors e power of the monks increased and that of the state tened in proportion edgar died in     and was suceded by his son edward the martyr so called because ur years afterward at the age of    he fell a sacrifice  the ambition of his stepmother elfrida who ordered m to be stabbed to make way for her own son etheld ii son also of edgar who was crowned in his stead  the danes now becoming exceedingly troublesome and helred finding himself unable to oppose them comunded with them for his safety but soon after strengthed by an alliance with the duke of normandy and ich was the first connection with that family he laid a testable scheme to massacre all the danes throughout e kingdom the plot was carried into execution and ost of them were destroyed in one day this was in e year  00   suenon king of denmark exasperated at this slaugh of his countrymen soon landed in england filled the untry with blood and obliged ethelred to fly to normandy suenon was proclaimed king and soon af dying his son canute was proclaimed but being oblig to go back to denmark the english in his absence call back their banished monarch but he could never recov his crown canute still held it and died here king  england denmark and norway in  0    this natural son harold i succeeded him by force  arms and in order to extirpate the english royal famil forged a letter from emma the widow of ethelred  and afterward wife of his father canute to her sons a fred and edward ethelreds children who had fled normandy inviting them to england to take the crown when here he ordered alfreds eyes to be put out b edward escaped and was afterward king harold dyi in  0   was succeeded by his brother hardicanute king  denmark third son of canute by emma but he dy suddenly at a feast at lambeth in  0   was succeed  by his halfbrother edward who as i said before had fl to normandy with his brother alfred   eugen how long had the throne of england be in possession of the danish kings   erast thirty seven years but with the death  hradicanute expired not only the dominion of but  future attempts of invasion from the danes thou their ravages had continued for above two hundred yea yet they left no change of laws customs language or ligion the many castles they built and the many milies they left behind them served alone to discover  places of their establishment after the accession  edward to the crown the english and danes as if wried with mutual slaughter united in support of govement and peaceably living among each other form  ever after but one people  the reign of edward was long and happy he had li long in normandy and in some measure adopted the language and learning of that country it was by the terest of earl godwin that edward obtained the crow having married this noblemans daughter but having  children by her it led godwin to endeavor at establing his own son harold on the throne which on the de of edward he succeeded in but not without edwards having on his deathbed nominated william duke of normandy as his successor   eugen was not his edward the first king who pretended to cure the kings evil by touching the affected part   erast he was  and the superstituous ceremony continued to be practiced by the sovereigns of england till the reign of king george the first who wisely dropped it it was the sanctity of edward that gave rise to the belief of so extraordinary a cure and it was this his continence and his pretending to have the gift of prophecy that procured him a distinguished place amodg the saints he was called edward the confessor  on the death of edward in  0   harold the second the son of earl godwin took possession of the throne and with the consent of the people his brother tosti also put in a claim for it as elder brother but harold was in possession and though tosti procured assistance from norway and invaded england in the north it answered no purpose the invaders were defeated at the battle of standford and were obliged to retire but the joy of this victory was soon damped by the news that williams duke of normandy had landed at hastings in sussex with a great army determined to support his claim to the crown from the nomination of edward this happened sep     0     eugen who was this william   erast he was the natural son of robert duke of normandy by a tanners daughter harold returned from the north with all the forces he could muster and gave him battle on the   th day of october following at hastings william sent an offer to harold to decide the dispute by single combat and spare the effusion of the peoples blood but harold refused and said he would leave it to the determination of god numerous were the forces on both sides and great was the contest william had three horses killed under him and lost   000 men harold lost near  0000 he was as active and brave as man could be but was conquered after all making a furious onset at the head of his troops he was shot through the skull with an arrow and all the courage of the english died with him  this was the end of the saxon monarchy in england which had continued for more than six hundred years and closes the first period of the british history   discourse ii the same subject continued the second period erast to pursue now the thread of our history we will enter upon that part which gives birth to our present happy constitution those laws so much esteemed by the rest of europe and those liberties so dear to every englishman  immediately after the battle of hastings the conquero marched to london where the bishops and magistrate met him and offered him the crown numberless however were the insurrections of the people against their new monarch so that william though disposed to mildness was forced to pursue rigorous measures he had engaged to provide for those adventurers who accompanie him to england and as he was diffident of the english he removed them from all places of trust and confidence and gave them to his norman followers the english were deprived of arms and forbidden to have any light i their houses after eight oclock in the evening at which time a bell was rung called a curfew as a warning to pu their fire and candle out   eugen were there none of edwards family living t contest the crown   erast there was a son of edmund ii edward th martyrs brother called edgar atheling this young man was abroad when canute took possession of the crown his father edmund had been proclaimed king on th death of suenon king of denmark in  0   who had surped the english crown but was soon after murdered at oxford when canute had quiet possession of the throne this young man edgar atheling applied to the king f scotland for assistance and under his protection invadd england in the north william met their forces but nstead of a battle proposed a negotiation edgar resigned is pretensions at this treaty and passed the remainder of his life as a private gentleman  william now seated securely on the throne introduced everal new regulations he ordered all lawproceedings o be in the norman language deprived bishops from olding the office of judges which they had enjoyed duing all the saxons reigns restrained the clergy and labored to abolish trials by ordeal and by battle   eugen of what nature was this trial by ordeal   erast this was a remnant of pagan superstition eld in veneration by the saxons and was made use of to prove whether persons accused were innocent or guilty waterordeal was confined to the lower class of people reordeal to the upper in waterordeal the accused was thrown bound into the water if he sunk he was declared nnocent if he swam guilty in fireordeal the accused person was brought into an open plain and several ploughhares heated redhot were placed at equal distances before him over these he was to walk blindfold and if he missed them by treading between them he was acquitted of the charge as these trials were sometimes allowed to e performed by deputy we hence derive the expression of going through fire and water to serve another this mode of trial was not however abolished till the eign of henry iii   eugen what was the trial by battle   erast this was another instance of the deplorable barbarity of the times it was performed by single combat in a place appointed for the purpose between the accuser and the accused he that conquered was deemed innocent and the other if he survived was sure to suffer as a malefactor some time after this mode of trial still continues legal though out of use trial by battle as well as ordeal was set aside in williams reign and that by a jury of twelve men with which you are acquainted and which was common among the saxons was confirmed by him with all the sanction of royalty   eugen it is certainly more consistent with reason and justice   erast william having continued    years in england now thought of revisiting his native dominions being established in the dukedom of normandy on the death of his father but he was no sooner gone than a conspiracy was set on foot carried on by the normans as well as english william to gratify his followers from normandy had disposed of the estates of those who fell in the battle of hastings among them he gave each a certain quantity of land with all the inhabitants dwelling on that land so that these inhabitants were wholly at the will of their lord and they were called his bondmen for this land the lord was obliged to arm his vassals and march out in defense of the king whenever he pleased to call upon them so that each lord of a district or baron was the head of a little army this manner of holding lands is called feudal tenure and was an improvement of that state of villenage of which i have already spoken for at this time there was no standing army   eugen how long did this state of vassalage continue   erast military services for land was dropped under the reign of henry ii when money was paid in lieu of them but a remnant of this vassalage continues to this day i have explained to you the nature of manors and copyhold estates which are now held at the will of the lords of the manors in which those estates lie and for which certain acknowledgments are now made by the tenants see the index   eugen i recollect it well please to go on with the conspiracy you mentioned   erast the norman barons conceiving themselves aggrieved carried on a secret correspondence with the kings of denmark and ireland and a number of danish forces were to invade this country in the absence of william but the conspiracy was discovered before the danes arrived and two noblemen were beheaded on the ccasion  though good fortune seemed to mark his reign thus ar the decline of it was interrupted with domestic quarels he had three sons robert william and henry his eldest son robert encouraged by the king of france ade an attempt to sieze normandy and william who could place no confidence but in the english was obliged o use english forces to bring this unnatural son to his uty and it so happened by the chance of battle that in n engagement between the normans and the english william and his son fought with each other unknowingly the son attacked him with such fury that his aged father ell to the ground with the blow and had not william called out and his voice been recollected by his son his death would immediately have followed but robert tung with remorse and a consciousness of duty leaped from his horse raised his father from the ground fell prostate before him begged pardon for his offenses and promised future obedience the king moved by the impulse of nature took him once more to his arms and both armies spectators of this affecting scene participated in their joy and reconciliation  william did not live many years after this he invaded france in the year  0   with an english army and leaping a ditch the pummel of his saddle hurt him and occasioned a rupture of which he died leaving to his son robert the dukedom of normandy and the crown of england to his son william  william ii on ascending the english throne had two very powerful parties to oppose the nobility who still aspired to the same freedom they possessed under the saxon kings and the clergy who wished to erect themselves into a distinct government  odo his own uncle took upon him to dispute his title and being supported in this by his brother robert william waged war with robert and carried it on with vigor and success henry the third brother was also involved in this war having taken up arms for not being paid the money his father left him such an unnatural contest between three brothers ferved only to weaken themselves and strengthen their enemies the scots and welsh took this opportunity to make incursions upon the english the clergy complained of encroachments on their privileges the people murmured at the increase o taxes and the whole country was in arms  but now the attention of all europe was called off to one of the most remarkable events that history can produce i mean the arming for the first crusade   eugen what was that   erast peter surnamed the hermit who had beheld with indignation the cruel manner in which the infidels who had possession of christs sepulcher in the holy land treated the christians who went on pilgrimage there returned to europe resolved to inspire the princes of christendom with a zeal for it is recovery for the christians of that age thought it an essential part of their duty to go to this tomb occasionally and say their prayers to god bareheaded and barefooted therefore in the spirit of superstition he traveled from court to court preaching as he went and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people pope urban ii himself preached the necessity of this holy war and numberless persons of all degrees and nations ardently embraced the cause and put on the redcross the badge of their profession among this number was robert duke of normandy in order to supply money for this expensive undertaking he offered to mortgage his dukedom to his brother william for a stipulated sum william eagerly embraced the proposal he raised the money upon the clergy of this kingdom and when his brother was gone took peaceable possession of his dukedom  in this manner was normandy again united to the english crown and from this union afterward arose those wars with france which for whole centuries continued to depopulate both nations   eugen was not this william killed as he was hunting   erast yes in the new forest in hampshire which his father had made by laying waste a number of illages and banishing the legal possessors he was accidentally shot through the heart with an arrow by a geneman hunting with him this happened in the   th year of his age and in the year   00   eugen who succeeded him   erast there were now two competitors for the throne robert who was engaged in the holy war and henry the youngest brother who remained at home henry however took possesion of it and endeavored to secure that possession by gaining the affections of the people he therefore once more confirmed the saxon aws and indulged the clergy in all their former privileges  on roberts return from the holy land where he refused to be crowned king of jerusalem he found himself deprived of a kingdom which as elder brother to william he considered as his birthright he could not however recover it nor his dukedom of normandy but in his attempt was taken prisoner and confined twenty six years in cardiffcastle in wales where he died  to defend his possessions in normandy henry was obliged to wage war with france and during one of the engagements a french cavalier personally attacked the king and struck him twice on the head with such force that all his armor streamed with blood henry however no way intimidated continued the single combat with resolution and summoning all his strength levelled such a blow at his antagonist as threw him from his horse and the king took him prisoner this decided the victory in favor of the english and hastened a peace  henry now returning victorious from abroad brought with him a numerous retinue of the nobility in one of the vessels of the fleet his only son and several young noblemen his companions went together to render the voyage more agreeable the young prince desirous to be first ashore promised the seamen a reward if they came in foremost this emulation was fatal to them all the pilot ran the ship upon a rock and immediately she was dashed to pieces the prince however was put into a boat and would have escaped had he not been called back by the cries of matilda his sister who was married to the emperor of germany henry v and who was there in the same ship he prevailed upon the sailors to row back to take her in and the approach of save their lives several leaped in so that the boat was overloaded and all except one went to the bottom the prince was eighteen years old when henry was informed of this he covered his face and never laughed afterward   eugen was matilda drowned among the rest   erast the vessel in which she was escaped and matilda in it the emperor soon after dying she was married to geoffrey of plantagenet earl of angou by him she had a son named henry the king obliged the nobility to take an oath to support his daughter on the throne after his decease which they did by observed it no longer than whilst they were obliged to obey henry did not long survive this but died in the year       during the reign of henry the barons and the clergy were growing into power each was a petty tyrant over those who held under him in order therefore to confirm privileges so lately acquired they joined in electing a king who might owe his scepter to them they fixed on stephen nephew to the deceased king and as for their oaths to matilda or maude as she was called the bishops gave them an absolution  the kingdom now began to wear the face of aristoracy in which the barons and clergy might be said to command they built castles fortified and garrisoned them with their own troops from whence when offended they would bid their monarch defiance   eugen and did stephen submit to this   erast he could not help himself he opposed their measures took some of their castles by force but as the people were dependant on the barons the king could make but little head against them matilda now claimed the crown in pursuance of her fathers disposal of it she came over from normandy with an armed force and took possession of the castle of arundel in sussex a civil war was the consequence a victory was obtained against the king and though he fought with a party of the enemy with the utmost intrepidity performing more than could be expected from a single arm his sword flying in pieces he was obliged to surrender himself a prisoner the conqueror conducted him from the field and ignominiously said him in irons  matilda was now proclaimed queen but as she disdained to accept the shadow of royalty and the barons and clergy intending to grant no more offense was soon given matilda was obliged to quit england again stephen was released and once more placed upon the throne  stephen like matilda not caring to submit to the dictates of his subjects the barons invited over henry matildas son then twenty one years of age who had been long acknowledged as duke of normandy he soon landed with a formidable army and another civil war would have ensued had it not been agreed on by all parties that stephen should enjoy the crown for life and that henry should be his successor stephens death the year following soon put his rival in possession  henry plantagenet ascending the throne of england in    0 by hereditary succession and with the universal assent of his people and conscious of his strength began to assume those privileges which had been torn from the crown through the weakness of his predecessors   eugen what steps did he take   erast he demolished the castles dismissed all foreign troops resumed the crown lands and enacted some laws by which the people became in some measure independent of the barons he chartered several towns and laid the groundwork of english liberty having thus diminished the power of the barons by enlarging that of the people he undertook to humble the clergy he proposed that the bishops should not be permitted to go to rome that no subject should appeal to the pope that no officer of the crown should be excommunicated or suspended by the clergy and that the clergy themselves should be subject to the temporal judge these propositions were agreed to becket archbishop of canterbury however a powerful and haughty man not caring to submit was condemned as a traitor but escaped punishment by flying his country  the pope alexander iii espoused beckets quarrel and after a variety of conferences and negociations with threats and excommunications on the part of the pope which continued some years henry thought proper to acquiesce and pardon him the archbishop then made his way into london amidst the exclamations of the people he was no sooner however reinstated in his power than he excommunicated two of the nobility and suspended several of the bishops who had been his enemies complaint was made to the king then in normandy and four gentlemen at the instance of henry as is supposed undertook to curb his insolence they hastened to england entered the cathedral of canterbury where he was officiating and with a few attendants beat out his brains with clubs at the foot of the altar  his death confirmed those privileges to the clergy which his opposition could not do he was considered as a martyr to his cause and to have fallen by the hand of henry  in order to divest the attention of the public from suspicions of this nature henry undertook the conquest of ireland a project formed some years before but deferred on account of his longprotracted quarrel with becket the more readily to gain the popes consent to this for nothing then could be done without the sanction of rome he made oath that he was no way concerned in the assassination of this archbishop and made a solemn vow to go barefooted to beckets tomb and there receive the chiscipline of the church he kept his vow and sometime after was whipped by the monks accordingly  having abtained the popes consent he subdued ireland with a rapidity equal to his wishes but the happiness he received from this new accession of power was soon allayed by a conspiracy in his own family this monarch had not many vices but gallantry was one of them his queen was disagreeable and henry was faithless his amors with the fair rosamond whom he kept seetly in woodstockpark were soon discovered by his een she found her out went to her and obliged her  take poison  the matter ended not here the queens sons took part  her resentment and a conspiracy was formed abetted  all the malcontents in the kingdom henry opposed ith his usual prudence and resolution and seemed every here victorious but ascribing the opposition of his own children to the anger of heaven he was resolved by an emplary penance to conciliate it is favor this pence was going as i said to beckets tomb and submitting  be scourged by the monks it did not however reconle him to his family so that he pined with grief and nding his end approach caused himself to be carried into e church at chinon in normandy and expired before e altar with scarce a single attendant to deplore his fall   eugen we are indebted however to this king for e of our dominions   erast nay he not only conquered ireland but raised  00000 l among king of scotland he took him prisoner and made him give up the independency of his crown  henry ii was succeeded by his second son richard i       a romantic desire for strange adventures and  immoderate zeal for the externals of christianity were e ruling passions of the times and they readily became ose of richard impressed with a desire of rescuing the ply land from the infidels he left england and with a umerous army passed through france took in his way e island of cyprus from a christian prince landed in alestine conquered saladine with the slaughter of 0000 saracens took several cities from the infidels d gained great reputation for conduct and personal bravery having concluded a truce with saladin for three ears he set sail for his return but tempestuous weather liged him to land on the coast of italy where pursuing s way homeward by land he was taken prisoner near vienna by the duke of austria and put into the hands of the emperor who ungenerously detained him on the ost frivolous pretense  england had been left in his absence under the government of two bishops who disagreed between themselves and thus weakened the power of the clergy john the brother of richard took now advantage of his confinement formented this jealousy among the clergy and putting himself at the head of the barons increased their authority by the addition of his own but the clergy faithful to their king raised  00000 l among themselves with this ransom procured his enlargement and he returned his brother john sued to him for pardon and was generously forgiven  richard was some time after engared in a french war and whilst he was abroad an insurrection took place in london owing to a new tax which the people disliked one william fitzosborne a lawyer commonly called longbeard was their ringleader but the principal citizens being called to arms longbeard was taken convicted and with nine of his accomplices hanged in chains this was the first instance of the peoples rising in defense of their liberties independent of the barons or the clergy   eugen how long did richard reign   erast at the siege of chaluz near limoges richard received a wound on the shoulder with an arrow of which he died after a turbulent reign of ten years  the wars now kindled up between england and france continued to depopulate both countries and john the brother and successor of richard pursued them with unabating vigor  john mounted the throne in exclusion to his nephew arthur duke of bretagne and not contented with this he wrested his dukedom from him also took the unfortunate arthur prisoner confined him and he was never heard of afterward john was suspected of putting him to death and this crime opened the way to his future ruin he was cited to paris to answer for it but not attending his dominions in france were taken from him and john tamely submitted to it  having thus given offense abroad he soon did the same at home he interfered in the election of an archbishop of canterbury opposing the popes nomination ich former kings had not done and thus drew upon n the resentment of the clergy the pope excommucated him forbad his subjects longer to obey him and ve the kingdom of the england to the king or france ilip the french king accepted the gift and prepared to ke possession of it whilst on the other hand john d raised army of  0000 men and marched to dor to oppose him the pope however stepped in beeen them and by his legate or ambassador in a conferce with john at dover advised him to put himself unr his protection as the only means to save himself and ngdom from the king of france john swore to perform at the pope should propose and this was to resign his ngdom into the popes hands which he accordingly did public in the most solemn manner   eugen and was the church by this means absolutely st to him   erast no he held it still but as a tributary prince  the sea of rome that is to say he agreed to pay a cerin sum annually for the kingdoms of england and irend and to act in all things as the pope should direct him e by this means saved himself from an invasion of the ng of france  thus did this king render himself contemptible in the es of all the world he had now only to offend the rons to render himself perfectly obnoxious and this he d not fail to do they demanded the reestablishment  their ancient privileges and john believed himself auorised to resuse them yet demanded their assistance  recover his lost dominions in france they refusing is in their turn hostilities began a confederacy was rmed and he found himself compelled to sign that charr called magna charta by which the english are said  hold their liberties to this day  this charter was in fact giving the barons leave to present to the king what they thought grievances and d he was in forty days to give them satisfaction or ey were legally empowered to command it this was  infringement of the royal prerogative which he comied with through fear but as soon as he was at liberty retracted from and complained to the pope of the usurpation of the barons upon this the pope excommunicated them   even you have frequently mentioned excommunication what is this   erast a power the pope formerly claimed of depriving a person of the benefit of the laws of his country excluding him from the bosom of the church the ecclesiatical court retains the same power now and denounces it on particular offenders when the king was excommunicated the pope absolved his subjects from their allegiance forbad them to obey and gave away his kingdom to another  what the pope had formerly done the barons thought proper to do now they offered the crown of england to france and philip accepted it with joy but fearing the popes displeasure he prevailed on the english barons to elect his son louis in this they agreed and the city of london lent it is assistance louis landed in england with a large army in      john was deposed and louis was crowned at london which so affected johns spirits that it occasioned his death the same year in the fifty first year of his age after having reigned seventeen years   eugen did louis continue king   erast no had louis dissembled till firmly seated on the throne he might have retained the crown but the barons wanted a monarch subservient to their power and louis refused a kingdom upon such conditions he of course after a defeat left england and henry iii the son of john then only ten years old was crowned in his stead and the earl of pembroke appointed his guardian  things went on pretty well during the regency of the early of pembroke as he kept up his interest with the clergy and thus preserved a balanced in the state but no sooner was henry of age and took the reins of government into his own hands than numberless insurrections and calamities were the result of his obstinacy his folly and his vice infinite were the struggles of power between the barons and the king henrys luxury and profuseness continually rendered him a petitioner to the assembly of e barons for money for since the abolition of military rvices kings asked money instead of soldiers and they  constantly demanded a confirmation of their former prileges  he found various methods however of raising money  exaction but not sufficient to supply his wants and e barons finding nothing could be done with him for e space of forty years at last shook off their allegiance and sent the king notice that they renounced the fealty ey owed him and considered him only as the common emy of mankind  both parties were now in arms the country became gain the treatre of a civil war and nothing was thought f but the decision of the sword a battle ensued and the ing and his son edward were taken prisoners  the barons and the clergy now called in the sanction f the people in order to new model the constitution and from this time we may truly date the origin of engish liberty a parliament was summoned in which the ing was obliged to give orders that four knights from ach country should sit in order to represent their respecive shires this is the first rude outline of an english ouse of commons the people had been gaining some consequence since the diminution of the feudal laws and he establishment of corporations by which men were not o dependent on the men of land and property as arts ncreased the number of corporations increased and they ere now so numerous as to be consulted in the legislation had the barons and people at this time been unaimous they might have governed the nation without a monarch but they disagreed another battle ensued the kings party was victorious and henry and his son were restored this was in      he lived about seventeen years after this died at the age of sixty five and was succeeded by his son edward i   discourse iii the same subject continued erast at the death of his father edward i was engaged in the holy war where he was wounded and as it is said with a poisoned arrow and that his queen eleanor who was present healed the wound by sucking out the poison with her mouth  on his return to england he took possession of an undisputed throne and being satisfied with moderate power labored only to be terrible to his enemies he marched against the welsh and defeated them killed their king and annexed it is principality to the crown of england giving the title of prince of wales to his eldest son  his next attention was bestowed on scotland where there were two competitors for the throne bruce and baliol edward was umpire between them that is determined the difference and fixed the crown on the head of baliol less as a king than as a vassal of england but this bringing on a civil was in that country edward marched there with a numerous army and had nearly conquered it intending to unite it with england but death interrupted his career in the   th year of his age and   th of his reign  it is to edward i however that we owe the great power of the people finding the clergy and barons were rivals he studied to weaken their force for this purpose he threw weight into the scale of the commons and law was enacted that no tax should be levied without their consent his design was to render himself absolute by their assistance but he died and left the people a share of authority which was given them for very different purposed than the promotion of liberty  he was succeeded in   0  by his fourth son edward ii by his maladministraction and countenancing some favorites in opposition to the barons he brought on a civil war battles were fought many noble prisoners taken on both sides and the scaffolds were drenched with english blood the leaders of the different parties when en being instantly put to death edwards queen was oud haughty and revengeful woman sister to the g of france and being faithless to her husband inguing with mortimer earl of march the king envoured to secure him and on her being sent over to nce on a negotiation her paramour went with her persuaded her brother to espouse her cause and rened with an army of which mortimer was at the head ve the king battle took him prisoner deposed him  her son a youth of fourteen on the throne hanged her bands favorites and took upon her the regency dug her sons minority nothing now but the death of ward was wanting to complete her guilt he was sent m prison to prison the sport of his mercenary keepers d suffered all the indignities that cruel and ingenious lainy could devise and was at last very cruelly murred in berkeleycastle by ruffians supposed to be emyed by her and mortimer this was in        eugen and did the nation submit to this   erast they did and it is a proof in my opinion their pusillanimity for edwards greatest fault was the olence of his friendships edward iii however his  when of age punished his mother and her friend ortimer for the murder of his father mortimer was agged from the queens presence in spite of her entreaes to the contrary and was hanged and the queen was nfined for the rest of her life which was a space of    ears  under edward iii our parliament the bulwark of r constitution was reduced to a better form a spirit  liberty breathes in all his laws but no one knew how  make himself more absolute he began his reign by ducing the scots to the most distressful situation and ce more obliged them to acknowledge their dependence n the crown of england but his attention was soon rawn off to objects of greater moment on the death f charles king of france who left a young wife with hild there being no apparent heir the next heir to the rown was to be regent and this office edward iii as the grandson of a king of france by his mothers fi claimed in preference to philip valois the next he by the male line philips claims were admitted and the widowed queen being brought to bed of a daughter philip was elected king edward therefore disputed the crown and invaded france with a powerful army  on edwards landing philip challengedhim to fing combat and edward accepted it but some obstacles intervening the war was prosecuted in the usual manner many skirmishes took place which at last drew on the decisive battle of cressy that every honest englishman boas of to this hour philip was at the head of  00000 me and edward only of  0000 the first line of whose ar was commanded by edwards son called the black prince from his black hair a youth of fifteen years of age the valor of this lad filled even veterans with astonishment and to him the success of the day was committed in short the english were victorious  0000 french were slain and not  00 english edward in his way home took the town of calais of which the english kept possession   0 years  whilst the english were thus employed abroad the king of scots took the opportunity and invaded england the queen in the absence of her husband marched at the head of a large army northwards gave the scots batth and took their king prisoner  philips of france soon after dying was succeeded by john and the war continuing edward the black prince at the head of and english army defeated the french again at the battle of poictiers and took their king prisoner thus did edward see two crowned heads his captives i london   eugen he would have made a fine heroic king   erast he never lived to be king for the died five years before his father which happened in      in the   th year of his age after having reigned  0 years h successor was his grandson richard a minor eleven year old the son of prince edward and the regent was  uncle john of ghent duke of lancaster   eugen what became of the two captive kings   erast they were both ransomed that is released he promise of their respective countries paying england m of money but france not making good her payts john returned to london and died in the savoy t this time in order to assist portugal it was necessary aise a large sum of money and this parliament thought per to do by a poletax that is each family paying much a head according to the number it consisted  this was so unpalatable to the people that an insurtion was the consequence headed by one wat tyler wbred man and a desperate one it began in essex  soon spread to london the people burned and piled where ever they came and when they reached lonn took up their quarters about the city richard n but fifteen years old riding to smithfield invited em to a conference there tyler with his party gave n the meeting on horseback and made several proposals nded in justice but tyler during his conversation liftg up his sword in a menacing manner so exasperated alworth then mayor of london who attended the ng that the struck tyler down with his mace and phil one of the aldermen riding up run his sword through  body  tylers party now bent their bows in order to venge the death of their leader but richard instead of ing rode up to the rebels crying out with a resolute ice what my lieges will you kill your king be not concerned for the loss of your leader i myself will be now your general follow me into the field and you shall have whatever you desire  the rebels immediately desisted and the next day reived a charter of freedom and a general pardon but ese only were extorted grants and soon retracted and e ringleaders were tried and put to death  from this noble act of walworths the sword has been art of the city arms ever since   eugen did no bad consequence follow richards reach of his word   erast yes it made the lower class of people his nemies and at the age of seventeen he offended the parliament through a scheme he had laid of rendering himsels absolute the barons were presently at the he of  0000 men and the king was obliged to submit  making a fresh attempt three years after it did not  so well having found means to bring over the pament to his measures many of the opposers lost their li on the occasion and some were banished the peop however were far from satisfied and richard having abitrarily banished his cousin the duke of lancasters  and the duke of norfolk for quarrelling the forme on the death of his father took the opportunity in     whilst richard was over in ireland to quell an insurrection there and landed in england when on shore he cal the people to his assistance they presently raised an ar of  0000 men and became so powerful that richard  his return could make no head against them he w obliged therefore to throw himself on the generosity of his enemy richard was dethroned and the duke lancafter took the crown as henry iv   eugen what became of richard   erast he was sent a prisoner to the tower where was soon after murdered by ruffians employed for the purpose but not till after he had slain four of his assassin   eugen what was henrys claim to the crown   erast he was the grandson of edward iii by  fourth son john duke of lancaster whereas richard was grandson of edward iii by his eldest son edward t black prince but as there was a descendant of the du of york an older brother than henrys father his chi claim was the resignation of richard in his favor  from this seizure of the crown by henry iv begand the contests between the houses of york and lancaster whi for several years afterward deluged the kingdom wit blood but which in the end contributed to give streng and consistency to the constitution  henry during his reign had to contend with the sco and the welsh and various rebellions in favor of the hou of york were stirred up against him the former he ha the good fortune to defeat and the latter to suppre the murmurs of the clergy however were of greate moment wicklifle who first preached the protesta doctrine in germany had published his opinions about he end of edward the thirds reign and the clergy of england were apprehensive of its prevailing here henry arnestly therefore recommended it to his parliament to prevent it and an act was passed that condemned heretics o the flames in consequence of this act the rector of a church in england a follower of wicklifle was condemnd to the stake and burnt alive the first man in england ho suffered death in the cause of religion  on the death of henry iv in      his son henry v who in his juvenile days had led a profligate life associting with men of very abandoned characters ascended he throne at this barbarous period learning was little aught after even bishops could scarcely read or write their names courage seemed to be regarded as the only virtue and that with superstition stamped the character of heroism   eugen did henry the fifths reign proceed undisturbed   erast henry began his reign in attempting to extirpate the heresy of wicklifle and sir john oldcastle aron of cobham the chief protector of this sect was condemned to the flames such steps must naturally create not only horror but disgust in the people at the severities of such a government great at this time were the domestic troubles in france and henry thought it no ad opportunity to insist on a restitution of normandy and those provinces that had been taken from england in preceding reigns he for this purpose invaded france with  0000 men but an epidemic disorder carried off three fourths of his soldiers reduced now to  000 men he was opposed by a french army of   0000 this disparity of number however did not discourage henry the two armies met at agincourt and the english being resolved either to conquer or die fell upon the enemy with such impetuosity that they soon routed them henry alighted from his horse and fought at the head of his men on foot eighteen french cavaliers resolving either to kill him or fall in the attempt rushed on him at once and one of them stunned him with the blow of a battleax when two or three welchmen came to his assistance a the eighteen frenchmen were slain tois intrepidity  their king inspired the english troops with new courag and the french were defeated henry made a triumph entry into paris and receiving the fealty or homage of the french nobility returned to england to raise fresh forced in order to subdue the country entirely depose their king who was a lunatic and fix the crown on his own head he went over to france again for that purpose but dea stopped him in his carreer at the age of thirtyfour  henry vi and son of henry v succeeded to the throne at the age of nine months the duke of bedford his uncle being appointed regent it was determined  prosecute the french war and charles vi it is lunat king being dead and his son charles vii his next hei disinherited for the murder of the duke of burgundy it was resolved to set henry on the throne of that kingdom he was accordingly proclaimed king of france and the duke of bedford declared regent of that kingdom whilst his brother the duke of gloucester another of the kings uncles had the government of england charle vii the nominal king of france whenever he attempte to face his enemy was overthrown and nothing could have helped him but almost a miracle  to bring about by art what force could not atchieve  french gentleman fixed upon the servant maid of an inn a woman of masculine strength and courage pretendin to be but eighteen when in reality she was twent seven years of age and instructed her in the duties of  warrior and prophetess this was joan of arc the renowned maid of orleans she equipped herself in the habit and arms of a man and gave out that she was inspied she was examined by the university and they either deceived or willing to be so affirmed that that be commission came from heaven  the english were at that time besieging the city  orleans charles viiths last resource and were upon the point of becoming masters of it when joan undertoo to relieve it she addressed the soldiers as a messeng from heaven assured them providence would fight f them headed the army routed the english wherever  opposed prophesied that charles vii should reco his crown and as she foretold it came to pass and assisted at his coronation this chain of successes enly turned the scale in favor of the french and the glish lost the kingdom wholly   eugen was joan of arc rewarded equal to her des   erast in the midst of the french kings good fore she was taken prisoner by the english prosecuted them for sorcery and condemned and publicly burnt  witch  the loss of france was a distressing calamity to the glish and at this period the duke of york asserted his im to the english crown he was a nobleman descend by the mothers side from lionel one of the sons of ward iii but older than john duke of lancaster m whom henry iii was descended of course had a or claim the ensign or banner of the duke was a ite rose that of henry a red one this gave names the two houses whose contentions were about to drench  kingdom with slaughter  the queen who was a princess of sicily and an enterzing woman had the management of affairs and goned every thing with an unlimited authority the  of suffolk was her favorite and an avowed enemy the house of york but being impeached in parliament  banished and on his passage to france was beheaded board the vessel by a common sailor the death of  man set the duke of york more at his ease  among the insurrectioins of these times was that in  led on by jack cade a man of low condition at head of  0000 kentish men who marched to london  sent to court a list of grievances but which was supsed by his being taken and put to death though  rebel met such a fate his chief object was to favor cause of the duke of york who aspired to the crown  quiet however this powerful man the duke of soset protector was sent to the tower and the duke of k appointed in his stead but the king then twenty three years of age not choosing to be any longer under control deposed the duke from his power and had re course to arms being taken however prisoner at the battle of st albans the duke of york was again reinstated in his protectorate henry was soon after released but being ill the queen took arms in his defense aled his forces on to oppose the dukes army headed by the earl of warwick him she gave battle to the king looking on a tame spectator and had the misfortune to b worsted and her husband taken prisoner a second time  the duke how openly clained the crown the matt was debated in parliament and it was determined th henry should possess the throne for life and should b succeeded by the duke in exclusion of the prince of wale henrys son  all except the queen agreed to this but she a woman of spirit and pride flew to wales animated her o friends acquired new ones and raised an army to defe her cause she and her old enemy the duke of york met at wakefield victory was on her side and the du and his second son were slain the queen now marche to london in order to set the king at liberty gave batt to the earl of warwick defeated him and released him but the city of london exasperated at his conduct of the queens elected the duke of yorks son king by  name of edward iv the queen on this collected great army in the north to the number of  0000  the earl of warwick accompanied by young king eward opposed her with  0000 men never was england depopulated by so dreadful a day warwi gained a complete victory but  0000 men fell a sacrif in the contest edward iv was established on the thro and the queen fled with her husband to scotland for ptection  wretched as this reign was yet the art of print was introduced in it through which the age grew m and more enlightened learning at this period was  known among the common class of men but by no me neglected by the clergy   eugen did the queen set down quietly under this efeat   erast no nothing was able to abate her perseerance she entered england again with her husband and five thousand men granted her by the french king ave her enemy battle and was again defeated when enry was taken prisoner and conducted to the tower the queen however escaped and retired to her father in icily  the earl of warwick who had seated edward on the rone proposed his marrying a foreign princess and dward refusing it so enraged the earl that he became is enemy and determined to set his brother clarence on e throne who had married the earls daughter to ring about this purpose he invited edward to his house d there treacherously made him a prisoner but escaping on afterward the citizens of london declared in his vour and he was presently at the head of a numerous my  warwick fled to france was reconciled to henrys een and in conjunction with her returned with a numer of french forces opposed edward with  0000 men feated him and edward in his turn was obliged to fly  holland warwick advanced to london set henry ce more at liberty and placed him on the throne ence warwick was called a kingmaker a parliament as summoned and henrys rights confirmed   eugen what became of edward   erast edward though an exile in holland had any partisans at home after therefore an absence of e months he returned to england under a pretense of iming the dukedom of york when here he usurped ngly authority made henry a prisoner again and soon sing an army in his interest gave warwick battle at rnet and there defeated and killed him  the queen still made head against him accompanied th her son the prince of wales but she was again deted by edward and the prince was taken prisoner t he did not long survive for the spirited boy being ought before his victor and asserting his right the barrous monarch struck him with his gauntlet and instantly the kings brothers viz the dukes of gloucester and clarence rushed on him with their daggers and destroyed him to complete the tragedy gloucester afterward richard iii entered king henrys chamber alone and mundered him in cold blood   eugen what became of the queen   erast she also was taken prisoner but louis xi king of france paid the king of england  0000 crowns for her freedom and she died a few years after in privacy in france  edward being now settled on the throne wreaked his vengeance on all the lancastrian party putting all to death wherever he could find them but the great object of his vengeance was henry earl of richmond afterward henry vii   eugen who was this nobleman   erast he was the great grandson of the earl of somerset who was the eldest son of john duke of lancaster by his last wife whereas henry iv the grandfather of henry vi was the duke of lancasters son by a former wife   eugen but who was the earl of richmonds father   erast one edmund tudor a welsh gentleman who married a granddaughter of the earl of somerset i have mentioned of course he was fifth cousin to edward iv he lived in france to secure himself from edwards cruelty  edward had two brother the dukes of gloucester and clarence clarence had assisted him in obtaining the crown but being treated afterward with indifference and reproaching his brother for it the king unmindful of the ties of kindred or of gratitude had him arraigned condemned and put to death he was drowned in a butt of malmsey wine a death of clarences own choosing  the rest of edwards life was spent in riot and debauchery he was going to war with france but died before it took place edward was handsome and brave but mentally deformed with every vice   eugen his reign was surely a horrid one   erast horrid as it was you must prepare for events in the next still more so  edward left two sons the eldest of whom a boy between twelve and thirteen was proclaimed king in      and his mother who lately raised among the nobility wished to hide her want of rank among a new promotion was for having a number of peers created this gave offense to the old nobility and richard duke of gloucester the kings uncle who was of a tyrannical disposition fomented their discontents having shown the danger of etting the queen have the government in her hands he procured himself to be chosen protector of the realm and thus got possession of the young king and his brother the duke of york a child about seven years of age whom under a pretense of providing for their safety he sent prisoners to the tower   eugen how was the queen reconciled to this   erast she could not prevent it she had with the princes taken sanctuary in westminsterabbey but on he duke of glocesters promising to be a father to her children she was induced to part with them though with eluctance  gloucester had no sooner secured their persons but he asterdized them by act of parliament and by pretended bstacles put off the young kings coronation lord hastings lord stanley and some other of the nobility oresaw the protectors design upon the crown and formd plans to prevent it but gloucester being aware of it alled a council at the tower and when hastings and tanley were there charged hastings with high treason and had him immediately beheaded a blow was levelled t stanleys life but he escaped under a table some others fell a sacrifice at this time to the protectors resentent the duke of buckingham who was in richards nterest stirred up the people in his favor and prevaild on the city of london to offer him the crown which e seemed at first unwilling to accept but was at length revailed on from an idea that his brothers children ere bastards and of course not entitled to inherit and that was the young king to be crowned the kingdom would not be safe in his hands  richard was accordingly crowned and his next ste was to make away with his two nephews then in the tower to effect this he gave secret orders as it i said to one tyrell to put them to death which wa done by smothering them between two pillows and bur their bodies under the staircase   eugen did this tyrell escape unpunished for hi crime   erast no vengeance though late followed hi and he was executed for it in the succeeding reign when he confessed the whole  thus did richard wade through every obstacle to the throne but he did not enjoy it long his friend the duke of buckingham not having been rewarded according to his expectations conspired against him and declare for henry duke of richmond whom i have alread mentioned   eugen in what situation was this gentleman   erast he was at this time an exile in bretagn and had the good fortune to survive the numerous masscres of the preceding reigns he was once delivered up  the ambassadors of edward iv and was just on the poin of being brought back to england where he would certainly have been put to death but the duke of bretag repented of the act and took him from the ambassador just as he was brought on shipboard henry was the only remaining branch of the house of lancaster and  was the person whom the duke of buckingham pitch upon to dethrone the tyrant richard   eugen how old was henry   erast quite a young man not more than twent seven he promised in case he succeeded to the thron to marry the daughter of edward iv the only survivi heir of that family and richard having rendered hi self exceedingly unpopular the people were in gene against him henry was therefore encouraged to inva england which he did at the head of about  000 foreign ops and was joined when here by about  000 english d welsh   eugen did not the duke of buckingham join him   erast he headed a party of welsh henrys faour but being deserted by his followers was obliged to crete himself in the house of one who had originally been s servant and to whom he had been very kind yet this rvaat gave him up for a reward and he was beheaded en without a trial   eugen did not this discourage henry   erast not at all it was rather a spur to his enrprize he gave richard then at the head of   000 en battle at bosworthfield where he had the good ortune to slay him but not before richard had displayed me very astonishing acts of personal valor  richards crown being found by one of the soldiers was mmediately placed on the head of the conqueror by at very lord stanley whom richard had endeavored  destroy at the council in the tower thus in the death of richard ended the race of the plantagenet kings which ad been in possession of the crown for three hundred and thirty years and in him also ended the contest between the houses of york and lancaster which had for thirty ears been a scourge to the kingdom and in which above  hundred thousand men lost their lives either by battle r the scaffold   eugen had richard no family   erast none he married the widow of the young rince of wales henry viths son whom he had murered but she felt the consequences of her ingratitude to er former husband in the inhumanity of richard for he reated her so ill that she broke her heart as he wished is view being to marry his niece the daughter of edward iv but she detested the proposal and would not think of it  from the accession of henry vii to the throne of this country the whole government seems to have put on a ew form if he was not the greatest prince he was by far the most useful one that ever reigned a nation of tumult was reduced through him to a civil subordination an insolent and factious aristocracy was humbled wise laws were enacted commerce restored and peace and happiness introduced to a people little better than in a state of barbarism for thirteen hundred years before  henrys first care was to marry the princess elizabeth daughter of edward iv thus uniting the interests of the houses of lancaster and york he has been accused of avarice but perhaps unjustly so before his reign it was usual for high treason to take away the life of the aggressor and give away his fortune to some court favorite this henry perceived had two bad effects it excited resentment by it is cruelty and made a favorite too powerful for subjection to avoid this he deprived such as were taken in arms of their property and reserved it for the use of the crown he was a great economist which enabled him not only to be useful to the poor but just to his own creditors  immediately after his marriage he issued out a general pardon to all who would accept of it but those who flew to arms were quelled and some of the ringleaders executed  sagacious however as henry was he was jealous of his power and though the earl of warwick a son of the duke of clarence edward the ivths brother was only a boy and nothing alleged against him still as he was related to the house of york he shut him up a close prisoner in the tower this youth was however made an instrument to deceive the people a priest of oxford had trained up one lambert simnel a bakers son to counterfeit the person of this earl and having prepared him for his purpose he sat out for ireland and there opened the scene the plot unfolded to his wish simnel was received and proclaimed king and was conducted by the people and officers of state with great pomp to the castle   eugen what could have induced this priest to play off this trick   erast it was a scheme of the queen dowagers to dispossess henry of the crown for which she was confined in a monastery where she remained many year till she died to get rid however of this imposture henry rdered the earl of warwick who was still a prisoner in the tower to be led publicly through the streets of london to convince the people of the deception but this did not answer the purpose simnel being joined by some of the discontented party came over to england and marched to york the people here did not join him and the king giving him battle simnels party was deeated and he himself taken prisoner henry had too uch greatness of mind to put him to death but appointed him to a mean office in his service in which post e died as for the priest his instructor he was made a prisoner for life  all things being thus adjusted henry laid a design of recovering his french dominions by an attack upon france and the parliament furnished him with supplies for that purpose but when the money came to be collected it occasioned a new insurrection and the earl of northumberland in attempting to enforce obedience to he laws was killed by the mob in yorkshire the mutineers did not stop here but by the advice of one johnchambre marched toward london to give the king battle and the consequence was a defeat and the death of their ringleader who was executed upon the occasion  scarce was this matter ended but the old duchess of burgundy sister to edward iv set on foot another impostor she first spread a report that the duke of york edward ivths second son was not murdered in the tower as was said but was still alive and then pitched upon a genteel young man the son of a flemish jew to personate him at the desire of the duchess the king of france received him but afterward at henrys request discountenanced him  henry took some pains to show the people the fallacy of this by proving that the duke of york was dead and punishing his murderers and by tracing the impostor whose name was perkin warbeck to his original obscurity but so determined was the kings enemies to dispossess him of the crown that nothing could interrupt their design warbeck landed in kent but was soon driven off again by the inhabitants he went from thence to ireland and next to scotland where james iv ki of that country received him acknowledged his pretesions and gave him in marriage one of his kinswomen a daughter of the earl of huntley and by marching a army into england made another attempt to set him o the throne james however not finding the country  in his cause retired into scotland and obliged perkin  seek for a new protector   eugen he must have played his part very well obtain such countenance   erast if he was not the duke of york he certain was very well instructed but there are historians w say that he and his brother edward v were clandestine sent abroad that edward v died but that his brother survived and was the same who was afterward known  the name of perkin warbeck however be this as  will he had been acknowledged in france flanders irland and scotland as lawful heir to the british crow and had made some bold attempt to second his pretensions there was at this time also an insurrection cornwall under one flammoc a lawyer in opposition to some taxes that were levying by act of parliament and as every insurrection now was followed with a project dethroning the king the insurgents marched to london and encamped at black heath where the kings for surrounded and defeated them some of the ringleader were executed and the rest were permitted to retu home these men on their return sent for perkin warbeck then in ireland to head them he accepted the invitation landed in the west took the title of richa iv and with a body of  000 men attempted to sto the city of exeter but without success the ki marched against him perkins losing all his courag fled and took sanctuary in the monastery of bewdle soon after on the promise of a pardon he surrende himself and was sent prisoner to the tower where concert with the earl of warwick plotting against henry and being convicted of a degsin to escape by killing t keeper of the tower they were in the year      both p to death  this same year henrys eldest son arthur was married o the princess catharine of arrragon the daughter of the ing of spain and he dying soon after such was henrys unwillingness to pay back her marriageportion as by agreement that he consented to her being married again o his second son afterward henry viii on pretense that the first match had not been consummated  his eldest daughter margaret was soon after married o james iv of scotland through whom the kings of scotland became possessed of the throne of england and rough whom our present king george iiids descent is raced from henry vii   eugen i wish you would explain this to me   erast for the present let it suffice to say that on the death of queen elizabeth the granddaughter of henry vii her cousin james vi of scotland the greatgrandon of james iv and margaret daughter of henry vii became king of england i will show you from whom ur present king is descended when i come to speak of the reign of this james vi who was james i of england   eugen why did you so extol the character of henry   erast because he was fond of peace and seemed to ave the interest of his people at heart he had no amition to extend his power except by treaties and by wisdom and his great plan was to equalize the people by epressing the nobility and clergy and giving the popuace more weight in the scale of government but his greatest efforts were to promote trade and commerce he ied at the age of fiftytwo having reigned twentythree years  in henry viii his son and successor all factions were xtinguished and all divisions united by the fathers de he claimed the crown from the house of lancaster by the mothers from the house of york and his father eft him a kingdom in peace prudent ministers and a full treasury   eugen i presume then his reign was a happy one   erast far from it the advantages he had he wed not to himself but either to nature fortune or his ather though well educated henry wanted wisdom and virtue so that he did not turn the blessings he enjoyed to advantage if ever there was a tyrant he was one   eugen what acts of tyranny was he guilty of   erast the first act of injustice which marked hi reign was the prosecution and execution of empson an dudley two judges whom his father had appointed t enquire into cases of treason and levy fines in proportion to the offense their conduct was examined and a nothing capital could be brought against them they suffered death upon a false accusation  he next aimed at the crown of france but at the loss of a very considerable treasure he was the dupe of the emperor maximilian the poorest prince in europe and gave himself up to the guidance of cardinal wolsey   eugen who was this wolsey   erast he was the son of a private gentleman was brought up to the church and rose by degrees to be employed as an ambassador to henry vii when henry viii came to the crown he was dean of lincoln but becoming a favorite with the king and admistering to him in all his pleasures and amors he w made a privy counselor lord chancellor archbishop  york bishop of durham prime minister and through henrys interest a cardinal and legate to the pope in short he was grown so powerful that the nobility were jealous and the duke of buckingham son of him wh lost his life in the reign of richard iii laboring to oppo him was charged by wolsey with high treason and th fell a sacrifice to his resentment   eugen but this man i understand fell at last himself   erast he did and i will show you by and by b what means but prior to this i must inform you that a in the last reign the miseries of the people chiefly aros from the licentiousness of the nobility in this they proceeded from the usurpations of the king yet during th whole reign there was no rebellion not from the people love for their sovereign but from fear of nonsucces henry viiths prudence having made such measure doubtful   eugen had not this king many wives   erast no less than six his first wife was his brothers widow whom he afterward divorced and two of his eens he put to death on charges of adultery   eugen who were these two   erast anne bulleyn and catharine howard  enry was lost as it were in the embraces of his mistresses ever attended to the complaints of his people and woly who had the sole administration of affairs pursued very measure to keep him ignorant in order to increase s own authority but an event took place in this reign at put an end to wolseys exorbitant power   eugen what was this   erast that which is know in history by the name  the reformation   eugen shall i trouble you to explain it to me   erast till the reign of henry viiith the roman tholic doctrine was the religion of this country and probly would have continued longer so had not henry und the popes power inconvenient to him for though e protestant faith had been preached by luther in ermany and seemed to gain ground in that country t henry took up the pen in opposition to it and dended the errors of the church of rome to the utmost  his abilities for which work the pope honored him th the title of defender of the faith an appellation connued by our kings to the present day but no sooner d henry find the pope averse to his divorcing his first fe who was the widow of his brother not being able  bring anne bulleyn to his wishes without marrying her an he thought proper to question the popes power and olsey taking part with the pontiff drew on him henrys imosity this led the way to the reformation he dermined to throw off the popes yoke and the parliaent cooperating with him a change of faith took place and the religion of this country was altered this event as in        eugen why was the reformed religion called the rotestant   erast because at the diet or assembly of the german tes at spires in    0 several protested against a decree of the diet to support the doctrines of the church  rome   eugen i presume it was this opposition of wolse to the kings will that occasioned his downfall   erast it was henry degraded him from his office confined him to his country house and deprived him  the greatest part of his property   eugen could henry do this of his own accord   erast it was done indeed under the sanction of la he was charged with introducing bulls from rome with out the kings consent was tried found guilty and the parliament confirming the sentence of the courts he wa sent an exile to his country seat soon after he was  rested by the kings orders and died in his way to london not without the suspicion of his having poison himself   eugen what are those bulls you mentioned   erast decrees of the court of rome so calle from bulla the seal hanging to them   eugen what was henrys general character   erast that of a cruel tyrant some sovereig have been tyrants from contradiction and revolt so from being misled by favorites and some from a spirt party but henry was cruel from disposition alone cr in his government cruel in religion putting many  death on account of it and cruel in his family yet trant as he was he died peaceably a natural death whi henry vi the most harmless of all monarchs was de throned imprisoned an assassinated it is folly to sa that good or bad actions are their own recompenses he the wicked have their good things in this life the vituous must look for them in another   eugen was the protestant religion perfectly delled during the reign of this prince   erast no the alterations in henrys reign w rather separations from the pope than a reformation  religious abuses in the reign of his son edward vi  errors of rome became truly reformed this prince  but nine years old when he came to the crown and the in      his uncle the duke of somerset was ma protector and the whole administration devolved on him d his council he was an amiable man and all the tions of his life were directed by motives of religion d honor this nobleman in conjunction with craner archbishop of canterbury undertook to make a al reformation in religion when henry viii only prended to do it   eugen did the roman catholics in general submit this reform   erast far from it there were insurrections in rious parts of england but the protector who was a iend to the populace did every thing to redress their omplaints and thus stopped their fury for a while he was however obliged at last to have recourse to violence and the commotions were quelled the nobility however ok part against him accused the duke of high treason e was convicted condemned and lost his head in    0   eugen how did the young king act in this affair   erast he was too young to enter into it of course as passive he did not however long survive it for e died in        eugen who succeeded him   erast it was a custom with monarchs in this age  leave the crown by will henry viii in conformity  this practice bequeathed the throne first to edward s son by his third wife next to mary his daughter by s first wife and after her in case they had no issue to lizabeth his daughter by his second wife these daughrs having been deemed illegitimate by parliament gave casion to other persons claiming the crown as i will y and by show you   eugen did edward vi make a will   erast yes and left the crown to lady jane gray  girl of sixteen daughter of his aunt she being next in ccession admitting that his sisters mary and elizabeth ere set aside for illegitimacy she accordingly claimed e crown and had a party to support her but the people in general being in favor of mary lady jane greys rty was overpowered and she and her husband were eheaded   eugen was the nation much indebted to mary   erast mary now settled on the throne proceeded like a female fury to reesablish popery throughout the kingdom and again involved the nation in bloodshed   eugen was not mary a great bigot   erast very much so and her hushand the king  spain was not less remarkable for his attachment to popery during her reign many protestant bishops among whom was cranmer and others were burnt because they would not deny their faith   eugen did mary proceed in this spirit of perfection from motives of virtue   erast it is allowed she did her father henry viii was a tyrant from vicious principles but the enemies of mary admit she was one from virtuous principles she had imprisoned her sister elizabeth from a fear the she would take part against her elizabeth being in he heart a protestant and nothing but marys death in      prevented that of her sisters   eugen did she mean then to take away her life   erast it was not absolutely so declared but it wa universally thought that mary waited only for some favorable pretext to do it  elizabeth now ascended the throne amid the acclimations of the people during her confinement she cultivate her mind and learned the different languages and sciences and commenced her reign with the reestablishment  protestantism and it is to the measures she pursued and the plans she fell upon that this country owe the blessing of the present established church but whilst she was the securing peace at home the neighboring nations france scotland spain and the pope were all combined against her   eugen was not her title to the crown disputed   erast yes by her cousin mary queen of france and scotland and this ladys cause was supported by the popish faction but it ended in the fall of mary for when her husband the king of france died she came over to england where by a breach of hospitality elizabeth seized her person kept her confined eighteen years d then brought her to a sham trial and cut off her head   eugen did the neighboring nations disturb the ign of this queen   erast very little elizabeth had a great deal of t and cunning and contrived by somenting disputes on the continent and setting the states there at variance ong each other to divert their attention in a great meare from this kingdom her brotherinlaw philip ii ng of spain who would have married her on the death  her sister sent a large fleet to invade this country but  the skill and courage of the admirals and the favor of ovidence this fleet called the spanish armada was estroyed the spaniards are said to have lost    ships of ar and    00 men   eugen such a blow could not be owing to an engement   erast not wholly so they suffered much before our ns but more by a storm for the seas and a tempest ished the destruction a which the english arms begun   eugen how long did elizabeth reign   erast forty five years she died in   0  in the ventieth year of her age but not before the people were ed of her this is evident from the general joy testified  all ranks at the accession of her successor james vi  scotland son of that mary she had put to death   eugen what relation was james to elizabeth   erast third cousin james was the son of mary d mary was the granddaughter of elizabeths aunt e sister of henry viii thus were the two countries of england and scotland united under one monarch  king james came to the throne with the universal approation of all orders of the state for in his person was unit every claim to the crown that either descent bequest  parliamentary sanction could confer   eugen did james in no wise resent the putting his other to death   erast he made an attempt to invade england with  army but policy soon induced him to drop it england ing too powerful at that time however when he came to the throne he would not wear mourning for elizabeth nor suffer any one to appear acourt in black  james began his reign by laboring to unite both kingdoms into one but the jealousy of the english put a st to it for the present lest the offices in the english co and government should be disposed of to scotchmen   eugen were not the kings of scotland more dpotic than the kings of england   erast yes and james wished to govern his english subjects in the same way he did his scotch ones whi occasioned numberless disputes between the king and  parliament he was for raising money occasionally wit out the consent of parliament which the parliament  ways opposed and this matter being carried to great lengths by this son in the next reign cost charles i  life as i shall have occasion to explain to you hereafter   eugen was there not a plot laid in this reign  blow up the parliament with gunpowder   erast there was it was a plot of the roman tholics to destroy the king and parliament at one stro having been refused some indulgencies they requests for this purpose they contrived to stow many barrels gunpowder in the cellars under the parliamentho which they meant to set fire to when the king and parliament were assembled for this deed of desperation number of persons united and how horrid soever the cotrivance every member seemed faithful and secret in  league every thing was prepared to their wishes and  conspirators expected the day with impatience a  morse however of private friendship saved the kingdom when all the ties divine and human were too weak  do it one of the conspirators desirous of saving  life of an intimate friend cautioned him ten days bef the meeting not to attend the house and sent him a myterious letter for this purpose the letter was no foo received than the contents of it were communicated to  secretary of state and the king was the first person  unravelled it is meaning accordingly the cellars we examined the night before the meeting of parliament a  whole plot was discovered the ringleaders were n after discovered and put to death   eugen is it not from a daughter of james i that  present royal family sprung   erast it is this daughter was married to the ctor palatine who soon after became king of bohemia and this lady was the mother of the princess soia mother of george is it   eugen how long did james i reign over this gdom   erast twentytwo years he died in      and is succeeded on the throne by his second son charles i  eldest son henry having died before him   eugen this was the prince that was put to death  the people   erast it was for though no monarch ever came  the throne of england with a greater variety of faurable occurrences yet as his father had considered the yal privileges as sacred pledges and defended them to  utmost of his power by words it was charless misrtune to assert them by action he wanted to govern  people who had for some time learned to be free by axims and precedents that had their origin in times of norance and slavery in short he wanted to be despo and when his parliament was not conformable to his shes he would immediately dissolve it from small ides he proceeded to greater and when the parliament und that the king was disposed to be arbitrary they ere determined to grant no supplies or raise him any oney till their grievances were redressed   eugen i have understood he raised money without e concurrence of his parliament   erast when they would not vote any supplies he id arbitrary impositions on trade which many refused  pay and extorted money from individuals under a prence of borrowing it for as he had a war to maintain ith france and spain large sums of money were continually wanting   eugen and did the parliament raise him no money   erast sometimes it would and sometimes it wo not this so embarrassed him that he proceeded gre lengths to procure it at last the parliament resent it raised an army in their own defense for there was  standing army at that time and the king raised an ar likewise this was the beginning of the civil wars the continued eight years and ended with the execution  the king in        eugen how was that event brought about   erast the parliamentforces were commanded  oliver cromwell and the kings forces by himself a after a variety of battles in different parts of the kindom and a deal of blood shed every where charles w taken prisoner tried for high treason against the sta and beheaded at white hall   eugen what became of his family   erast during the civil wars his queen and so fled to france and were there protected she being  daughter of france   eugen how were matters disposed in englan on the death of charles   erast oliver cromwell who was a leading man  the faction was appointed protector of the kingdom  life and the constitution from being monarchical immediately became republican which continued all cron wells life   discourse iv the same subject continued the third period eugen did charles ii son of the deceased kin take no steps to recover his kingdom   erast he came over to edinburgh was there rceived with all the formalities of a crowned head and ha an army raised in his defense cromwell however marche into scotland and after a little opposition charles  obliged to fly and escaped his pursuers by disguising self in the dress of a peasant   eugen how long was it before charles ii was bred to his succession   erast not till two years after richard cromwell son of oliver had succeeded his father as protector of  commonwealth richard was by no means equal to  father he had nothing active in his disposition had her talents for business any knowledge of government any ambition or importance of course it was planned ng the kings friends to bring him back to the throne   eugen general monck they say was very instruntal to this   erast it was owing chiefly to him he had begun his tune under the command of charles i and was taken soner in his service on the death of his master he  released from a long confinement and had a comnd under cromwell his loyalty however prevailed r every thing and being at the head of   000 scots  determined to restore the royal family but used every caution necessary for their safety and his own being last commander in chief of all the forces in england tland and ireland he marched to london intimidated  parliament and compelled them to a restoration of the al family this took place in    0 and monck went dover and received the young king as he landed   eugen did charles ii on his coming to the throne venge the death of his father   erast in some measure he did the bodies of omwell and some others were taken from their graves agged to the place of execution and there hung up a ole day and afterward buried under the gallows and t of eighty persons then living and concerned in the ath of charles i ten were executed had charles ii en an active monarch he might have been an absolute e for the parliament was all obedience but instead  desiring an ascendency over them he was content to be  humble dependant on their bounty   eugen it was in this kings reign i believe th the great plague ravaged in london   erast this happened in the year      swept  more than  00000 of it is inhabitants and was immdiately followed by a conflagration which burnt f three days and almost destroyed the whole city but t spirit of the people soon surmounted these calamities a london rose more beautiful from it is ruins the city w supposed to have been fired by the roman catholics a the monument in london was erected as memento of the catastrophe   eugen was not charles a man of great gallantry   erast very much so he kept several mistresses and enobled them all from these have sprung several of o noble families the dukes of st alban grafton an richmond as the king was not married and his brother james duke of york was a declared papist the parliament passed a law to exclude him from the throne but notwithstanding this on the death of charles whi happened in      his brother succeeded him as james ii   eugen and without opposition   erast every opposition seemed to vanish at his accession he made an early declaration in favor of the church of england and thus became popular for the people crushed a rebellion of the duke of monmouth wh was a natural son of charles ii and the troubles attending it ended with his excution   eugen what was the duke of monmouths plea f rising   erast he claimed the crown under an idea that the king was married to his mother but it proved otherwise   eugen james however was not a protestant in his heart   erast no he had married a roman catholic lady the daughter of the king of spain had romish priests abou him abetted all of that persuasion and received a nuci or legate from the eope   eugen and what was the consequence   erast the church of england took the alarm and many great men in england and scotland applied for re to william prince of orange who had married ess eldest daughter he was a prince of great abili and a declared enemy of the papists   eugen and what relief did he afford them   erast william being an ambitious prince all his ons were levelled at power and he no sooner received  invitation to come over to england with an army in he equipped a fleet sufficient to transport   000 men mes now saw his errors and would have retracted his asures in favor of popery but it was too late wilm sailed from holland and landed at torbay in denshire with   000 troops the people joined him d the nobility who formed the court and council of king mes left their old master to solicit protection from the w   eugen how did james act in this case   erast he sought assistance from france and germany but in vain he was however at the head of 000 men but when he was told that his favorite ughter ann had gone over to the prince of orange s spirits sunk and meeting with little encouragement om his council he thought of nothing but flying to rance accordingly he sent away his queen and son then  months old and soon after followed himself thus dicating the crown and leaving his daughter mary and her husband in possession of it this event is called the revolution and took place in        eugen what became of him afterward   erast being arrived in france he found protection here and enjoyed for the remainder of his life the mpty title of a king and the appellation of a saint   eugen did he make no attempts to recover his kingdom   erast the french king assisted him with a fleet and some troops to assert his claims and he set sail at breast anded at kinsale in ireland and was received with open rms by the catholics in that kingdom but william followed him there gave him battle at the boyne defeated him and obliged him to fly the kingdom another attempt was made the next year to send a number of french troops into england but the french fleet being opposed by an english one and beaten all future attempt were given over and king james passed the rest of his days at st germains a pensioner on the bounty of the french king the liberality of his daughter and friend in england and died in   00 his son and grandson afterwands made attempts on the crown of england in      and      as i will show hereafter but were also repulsed   eugen how was william received on his coming to london   erast with all the congratulations imaginable the people having prescribed to him the terms by which he was to rule offered him the crown jointly with his wife and they were crowned by the titles of william iii and mary king and queen of england   eugen did william reign after the death of his queen   erast some few years only for he was naturally of a feeble constitution his death was hastened by fall from his horse in march   0  and he was succeeded by anne the next daughter of james ii she was thirtyeight years old when she began to reign and as the french king thought proper to countenance her brother wh was called the pretender she waged war with france the duke of marlborough was her general who was so able and successful as to carry every thing before him he fought a great many battles and gained them all blenheim ramilies oudenarde lafeet etc the manor of woodstock in oxfordshire was conferred upon him for his services and blenheimhouse built for him and now kept up by government   eugen were there any remarkable things happened in her reign   erast gibraltar a fort belonging to the spaniards and deemed impregnable was taken by sir george rooke and continues in our possession to this day  and the union between scotland and england was effected and took place in   0    eugen i think you told me that these countries ere united before by james vi of scotland succeeding to the crown of england   erast i did but this is not the union i mean before   0  the two countries were governed by separate parliaments as at present it is with england and ireland but now the scotch peers choose sixteen of their wn body to represent them in the english parliament and the people of scotland choose fortyfive members ho sit in one house of commons and the scotch parliament exists no longer and from the date of this union he two kingdoms have gone by the name of great britain the subjects of both enjoying a communication f privileges and advantages   eugen had queen anne any issue   erast she was married to george prince of denmark who lived with her and by him had one son who ied before her in his sixteenth year queen anne died in        eugen who succeeded her   erast if you recollect i told you that james the first had a daughter married to the king of bohemia this daughter left a daughter the princess sophia of hanover on whom the parliament of england settled he succession but as she died a few days before queen anne the crown fell to her son george i elector of hanover the fiftyfour years of age for with queen anne ended the family of the stuarts   eugen what is the name of the present royal family   erast gwelph   eugen what became of the son of james ii whom e took over with him to france   erast on the death of his father in   0  he was proclaimed king of england by the french king at st germains and for some time treated as such by the courts of rome france spain and turin he resided at rome where he kept up the appearance of a court and continued firm in the romish faith till his death in      he left two sons charles edward born in    0 who on his fathers death repaired to rome but as the po would not receive him as king of england he return to florence and is now living under the title of co albany henry his second son is a cardinal and know by the name of cardinal york   eugen did not this james the old pretender man an attempt on the crown of england   erast yes in the year      one year after t accession of george the is it he was proclaimed king scotland some noblemen in that country took the fie in his behalf and marched their forces into england be they were soon driven back by the kings forces und the duke of argyl and the pretender himself who land in scotland in the interim was obliged to decamp   eugen by this it appears that the crown of england is by no means hereditary   erast it certainly is hereditary but subject to aterations in that inheritance by the parliament that to say when parliament does not interfere for wise a politic reasons it then descends to the next heir   eugen the succession i find has often been alter   erast it was altered in henry iv henry v and now again in george i   eugen how long did george i reign   erast upwards of twelve years he died sudenly in his journey to hanover in the year      a was succeeded by his son george ii who was much iferior to his father in point of abilities   eugen it was in his reign i believe that the mous sir robert walpole was minister   erast it was and to him chiefly was owing  venality of parliaments for those whom he could  bring over to his measure by true policy and fair reasoing he contrived to buy over by pensions honors a offices   eugen what was the rebellion in this kings rei owing to   erast to an attempt of the old pretenders son recover the crown which his father had failed in   eugen and was he more successful   erast no the french assisting him as they had he his father he landed in scotland in the year       though he brought no troops over with him by means  the chiefs of some highland clans who armed their als he soon found himself at the head of   00 men d invited others to join him he marched into england d his army gathered as it passed he was proclaimed ng of england at edinburgh and promised if he suceded in his enterprized to dissolve the union between england and scotland which was disagreeable to the er orders of the people and to redress all their grievances but it answered no purpose an army was sent t of england against him gave him battle beat him d obliged him to fly again to france as in the rebelon of      some few noblemen that took the lead were headed so it turned out in this many were taken isoners and some put to death   eugen did this young prince readily escape   erast not readily he was an unhappy wanderer ear six months from mountain to mountain a wretched ectator of many executions brought on by his illguided mbition hemmed round by pursuers till at last a vessel om st maloes took him on board and carried him  france in safety   eugen when princes can meet with such misfortunes let private persons who complain of the miseries of fe bless god and be happy   erast misfortunes indeed for thus sunk all the opes and ambition of this young adventurer one short our deprived him of imaginary thrones and sceptres and educed him from a nominal king to a distressed forlorn utcast   eugen what family had george ii   erast he had two sons and several daughters his ldest son frederick father of the present king died rince of wales george ii died suddenly in october    0 aged seventysix after reigning thirty two years and was succeeded by his grandson our present king son of frederick prince of wales to acquaint you with he many occurrences of this reign as they are chiefly within your own memory would be useless i shall  mention to you the loss of our colonies in america  in the year      an act was passed here for laying stampduty on the british colonies of north america which the people there thought an infringement on the privileges as by their charters they claimed a right raising the quota they were obliged to pay toward  support of government in their own way for they  assemblies or parliaments of their own as we have  soon as it was known in north american that this act  passed the whole continent was in a flame and all  stamped paper sent over was burnt as soon as land when the minister here was informed of this they ga the matter up and an act was passed to repeal the one th was so obnoxious and all things were quiet again b a year or two after the british parliament not being abl to lay an absolute duty or tax on any commodity sent on to america as this would be raising money on the people without their own consent attempted to affect the same thing in another way for to enable the east india company to pay the state a large annual tribute they allowe them to export their teas dutyfree the americans  ware of this contrivance opposed it unanimously burn all the tea there imported and in      boarded sever ships in boston harbor and threw the cargoes of tea in the water  this conduct excited so much indignation in the government of england that they proceeded to rigorous measures they blocked up the port of boston and would  suffer it to have any trade the americans now combined raised an army and a civil war was the consequence this was continued to the year      when it ended  the sovereignty and independence of that country an was the greatest loss this nation ever sustained   ome boy learn to be wise discourse i by way of introduction erastus and eugenius erast this is just what i wished for an agreeable shade let us sit down eugenius  profit by it   eugen for my part sir i am not the least gued i could walk here from morning to night hout being weary   erast at your age i should have said the same s you as old as me you would hold a different language   eugen it is very true but before i reach forty years i have please god a long way to go   erast alas my child though you should live enty thirty fifty years that interval which seems  you so considerable will escape you as a fleeting dow it is very remarkable that the more our  advances the shorter our years seem to be in ancy weeks appear to be months and months ars   eugen and why this   erast because at that time life exempt in embarrassment from care and anxiety is wholly  voted to pleasure but no sooner are we entered in  busy scene of the world than care chagrin and busin crond in upon us and succeed with so much rapid that we are scarce sensible of our existence you a my dear eugenius in the very springtide of life a it would be a blessed time if you were thoroughly sesible in what true happiness consists man if i m use the expression goes out of the hands of nat pure full of innocence and candor peace joy  liveliest and purest pleasures divide his hours he  like a young plant which grows and which wa only the care of a skilful and industrious hand to bra it up an ornament to the garden the infant mind  like soft wax to which we may give any kind of fon the soul at that period free from prejudice from vice from those passions that tyrannize over the greatest part of mankind is susceptable of good  virtuous impressions the mind is a fertile field the requires only good culture and good seed to make bring forth in due season a plentiful harvest  short can we suppose eugenius that man wo ever become so vicious and so wicked if his mind  early formed to virtue   eugen i hope sir you do not allude to me this for i should be unhappy if you thought me of wicked turn if you will assist me with your advi probably i may be as good as you can wish   erast that i will with pleasure and if  second my intentions you will one day be not on pleased with me but with yourself  you are no longer my dear eugenius in the infant state of life when man is too weak to listen the voice of reason you are sixteen years of age time when the mind begins to open and form a judgment of what it sees a time when young men  capable of perceiving and knowing what is to contute their wellbeing could i have the happine my friend to make you sensible from this moment the value of a good education how estimable m  and of what use knowledge is in the commerce of  you would be enflamed with a desire to learn and know what is it that distinguishes one man from other but his capacity and knowledge does not e ignorant man he who has no talent no acquision resemble the brute beast who knows only how  eat to drink and to sleep whereas he who has understanding and knowledge is distinguished every here he is useful to himself and to society and is an honor to human nature whilst neglect and contempt er accompanies him who is devoid of merit the man f understanding has a thousand advantages and is evered and respected by all who know him   eugen i should be really ashamed to be reoached with want of understanding   erast well then my dear let us endeavor o avoid it let us apply ourselves with alacrity charmed with the emulation i discover in you i will ouble my attention to you i will not consider you s a boy but as a reasonable young man as my friend hitherto in our walks we have discoursed of rifles and a thousand indifferent things that answered ut little purpose in future our conversations shall be more interesting more instructive and at the same ime far more agreeable   eugen with all my heart sir and upon what shall they turn   erast upon the most useful and more necessary knowledge in the commerce of life that state of life to which you are called will you not rejoice to know the nature of the world and what is done in it we will turn our thoughts to every thing about us we will study the great book of nature we will contemplate the productions of the creator and we shall then see throughout the most striking proofs of his power his wisdom and his love to man do you approve of the plan   eugen certainly sir but if it should happen that at any time i should misunderstand you you will excuse the liberty i shall take in asking a further explanation   erast without doubt you shall ask me wh you please and i will satisfy you to the best of  knowledge and be assured the more questions you  me the better pleased i shall be but do not imag i am proposing to you a study or a disquisition  subjects no my friend our conversation shall be real amusement and you will be surprised to fin that in the course of our evening walks you will  prove fast in knowledge even without pains an without study i will endeavor however to thro your thoughts into some order lest want of arrangement should lead you to forget what you hear   discourse ii on the nature of man and of education erast agreeable to our plan my dea eugenius let us begin by casting o eyes upon ourselves and endeavor to know who an what we are   eugen is it possible that we can need an enqui of this kind are you not erastus and am i no eugenius   erast such is not the knowledge i allude to i would have you learn at least femember that you are man   eugen that i am man do not i know th already   erast i believe you know it but i am certain that you have thought very little about it and th you have not yet entered into the distinction between man and other creatures about him by what chan is it that you and i and all the persons upon earth are what we are   eugen it is not chance that has made us wh we are but god   erast you are right we owe to god alone ry advantage that we have and that we are such ngs as we find ourselves clothed walking disrsing in a word thinking and rational animals ilst there are upon the earth a prodigious quantity  creatures of a different kind but tell me why are ey not called man as well as us since they are born ow and die like us   eugen because they are not endowed with ason   erast true it is reason that essentially disguishes us from brutes but what is it that disguishes man and brutes from all these plants from is tree for example which lives and grows like us d like that colt that bounds across the meadow   eugen i know no difference unless it be that i d that animal utter sounds run jump whereas the ee neither speaks nor moves   erast but this stone which i touch with my foot equally dumb and immovable and yet it is neither tree nor a plant learn then the principal difference between a brute a plant and a stone the brute es and at the same time has certain senses the plant es also but has no sense and as to the stone it has neither life nor sense  we have in common with the brutes the natural nses of the body for example sight smell hearg tasting and feeling and in general in animals ey are more delicate than in man the cat has a etter sight the dog a better scent and the hare a reater power of hearing the plant has nothing in ommon with man and brute but life that is to say egetation the stone has nothing in common with ther one or the other but the substance or matter of which it is composed we are formed from the dust f the earth and to that dust we shall return  let us look into ourselves now god alone has made us what we are were we to examine the ructure of our bodies we should find that the miutest part of us is finely formed to answer the purpose or which it was designed our whole frame is such an xquisite piece of mechanism as no human art could complete could we see our internal make we should stand much more amazed than we do in examining t work of a watch and to the curious philosophic ey we should appear as much more beautiful than we na rally are as the inside of a watch is more beautiful th when covered with its cases god having then forme us as we are had he pleased he could have continue us in our original nothingness but he thought prope to draw us forth and place us here upon the earth among milions of objects of which the earth is fu he has in short made us man and what is th human individual is he not the most noble creat that has issued from the hand of the almighty th only animal that reasons thinks can reflect upon itself and raise its mind even to the author of its being in a word is he not the monarch of all that exists have you ever attended to that preeminence of m over all the other objects of nature do you comprehend the greatness of your privileges what thi you of this eugenius   eugen i am confounded and astonished sir  what you tell me from this moment only have begun to perceive the remarkable kindness of th creator in making me what i am i own till now i never turned my thoughts upon the subject   erast is it sufficient to be sensible of the to vantages god has given us is there nothing owing to the giver of them   eugen certainly sir our gratitude and than are due to him   erast we not only owe him gratitude but a our love and as we receive every good gift from him to whom should we apply in any of our wants but to him hence then the necessity of our religious duties it is our duty not only to thank him and to hono him but also to pray to him in performing this duty we do no more than what is right than what good sense and the sentiments of the heart point out na were we placed here on earth merely as the brut to live and die and without any other hope we shou equally owe a homage to the divinity for endow in us with reason and making us so much superior  her animal but when we come to consider the any acts of kindness our creator has bestowed upon  we should fail in our duty if we did not give him  all our heart and all our love but is there nothing e that distinguishes us from brutes   eugen we have a soul that shall never die   erast there lies the preeminence that chiefly arks the difference between men and brutes and ery other animal on the face of the earth our odies which are merely organized earth will share e fate of other animals but the more noble part of s the soul is ordained to live for ever now why s god given us this immortal soul how ought it  be attended to you cannot be ignorant of this ou must remember the many lessons on this subject ou have been taught in your childhood but i wish to ow what consequences you draw from the reflection at though the body be born to die the soul will ever die   eugen it seems natural to conclude that we ught to live well since the soul after death will be ernally happy or unhappy according to our conduct  this life   erast true my friend you enter perfectly unto my ideas i am charmed to find you compreend that man is born for an end worthy of himself this is the point i am at nothing is more imporant ant than to think of ones latter end st bernard sed frequently to say to himself bernard for what nd did you come into the world and surely an ternity of happiness or misery is no trifling matter he who does not study it is little else than a mad man yes my dear eugenius to live as if we were not to die or as if we had nothing after death either o hope or to fear is the height of blindness it is to forget that we are men it is in short to debase ourselves below the brute creation under the want of such a thought the state of brutes would be the most preferable for if they have nothing to hope for after death they have nothing to apprehend so that all they do in life is indifferent but man is capable of good and evil and you find that it is not a matter of indifference to him for if he acts well he will bewarded eternally if ill he will be punished t the essential business of man during his short stay  earth is reduced to the necessity of living well th world is to him merely a place of passage and is inn in his journey to the next and it is in this ro through life that he is to take care not to lose his wa fince if through misfortune he has taken the wro road he is loft without recovery   eugen men should therefore be extremely catious and enquire the right road before they proce upon their journey and when on it submit to  calamity that may befall them rather than be put o of their way   erast admirably said it is instruction al that can teach man how to proceed that is to say h he ought to live so as to act conformably to the defi for which his creator made him then how is the instruction to be acquired but by education my d eugenius you have brought me yourself to th subject on which i designed to talk to you i mean  education of youth and i hope you will attend to its consequences   eugen i certainly conceive that education necessary for without it how can we know what  ought to know   erast true children are capable of northi by themselves they know nothing but what oth take the trouble to teach them of course how gre a misfortune must it be to want the advantages of edcation judge by what you see every day how  you find those children whose parents take no  care   eugen oh sir they are wicked quarrelson always ready to do evil to ill treat and injure o another some will swear and say the worst of thin they pay no respect to persons they are disobedie untractable and slothful they love nothing but run about and play the fool should they somein go to church it is only to laugh and make remarks others without attending to the holiness of the pla and the great majesty of the divinity that dwells the   erast you have given a tolerable good picture those unhappy people but what think you of the rents of such children   eugen i think their parents very culpable and at they will have to answer to god for their neglect their children must in such a case turn out very d   erast nothing is more true i deplore the fate those thoughtless parents who have not discharged is sacred duty they will one day have a terrible account to give was i a legislator i would impose e severest penalties on such fathers and mothers who ave it in their power to instruct their children and yet mit to do it they are not only the cause of sending broad into the world as many bad members of ociety as they have children but it is probable that ose bad children will also neglect the education f their descendants and from this unfortunate proression a multitude of bad citizens may arise from he neglect of their ancestors do you feel the force of this reasoning   eugen very sensibly   erast an anecdote of ancient history will make ou conceive the advantages of a good education still etter lycurgus the lacedemonian lawgiver derous of showing his people how necessary it is to form outh early if we would make them useful to the ate took two little dogs of the same species and rought them up in a very different manner one he ndulged in every thing the other he inured to the hace when age had strengthened their bodies and confirmed them in what they had been accustomed to e brought them out into a public place in presence of all the citizens whom he had convened together and having set before these two dogs some dressed ood he turned loose a hare before them one of the two dogs immediately fell to devouring the meat to which he had been accustomed the other set off after the hare which it presently caught all the people applauded his design when lycurgus addressing the assembly said thus these two dogs are of the same species see what a difference edution has made between them   eugen lycurgus could not give posterity a m useful lesson it is astonishing that i should never ha thought of this oh sir if children conceived a conceive at present the inestimable value of edution they would be more attentive and more wise the they are   erast alas did they but know how well  wish them were they sensible of the many anxio hours we pass on their account they would be mo grateful than they are but come i see you are dposed to listen to instruction and i will do my utmo to make you acquainted with every thing a young m ought to know our first conference shall be a god the author of all things but we will defer the subject till we have more time to spare   discourse iii on god the creation and fall of man erast of all the truths my dear eugenius which religion teaches the first and the rest is the knowledge of a supreme being the author and creator of all things how do you apprehend i shall prove the existence of this sovereign arbiter of nature   eugen nothing seems more easy sir when i see a fine building i say to myself this superb edifice has been erected with great order and regularity an able architect and ingenious workmen have been its contrivers and executors so when i think of the world and all the wonders i behold in that world i naturally cry out certainly these things must have in the workmanship of an almighty power and s power is the god i adore   erast you reason right to be convinced of e existence of a sovereign wisdom it is sufficient  open our eyes and look about us if the considetions of the heavens and the stars their beauty eir brightness their regularity and their wonderful volutions so constant and exact will not convince us this truth we shall find it strongly imprinted in the aves and upon the shores of the sea in plants in the roduction of herbs and fruits in the variety and stinct of animals in the structure of our bodies and n the features of our faces in short god having reated us for himself he has graven in our hearts the truth of his existence there is no people nor any ation even the most savage who have not an idea of a divinity it is true some pay their homage to objects unworthy of their veneration but it is for want of a more enlightened understanding and a better nformation   eugen they may have abilities to conceive but no person to direct their conceptions to the right object   erast this is one of the best remarks i have heard upon the subject and convinces me i shall not lose my time and labor in endeavoring to improve you let us then enquire into the nature of god as far as our capacities will carry us but at best we can have but a very imperfect idea of him and we can know no more of his attributes than he has condescended to discover in the old and new testaments which are the writings of inspired authors dictated by god himself and as such are the precious deposites of our faith  now the attributes are there declared to be that he is independent that is that he is selfexistent deriving his existence from no other being that he is eternal that is to say that he never had a beginning nor ever will have an end that he is infinite by this we mean that he has an unlimited power and possesses all imaginable perfections in a sovereign degree that he is a pure spirit having neither body figure nor color of course that he cannot bel perceived nor touched   eugen permit me sir to interrupt you  you say that god has neither body nor figure  then is mention made of his hands and feet ho it said that he appeared to the patriarchs   erast man being limited in his understandi was the deity not described to him in terms  which he is acquainted he could have no concept of what is told him it is for this reason that st terms are made use of and when we are told in  scriptures that god spoke and showed himself to m we are to understand that it was an angel only w descended in the name of the most high and appear in human form to communicate to men the orders the supreme being  another attribute of the deity is immensity the is to say he fills all space and is at one and the fa moment in all parts of the universe confined to no particular spot or place  he is also immutable that is not subject to chang if it be said in the scriptures that god is angry  that he repents we are not to understand by thi passion or change but these so described to us th we may comprehend them  he knows all both the present the past and th future nothing is hid from him and he penetrates the very thoughts of the heart  he is almighty for he would cease to be god i his power was not immense and absolute  he has drawn from nothing every thing that exis and that by the sole act of his will let there b light said he and there was light  he preserves all creatures and guards their existence continually for if he ceased to support them they would sink into that nothingness from whence h first formed them  in short nothing happens in this world without hi order and permission god then disposes all the event of the world the smallest action of every creature the least thought of the mind is all regulated by his ite wisdom and in this administration this goment of the universe which seems to us so imose but which to him cost far less trouble than king of the eye to us he had no other object in  than the manifestation of his glory to all created gs   eugen but sir of god consulted only his glory ll that passes here why does he permit for exle the many disorders which reign among men   erast he permits evil to draw from it a greater d if he afflicts good men in this life it is to red their virtues in another if he gives the wicked sitory prosperity he makes use of their malice er to exercise his justice or his mercy upon his tures such is my friend the idea which god given us of himself and of his attributes   eugen what idea have you of angels   erast my idea of angels is that they are spial creatures not formed with bodies of course not ble of being seen perceived or touched for the re of a spirit is to have neither body form nor ur and if some angels have appeared to men  mentioned just now by order of the almighty  have put on an apparent body rather than a one  ngels were created for eternal life that is never e to know god as he is and to enjoy him ever gly they are endowed with a very pure underding so as to know what is good with a will well sed to love and every necessary grace for contig in the love of the creator and enjoying everg happiness  any of them however lost themselves by their  fancying themselves more perfect than god elf or at least coveting to partake with the sue being the exercise of his almighty power they  to withdraw themselves from his control the  to punish this audacious sacrilege of their black titude threw them headlong down into a dreadful  called hell where remorse and despair will for forment them the rebellious angels are called  powers of hell demons malicious spirits and angels of darkness and we have given to o whom we suppose their chief the name of satan   eugen are these demons then confined in he if so why is it said that the devil is roaming abo seeking whom he may devour   erast these fallen spirits suffer that eternal punishment due to their rebellion but this does  prevent many of them wandering over the earth u the day of judgment these are constantly end vouring to draw men into sin that they may ha companions in their misfortune   eugen but sir why does god who is infinite good suffer them to seduce mankind   erast for the same reason that i told you permitted evil that he may draw from it a great good we are to resist the temptations of the de and he that resists them will have everlasting life   eugen can you give me a better idea of  creation than what the scriptures afford   erast all our information on this head is gathed from the scriptures that historical part written moses i may possibly help you to form some oception of it but the whole can only be imagina it is supposed that this globe that is the ex for we can speak only of the planet we inhabit  before the creation a confused mass of matter which we have given the name of chaos that tho the almighty took the space of six days to compl his purpose he could have given being to every th at one and the same instant for he had only to wi to say let it be and it was having in one created the light in another the heavens and earth in a third the waters in a fourth the  the moon and the stars in a fifth the inhabitance the air and the waters that is birds and fishes on the sixth day created every terrestrial animal done desirous of giving the world so formed a ma and placing upon earth a rational creature who m partake with the angels before created the hness of praising the lord he made man after his image that is the soul of man in imitation  rational faculties though in a much inferior deg   eugen he was formed we are told of the earth   erast we are to suppose he formed his body of  earth and then breathed into him a living soul ich is the principle of human life   eugen i have been always given to understand  that the blood is the principle of life for if we re to take from a man all the blood in his veins he uld die   erast it is true that such a man could not live  we must not hence conclude that the blood is the inciple of life it is only the instrument and there a great deal of difference between the principle and  instrument in writing would you say it is the pen at writes it is the pen certainly that traces the aracter but it is the hand that directs the pen and  soul that guides the hand in the same manner  soul gives motion to the blood and directs the cirlation and as this motion and circulation is the strument of life it follows that the soul which directs em is the principle   eugen as the soul is so necessary let me know you please its nature   erast the soul is an immortal spirit created ter the image of god  in the first place it is spiritual that is to say it has  same properties as angels have to have neither dy figure nor color of course not to be seen erceived or touched it is thus reason proves its irituality  it is in the second place immortal that is to say ll exist for ever not independent of god but with  permission for as he created the soul he could ertainly annihilate it   eugen in what manner is the soul and body ed   erast it is impossible to answer that question t by conjecture it being one of the mysteries of ure of which we are at present unacquainted we e convinced of the union but no one can tell how ll that experience will permit us to say is that the ul continues with the body whilst the body preserves e organs necessary to carry on the different operations of the soul and that it leaves it when the harmony this wonderful machine is destroyed then man ce to be for that which constitutes man properly speing is the union of soul and body   eugen how did god form the soul of the  man   erast the scriptures teach us that god hing formed the body of earth breathed into it  it became a living soul but what is this breath god the expression can only indicate the spiritual of the soul   eugen you will excuse sir my impertin questions curiosity which brought on this gr subject leads me to it i have but one more to  and that is whether god creates every soul in unit it with the body or whether the soul of man althou spiritual and immortal is an emanation of and sprit from the soul of adam our first parent   erast some of the fathers of our church h refused to decide upon this question but st jer st ambrose and others have taught that god crea every soul when he unites it with the body thi the general opinion of divines as conformable to b writ   eugen i have often enquired whethe ani have souls but could never get a right answer   erast men are divided upon this subject so have thought they have but the far greater p believe the contrary as you have read the b through and through and are tolerably well inform in scripture history give me an account eugeni of the creation of the first woman   eugen after god had created man we are t that the lord threw adam into a deep sleep  whilst he slept took from him one of his ribs  which he formed the woman called her eve and psented her to adam when he awoke and that ad at first seeing her cried this is bone of my b and flesh of my flesh therefore shall a man l his father and mother and cleave unto his  and they shall be one flesh   erast and do not you remark in these words  institution of marriage   eugen clearly but there is one thing that barrasses me much in this account it is not said t god gave a soul to eve as he did to adam ve women therefore no souls   erast it was not necessary that the scriptures uld say so god in creating woman designed to ke her a fit companion for adam to do this he ld do no less than endow her as he did the man h reason and give her a soul with the same propers and privileges   eugen how is it then that we see the generality women have less understanding than the men   erast be cautious how you give into this it certainly true that a great number of women have t faculties equal to a like number of men but this ference rises not from the nature of the soul but m want of equal education and from the delicacy  their frame  the education of girls is very much neglected parularly among the better sort of people instead of plying to study their time is spent in trifles and curious idleness which enervates their mind and akens their bodies and what is the result they ow what they ought to be ignorant of and are norant of what they ought to know but let us proed on the subject we were upon  after the creation of the man and the woman god o formed them only to make them happy placed em in a delightful garden where nature seemed to ve collected all her riches they were to cultivate d take care of this terrestrial paradise of which god ve them the command except of one tree which he rbad them to touch upon pain of death the culvation of this garden whilst man continued innocent  as not a work of labor as the earth produced every ing spontaneously that is of itself but a sweet and anquil employ which varied every instant and furshed them with motives to adore and praise the unty of the creator blessed with the natural lights  which man is capable we do not trace in adam and eve any of that gross ignorance which obscu our understanding in the instant of our birth  defect in judgment and reason tarnished the beauty  their minds they were at full liberty to act as the pleased and had a will well disposed to do righ without any determined inclination to evil god g them all the assistance all the grace necessary if the made a proper use of it to procure them eternal life and without which they could not obtain it but gardless of their interest they sinned   eugen and how   erast i told you that god left them at  liberty to make free with every thing in the garde but one tree which he called the tree of knowledge good and evil because in abstaining from it they would have been happy and have known no evil wherea eating of that tree they became unhappy and consequently by fatal experience became acquainted wi evil   eugen was it not an apple tree   erast that is of little consequence the wo which the scriptures express it by is that which w translate apple though it expressed in general all tree that bore fruit   eugen but why did god lay our first pare under such a prohibition   erast to give them an opportunity of desening by their obedience the happiness he designe for them and remark the goodness of the lord eve in this prohibition he might have contented himse with simply forbidding man the use of that dangerou fruit but no he laid before him the consequences  his disobedience and the misfortunes that would follo his transgression we read however that in spite  such interdiction the devil in the form of a serpen tempted eve to eat and she prevailed with her husban to do the same   eugen what happened to them after this   erast guilt stared them immediately in t face they became instantly sensible of their crim and god to punish their disobedience told the m that the earth should henceforth produce thorns abriers and that he should eat his bread in the sweat  his brow and as to the woman that she should ng forth children with pain and be under the conul of her husband all her life but this was not all y were from that instant made subject to infirmis and death their inclinations got an evil way and lined them to sin their liberty was abridged and ey had not the power of doing right with the same diness as before they lost the command which od gave them over the brute creation and as they volted against god so the brutes revolted against em and they were both disgracefully driven out of radise without a possibility of returning in short bject to the empire of satan heaven for which ey were created was shut against them and they erited everlasting damnation   eugen in what part of the world was paradise tuated   erast in the holy land between the conence of the rivers euphrates and tigris and their paration   eugen the punishment however seems to me rrible and i had almost dared to say excessive   erast you would think differently if you condered the infinite greatness of the person offended esides how easy was the task enjoined it was in the ords power to have returned them into that nothingess from whence his goodness drew them and as he id not do it it was a mercy   eugen so far i agree sir but why should he ring us all into the world guilty of a crime we never ommitted why should he entail the punishment upon all his posterity   erast i love to hear your reasoning had adam and eve obeyed god and by such obedience have erited the happiness annexed to their fidelity would ou have asked why their posterity reaped the fruits of their deserts   eugen i certainly should not   erast then why ask why we are born guilty of his crime i will admit there is something incomrehensible in this transmission of original sin but man is incomprehensible even without this sin  having however clearly revealed this article of  faith in the scriptures the church teaches it  it is on this belief that the whole extent of reli is founded   eugen and why so sir if you please   erast because it is this doctrine which supp the necessity of the incarnation the death the rrection and ascension of jesus christ the baptis infants and the urgency of prayer repentance  other christian duties   eugen you will pardon my want of comprehsion but this does not appear to me very clear   erast i will explain it then had god trea man as he deserved he would have abandoned him his sentence and have doomed him to eternal mis with the rebellious angels but by an effect of  infinite mercy which ever disarms his justice  wished to draw man from that misery into which  crime had plunged him for this purpose he detmined to send his only son into the world to die  and thus satisfy his justice for the sins of man  after having passed sentence on the man a woman for their offense he condemned the serpe whose form the devil and assumed to crawl upon its belly all its life and among other things he  a continual enmity between him and man saying  the posterity of the woman should bruise his head words by which the almighty announced to morta the miraculous birth the victory and empire of  redeemer over sin and satan to accomplish  promise the son of god was in after times born of pure virgin and by his death reconciled us  the almighty father and it will be our faults no if we are not everlastingly happy   eugen you talk now of the son of god and the father as there is in reality but one god apprehend it is a mystery that cannot be unravelled   erast it is the trinity is past our comphension but we flatter ourselves it will appear v clear to us in a future state when we shall see god and know him as he is god in his holy scripture hought proper to declare that father son and  ghost though described as three are only one ence and equally eternal and if we are not able to prehend it it is because we have no intelligible  to express it by you may possibly form some  of its from comparison the soul is but one yet it has an understanding that knows a will  determines and a memory that can recollect things now these three faculties are very diffe and yet exist in one and the same soul  o the sun is the principle of light and heat both one and the other are as old as the sun for the  cannot subsist a moment without shining and by ing it gives both light and heat you see there that there are things in ourselves and in nature ld as the principle from which they spring as ily therefore may we believe that though in  work of our redemption the father is said to  his son the son to obey the father and the y ghost to apply the infinite merits of the son to kind yet they are not inferior one to another  that the union between the three is so great  in speaking of one of them it may necessarily y our meaning to the other two   eugen but if this redeemer was so necessary y did not god send him upon the earth immediately er the fall of the first man   erast because he would have men learn by the erience of four thousand years the necessity of  measure   eugen are all men damned then who were in before the birth of our savior   erast by no means the lamb of god says john was sacrificed before the creation of the rld that is to say god not only formed the nal decree of the death and passion of christ but  took care that the merits of the sacrifice he made on the cross should reach back to the beginning of e so that all mankind from adam until now ve received the benefits of it all that man had  do before the redemption was to believe in one god adore and serve him anxiously waiting for  hoping in a future deliverer   eugen i am very desirous of knowing sir  men began to form themselves into societies an enter into all the luxuries and indulgences of  can you give me any information on this head   erast though it pleased the creator to be upon man every thing that was necessary for existence and he was formed to live upon the nat productions of the earth yet he endowed him  a thirst for indulgences and without such a th societies could neither flourish nor exist without desire indeed for indulgences our intellectual faties would be a disadvantage to us we sh languish away our hours in stupidity occupied  with the momentary want it is the idea only of proving our situation and adding to our happi that urges us to the trouble of thinking   eugen i apprehend men were first in a saw state and it was a desire of improving this situ that led them to form societies   erast exactly so man originally lived  hunter state and depended upon his bow for daily subsistence so that it required an exten district of land to maintain a tribe of men for  not a small spot that will maintain a number people who are to live upon wild animals taken  hunting as men therefore grew populous tha increased in number they found it necessary to tivate land in order to procure them food and  cultivation led on to society for when they bec possessed of property it was necessary to guard  property from encroachments hence the law mm and jm that is from this time they pceeded to defend their property by law and w they could preserve it they endeavored to encr it they built houses furnished those houses  each head of a family became a husbandman   eugen i can readily conceive that by  means a very large stock of provision might be acmulated   erast yes more than enough this ind numbers to turn their talents to other things some loyed themselves in making untesils others in icating clothes and sundry necessaries which  gave in exchange for corn and other producs of the land it is easy to conceive from hence  societies grew and became flourishing   eugen the method of exchanging property  have been exceedingly inconvenient   erast in large purchases between men of opue the inconvenience might not be great but in ll purchases such exchanges must have been ublesome it was this that gave rise to the inven of money which is easily carried and by general currence is a very good substitute for any kind of modity we may wish to give in exchange for aner we are more in want of and that this money uld never vary it was thought proper to place it  the hands of government and protect it by the wer of the laws   discourse iv general idea of study and  of the arts and sciences eugen i am delighted sir with the information you are pleased to give me and  plan of study you have laid down for me and if  knew in what situation of life i should be thrown to i would request you to give me some directions  my conduct   erast may that happy disposition of yours be sting god will not fail to assist your intentions in at is right and honest it is no matter what situaon of life you are in no man in any situation can  respectable without honor without prudence d without abilities   eugen a great deal depends upon the ma of our education   erast true man is like a tree look yo to the banks of that river to the right and lef can see that those two rows of elms have been u the direction of different men one row  young has been better trained up than the o you may see they are of the same species by the  and the bark and the soil of both is of the f quality take notice of this row how  neat and well cut how green and flourishi how spreading and majestic there is scarce a  through any of their bodies in short there is fault to be found with them but they afford  greatest prospect of turning out fine timber  your eyes now on the other row see how scrubb knotty crooked and full of moss and cankers  are ragged bark yellow leaves with small with heads whence now arises the difference in t two rows of trees if not in the manner in which t were trained when young one was certainly atteed to and the other neglected and there is  doubt but that in time one row will turn out exclent timber for building while the other will be only for the fire   eugen a very striking comparison it bri to my mind the story you told me of lycurgus  his dogs and all you have said on the differ effects of education but is it necessary that all  world should receive all education equally goo should the poor and the working part of mankind educated in the same manner as the rich   erast no that is not necessary different esta of men and different faculties should be differen educated but no person should be deprived of a gious and a virtuous education let a mans profe be ever so low if he is an honest man industrious  a good workman he will be always respectable  the better instructed he has been the more subsive obliging and respectful you will see him  he will acquit himself in his work with the m courage and cleverness in short you will be m pleased with him than one less instructed and will emy him in preference such is the fruit of education  the lower class of people as well as in the upper   eugen i see instances of it every day but pray l me what is the use of a university education   erast i am very much pleased with this question  was my design to give you a succinct idea of the obt of study and of the sciences and arts   eugen what are the liberal arts   erast we call those arts liberal in contradistinction  working trades which are less honorable and which quire less talents and less knowledge architecture ulpture painting engraving and the like are liberal ts   eugen i have been told that the ancients excelled in chitecture and sculpture who were these ancients d where did they reside   erast the grecians who inhabited greece on e borders of the archipelago now in the possession of e turks they flourished many years before the rth of christ and were renowned for their sculpre and their architecture many antiquities or pieces f ancient sculpture have within these few years back een found buried in the earth in italy and greece here are variet of figures vases and other things in e museum that were dug out of the ruins of herculaum a famous city in the neighborhood of naples at was swallowed up by an earthquake in the year   its ruins were not discovered until wthin these orty years   eugen to profess these liberal arts is it necessary o have an education   erast not a very finished one but we can certainly discern among the professors of these arts those who have studied and have been better instructed than others they require genius and readiness and such as ossess these talents make a greater progress in their rofession than others  there are also the sciences which are principal obects of study indeed without study we cannot acuire any knowledge   eugen pray make me acquainted with the names  the sciences   erast of all the sciences the most essential i moral philosophy that is to say the science that teache us the duties of religion and those of society we live my dear eugenius but to die judge then of the importance of morality which teaches us how to live well so that we may die well but there are other sciences still which are not only useful but entertaining we will run through them as you seem to wish it  we will begin with writing which indeed is rather one of the liberal arts it is truly the art of painting words and of speaking to the eyes and is one of the finest inventions of man to read well is also very useful good reading is as it were a comment upon the subject it explains it as it goes on besides to read ill is a mark of want of education and nothing is so vulgar it looks as if we did not understand what we read  a principal perfection in writing is orthography can you tell me in what this consists   eugen it is to spell the words right   erast it is to write correctly and grammatically to spell the words properly and use right stops is a mark of good sense and a good education it is the first thing we judge by now the best way to acquire this is to accustom ourselves to copy with attention some pages of a book correctly printed nothing serves more to mark a gentleman and man of understanding than a proper choice of words this is chiefly acquired by reading but to assist on this subject let me recommend you to a book i have published for the purpose it points out the distinction between words esteemed synonimous in the english language and will be found of use to such as wish to speak or write with propriety and elegance sold by r baldwin paternosterrow price three shillings and sixpence   another knowledge as necessary as writing is arithmetic without which a tradesman cannot carry on his business and a gentleman is liable to be cheated every day in arithmetic lies the whole art of calculation there is indeed another method of calculating and a much shorter one i mean algebra but it is very difficult and but little used  will you know what is taught at the universities   eugen i shall be happy to hear but first explain to me the nature of a university   erast a university is a seminary or school for earned men and such as every wise government thinks right to establish within their dominions some countries have many some fewer england has two oxford and cambridge scotland has four edinburgh glasgow aberdeen and st andrews and ireland has one established at dublin each of these universities consists of one or more colleges with certain endowments government having granted them charters with certain privileges large sums of money have been given from time to time by well disposed persons to found certain houses or colleges in those owns in oxford there are twenty colleges in cambridge sixteen in dublin but one each of these colleges are through noble contributions of the rich in possession of estates sufficient to maintain a certain number of persons called fellows who live together in society and who employ themselves in educating young men either in law physic or divinity such as go there for study pay for their education and to encourage persons to send their sons to these places there are certain privileges annexed to those on whom the universities shall be pleased to confer a degree or mark of distinction a clergyman cannot hold two livings unless he has taken the degree of master of arts or bachelor of laws in one of our universities nor can he be made a bishop until he has taken a doctors degree so likewise in physic a physician cannot practice as such until he has taken the degree of a doctor of physic and before these degrees are given the candidates for those honors are examined as to their proficiency in the science they profess   eugen it is a very laudable institution i have heard of doctors of music what are they   erast music and poetry are held there a sciences and degrees are occasionally given in both the degree of doctor of laws is rather an honorary degree and is frequently given to noblemen and other great personages as a compliment there is a certain discipline observed in the universities and they govern by laws of their own   eugen what are the chief studies there   erast besides the general studies of law physic and divinity they give lectures in algebra mathematics astronomy natural philosophy rhetoric and logic   eugen will you be kind enough to explain them separately   erast algebra i have already mentioned  mathematics is the science which contemplates whatever is capable of being numbered or measured  astronomy is the study of the heavenly bodies  natural philosophy is the science of nature it explains the elements air earth fire and water and searches into their causes and effects you see how extensive this branch of science is it includes mathematics and mechanics it comprehends all that respects powers or strength extent measures weights and the machines employed in different arts  rhetoric explains all the figures of beauties of language and serves to give it more energy or more grace it teaches us the difference of style and how to vary it according to the subject matter in short it is the art of oratory whereas logic is the art of close reasoning   eugen but there are other studies than these   erast yes many but not taught and the universities   eugen will you just name them   erast besides the living languages such as french spanish dutch and so on there are the dead languages hebrew greek and latin called dead from not being perfectly spoken any where  jurisprudence is the science of the laws  physic under this head we include anatomy the structure of the human body surgery the art of amputation and healing wounds chemistry or the art of decomsing bodies proper for the use of medicine or of dividing mixing and purifying different metals botany or the study of plants and pharmacy the art of composing medicines  geography shows the situation of countries and the use of maps  geometry is the art of measuring  heraldry is that of knowing the arms of noble families towns and kingdoms  politics is the science of princes and ministers and indeed is the whole art of government  fortification is the science of defending towns against the assault of an enemy  gunnery is the science of artillery teaching the method of using cannon etc  tactics is the science of the army  navigation that of equipping and conducting vessels upon the sea  the manage is the science of horsemanship  agriculture the art of cultivation  architecture the art of building  music the science of composing tunes and pieces of music and  the belles lettres which is polite literature viz poetry history etc  economy is the science of adapting our outgoings to our incomes and regulating our domestic expenses  thus i have run concisely through the principal branches of study some of which it is necessary for all men to be acquainted with   eugen what a crowd of arts and sciences to choose from   erast there are others still but i must pass over them in silence you will acquire a knowledge of them as you advance in the world all i aim at now is to give you at least an idea of the utility and extent of studies you see the different arts they lead to i will explain some of them in our future conversation more particularly but i must repeat here and you will observe it through life that such persons as have received the best principles and who knew how  profit by the instructions that were given them in youth will have infinitely the most honor in the world   discourse v of trade and commerce eugen returning to town sir i passed by several markets what hurry and bustle nothing but provisions and merchandise buyers and sellers every where   erast commerce consists in this and to give you a better insight into it we will go into one of these markets here then we are what a crowd take notice what a number of empty carts and wagons there must have been a great sale of corn to day   eugen is not that so much the better   erast certainly   eugen and why   erast you do not know then that wheat is the most essential of all merchandise being the first necessary what would become of the inhabitants of a city if those if the country were to discontinue bringing wheat to market for only six weeks there would  no bread the poor would die with hunger and the rich would be embarrassed with their money they could not eat gold and silver you may judge from this of the benefits we derive from agriculture and know that of all merchandise the necessaries of life an powerfully interested to encourage the commerce o corn for the more open and unrestrained that commerc is the more likely are towns to be populous and flourishing whereas if cities had no corn market the would soon be deserted grass would grow in the streets and the inhabitants would be more miserable than the villagers themselves but let us go on we shall come presently to the beast market   eugen this is the chicken market i apprehend what a quantity of fowls of all sorts chickens turkies ducks poultry ready for the spit eggs butter cheese fruit and vegetables in abundance   erast thus are towns supplied with provisions take notice what a variety of articles we draw from the country how much do we owe to the industry and care of the husbandman who procures us such things as we could not well do without but this sale of provisions even assists those to live who live in the neighborhood of towns they are all brought to be converted into money   eugen is it not right that they should profit by the fruit of their labors we ought to be obliged to them even though we pay them for they work for us as well as for themselves but let us pass to the beast market i see a prodigious multitude of horses cows sheep and pigs what a crowd of people there is about them is it a good thing sir to have such large markets of cattle   erast certainly the better a market is served the greater the variety we can then have such cattle as we want and such as please us best every person here in laying out his money helps the tradesman and artist to live for those who receive money for the provisions they bring to market lay it out again in the same town for the necessaries and conveniences they want  to accommodate the people in all towns is the reason of establishing markets once or twice a week and besides these stated days weekly there are particular markets at certain times of the year called fairs these fairs are authorized by government and are established for the benefit of the neighborhood where they are held and for the convenience of selling that merchandise that is produced in the places round about for example some fairs are considerable for the sale of horses others for horned cattle or sheep others for cheese for linens and other things according to the manufactures in the countries where they are held at chester there is a great fair annually for irish linen brought over there by the manufacturers from ireland these fairs or free markets by the certain privileg they have by the abundance and great choice of merchandise they furnish and by the concourse of people they bring together animate commerce and occasion a great circulation of money   eugen i have seen wakes in the north of england where there has been nothing bought or sold   erast but wakes are not fairs a wake is annually held on the feast of the dedication of the parish church that is on the day the church was consecrated and on these festivals every housekeeper keeps an open table and welcome every comer all sorts of rural amusements go forward on these days but it is a day of pleasure and not a day of business   eugen will you stop here much longer   erast no we will go on to the navigable canal   eugen what a number of boats there are there was the canal made on purpose for them   erast it was a single river which nature alone has formed is not in general so strait nor so convenient for the passage of boats rivers generally wind a great deal and have a number of shallow places that are difficult to pass besides rivers do not always run from town to town as these canals are made to do here the banks are made for the purpose of horses to draw the barges along and with wharfs for the convenience of loading and unloading them see how the merchandise is ranged in different places timber firewood bricks paving stones sand coals and other things which are here to be conveyed away in wagons to the places they are going to   eugen canals then are very beneficial to a town   erast very much so towns where there is a port as well as a canal that is where a navigable river joins it flourish very much for such rivers bring a variety of things from the sea and other places out of the reach of a canal and commerce in such a town is much more extended   eugen how is this pray   erast transporting of merchandise by water is much less expensive and more convenient than conveying it by land there now is a boat loaded with coals for this town it is brought from the colliery or coal mine twenty leagues from this place and contains fifty ton weight of coals more than forty wagons with four horses each can draw and yet it is drawn upon the water by eight horses of course here is the expense of one hundred and fitytwo horses and thirtyseven men to drive those horses saved for three men are sufficient to conduct this boat and the eight horses that draw it you see now how money is saved of course the seller of the coals can afford to let his customers have them at a much less price than if they were brought all the way by land carriage it is the same with timber with corn and other merchandise conveyed by water so that the carriage if not quite so expeditious is less expensive   eugen i comprehend it very well and pay who are at the expense of cutting these canals   erast a certain company of gentlemen suppose for example one hundred join one thousand pounds apiece that is one hundred thousand pounds this done they apply to parliament for leave to make the canal and when parliament have passed an act for that purpose allowing them to take passeson it they carry their plan into execution so that each of these gentlemen have one hundredth share in such canal and the profit arising from the toll after the expenses of keeping the banks etc in repair is divided among them in proportion to their shares by which means they get often a large interest for the use of the money so advanced and they can sell their shares at any time turnpike roads are made by the same means and the toll paid at the gates is the property of the persons who contribute to make the road before turnpikes were made the roads were impassible no one therefore should grudge a few pence for the convenience of good roads turnpikes are now made from town to town all over the kingdom and in process of time canals will be as general but if you would see a commercial scene indeed you must go to a seaport   eugen i suppose so   erast you would there see a number of people  all countries and speaking different languages vessel of various structures and different nations some moore in the port others coming in others hoisting their sails to go out french vessels english dutch swedish russia spanish portuguese etc there are vessels tha carry from fifty tons burden to six hundred that is t say large and small that will carry a greater or a le quantity of merchandise each ton is twenty hundre pounds weight in one place upon the stocks are ship building in others upon the beach ships laying on one side to be repaired every ship has its sails its cordage its anchors its boats in short every apparatus necessary to navigation manning a vessel for sea is putting on board a number of men sufficient to navigate her and a pilot to conduct her out of port all these men have pticular offices from the captain to the cabin boy there are ships of war and merchant ships the first belong to the state and are employed for the defense of the kingdom and its colonies and for the protection of the merchant ships the latter belong to particular merchants or trading companies such as the east india company the south sea company and others it is with such trading vessels that they run over all the known seas with merchandise and from one part of the globe to another   eugen how is a ship directed upon the sea   erast by her rudder which is a board fixed at the stern or tail of the ship under water upon hinges and moves to the right or to the left if moved to the left by the action of the water against it it will turn the head of the ship to the ight if moved to the right it turns the ship to the le this rudder is directed by a handle upon deck which the pilot moves at his pleasure   eugen and how do they know which way to go when ought of fight of land   erast out at sea they are directed by the compass of which i will give you some day a more particular description it is like the hand of a dial that always turns to the north this is placed before the person who steers directs the ship and as the ship moves this and moves and points out whether the vessel is going ts right course for as it is known in what part of the ompass the place lies to which the vessel is bound that is to say whether the port they are going to be orth south or so on the compass will always direct them to that port by directing the ship so as that the hand shall point north south or to that part of the globe to which it is bound near the coasts they are directed by sea marks trees or steeples planted or erected on high grounds for the purpose and at night by lighthouses that is towers with fires burning at the top of them   eugen who are at the expense of these erections   erast masters of ships  themselves in this country there is a corporation of gentlemen under the name of the trinity house of which there are thirtyone governors called elder brethren these gentlemen are authorized by government to collect from every master of a ship a certain toll for the purpose of erecting beacons and landmarks to point out shelves and sand lighthouses are supported also by a similar toll paid to particular people to support the necessary expenses of such lights   eugen when a ship is out of sight of land for many weeks is it possible to know how far they have got upon their voyage   erast yes they know this by the longitude and the latitude   eugen be pleased to explain them to me   erast the longitude of any place is its distance east or west from the port we sail and to find this out we calculate by the pace or rate that the ship goes at knowing how far distant the place is to which the ship is going seamen take notice at several periods through the day and night how fast the vessel sails as whether she goes six seven or eight miles an hour more or less this is found by throwing what is called the log line which is a line with a knot at certain distances wound off a reel into the water at the ships side by a minute glass and in proportion as the ship runs from the knots in this line each of which is a mile they by experience measure its pace which is  down every time the line is thrown and calculated  the end of the day but this is a very uncertain way  findidng it out they are often very much deceived  their reckoning the latitude which is the distance  one place from another north or south they can te very accurately as i will hereafter explain but the longitude is what seamen wish to discover and for thi purpose most nations have promised large rewards to the discoverer it may be known by a watch if on could be made to keep time regularly without the lea variation one harrison invented such a timekeeper and received from government a reward of twenty thousand pounds but this does not quite answer the purpose it having been found to vary   eugen i am anxious to know how a timekeeper will discover it   erast i will explain that to you at some future time when i give you an account of the earths motion as you will then better understand it and i will at that time describe the latitude we will therefore resume our subject i was telling you i think that each ship to be equipped for her voyage must have a sufficient number of men on board her to work her in her passage   eugen what are the officers on board a kings ship   erast the officers that rank as gentlemen are the captain the lieutenants and the midshipmen the chaplain the surgeon and the surgeons mate a young man must be a midshipman six years before he can be made a lieutenant and must undergo an examination before the admiralty as to his proficiency in his profession   eugen does six years service entitle a man toi a lieutenancy   erast no some that have not interest to be appointed lieutenants have continued midshipmen all their lives   eugen are there more than one lieutenant to a ship   erast according to the size of the ship a first and secondrate ship have six lieutenants each a third rate five lieutenants a fourth or fifth rate three each and every other vessel one   eugen what are the several ranks of navy officers and their pay   erast an admiral and commander in chief has ve pounds a day an admiral three pounds ten shillings  vice admiral two pounds ten shillings a rear admiral ne pound fifteen shillings captains according to the ize of the ships from one pound fifteen shillings per day ach to eight shillings master and commander eight hillings lieutenants some five some four shillings and idshipmen the pay only of a common man four or ive pounds a month the chaplain nineteen shillings a onth and four pence a month from each mans pay he surgeon five pounds a month and two pence a onth from each mans pay the other men are paid different salaries according to their offices  hese officers have some other perquisites besides a share f the prizes or ships they take from the enemy in time f war   eugen are there not some land forces always on oard ships of war   erast marines who have nothing to do with working the ship their duty is merely to defend it in war and attack the enemy when the ship is fighting there is generally a company on board each ship about orty in number under a captain and two lieutenants and there are seventy companies of marines in the whole   eugen are the officers of the navy as much esteemed as those of the army   erast equally so and they rank before the army that is to say a captain of a ship ranks with a lieutenant olonel in the army and a lieutenant of a man of war anks with a captain   eugen are there any officers in the marines higher han a captain   erast yes but not so many in number there re but three divisions or regiments of marines each of which has two or more majors from two to four lieuteant colonels one or two colonel commandants and a olonel there is also a lieutenant general and a geneal of marines   eugen is there any provision made for tho unfortunate seamen who are wounded in the service   erast yes besides a sum of money given to each in proportion to his wound called smartmoney there an two charitable institutions for this purpose the chest a chatham and greenwich hospital  the chest at chatham gives gratuities for wounds and small annual pensions to such as have been wounded in proportion to what they have suffered  greenwich hospital receives such seamen as by age wounds and other accidents are disabled from furthe service and provides for the widows and children  such as are slain in this hospital are generally tw thousand three hundred men one hundred and fifty boys and one hundred and forty women as nurses to the sick they are lodged clothed and fed for life and have each something allowed for pocketmoney they boys are taken in at eleven years of age and go our at sixteen either to sea or trade this hospital is supported by government and by sixpence a month pai out of every seamans wages   eugen a very comfortable provision truly be kind enough to give me an account of some of the trading companies you mentioned   erast if i explain one you will understand the whole i will then give you some idea of the east india company  the east india company is a number of people in partnership together for the purpose of trading to the east indies government has granted them a charter for that purpose on their paying the public four or five hundred thousand pounds a year so that you see how large their gains are the companys stock of money with which they carry on their trade consist of many millions and their profits are such that after paying all expenses and losses that occur in this joint trade they get about twelve per cent for the money they employ this partnership is open and free to every one that will join them there are every day persons to be found that will sell a share of this great concern a five hundred pounds share will entitle a person to a voice or vote in the concerns of the company which is principally conucted by thirteen directors chosen annually out of the artners or proprietors this company since their first establishment have driven the natives of bengal to the back part of the country and are now possessed f a great extent of territory and they keep an army or the defense of it the south sea company the ussian company the hudsons bay company and the frican are much upon the same plan though not so ich nor trading with so large a stock the value of each share or which is the same of each one hundred ounds stock rises and falls in proportion to the imaginary state of the company   eugen new you mention stock i could wish to have the nature of government stock explained   erast i must first tell you that persons who have money to spare can by lending it to those who want it have five pounds annually for the use of every hundred pounds but no more as five per cent is the legal interest allowed by law but as the security such persons generally give for the return of the principal sum lent is not considered so good as government security government when in credit can borrow money at less interest than five per cent when government has established a tax to pay the interest of the money they wish to borrow they call upon the public to lend them the money upon the faith and credit of the nation when this sum of money is advanced it is called stock and government every half year pays the interest of this stock to the persons possessed of it now suppose i lend government one hundred pounds and wish some time afterward to have it again under an idea that government will never be able to repay me the principal i cannot get this money back from the state but i offer my one hundred pounds stock to you you tell me the state may be a bankrupt for any thing that is known to the contrary and then it will not be worth one shilling however if i choose to sell it you will give me sixty pounds for it which i agree to take it is on this account that the stocks rise and fall every day according to the number of buyers or sellers in the stock market a piece of bad news will frighten people and occasion many sellers and few buyers of course  lower the value of stock and a piece of good news  on the contrary occasion many buyers and few selle of course raise the price of stock the stocks of  trading companies rise and fall in proportion wi government stock as the interest of money in  stock keeps pace with the interest in another the stock is called the public funds   eugen is the sinking fund a fund of the sam kind   erast no government always takes care  establishing new taxes to answer every contingent pence of the state and  generally contrive that the taxes and other revenues of the crown shall exceed the public expenditure or outgoings so as to leave a surp of gain every year this surplus or saving is trsured up for the purpose of paying off at some futu time a part of the money they have before borrowe and the money or stock so saved or treasured up  called the sinking fund the design of it being to sink  lessen the public debt   eugen and do they often pay off the debts the owe   erast they will now and then pay off a few milions by means of the money so saved but they wi never be able to pay off the whole for owing to wa and a variety of unforeseen expenses the national debt amounts now to upwards of two hundred an twenty millions of pounds so that government ha enough to do to find money to pay the interest of tha debt which interest at three per cent amounts annually to seven millions it is this enormous debt that ha injured the credit of the nation for people begin  think now that some time hence so far from paying o the principal they will not be able to pay the interest and it is under this idea that one hundred pounds stock will not sell for sixty pounds   eugen how long has this great debt been growing   erast not a hundred years   eugen what sir are the navy bills   erast when the commissioners of the navy pu chase any naval stores or employ any shipping to tranport provisions troops etc to distant parts they pay  these things in papermoney that is to say they e the seller an order upon the treasurer of the navy  so much money which order specifies that if the  is not paid in six months the holder of such bill shall ve four per cent interest on the sum due until it be id these bills are generally sold but at a disadvange one hundred pounds will scarce sell for more than ety pounds but let us return to the subject we were on   eugen i should like to take a voyage in one of ose great ships   erast nothing would be more interesting or ely the sea is like a chain that unites all parts  the globe together without navigation commerce uld not exist or at least could not flourish every e would find himself limited to the productions of his n country we should be deprived of that infinite sistance we receive from foreigners and could not eld them any besides the sea trains up a progious quantity of seamen which in time of war are r principal defense a great number are also emoyed in our fisheries which is a further nursery for amen   eugen a seafaring life must however be attended ith great dangers do not they dread storms and ipwreck   erast the sea has undoubtedly its dangers but  the land exempt from them are we not every day posed to a thousand accidents without the aid of an powerful hand who could protect us it is a consience in god that leads seamen to brave the tempest e shallows the sandbanks the currents the gulfs the irates or robbers on the sea and all the dangers of the eep god preserves mariners as he does other men and in fact we hear of very few perishing in proporon to the great numbers that follow a seafaring life ut one in a thousand if there was they would not e so ready as they are to embark the sea is as it ere their natural element they are not happy on ore besides the great sums of money they gain at sea is an object and they deserve all they get for risks they run   eugen a whirlpool they say is a danger thing what is the nature of it   erast it resembles a whirlwind in the air as  one is a circular current of air that sweeps things off  ground and takes them up aloft with it a whirpool  circular current in some parts of the sea that will dra vessel or any other thing within its reach to the centre middle of such whirling current and there suck it in sink it so as perhaps to rise no more it is suppo to be caused by a hole or cavern at the bottom of the  beneath it by which the waters are conveyed throu a subterraneous passage to some other part this duces the same effect as appears in the top of a fu when its contents are running into a bottle beneath  a hole in the center of the fluid and a strong sucti downwards   eugen i conceive many curious things are  with in long voyages   erast many the seas are immense and  whole globe may be traversed by means of navigati the most powerful european nations are the engli the dutch the french the spaniards and the porguese these have possessions beyond the seas isla have been discovered by subjects of european princ and some of them continue under their dominions  this day they have colonized them that is they ha peopled them by sending inhabitants there from th own countries the vast tract of america was peop chiefly by this country and was under english govement until within these few years   eugen were these places uninhabited that we thus colonized   erast no they were inhabited but by na savages these the people who landed there drove ba into the interior parts of the country and when the had built a town they defended it from the incursio of the natives   eugen but can this violent seizure of land reconciled with justice   erast certainly all territory was originally  quired by conquest this gave rise to the several states on the earth and when a number of people come d form a settlement upon a tract of land which the tives have no other claim on than an unrestrained erty of ranging it for food it such settlers put them the way of living more comfortably and gratify them th a thousand indulgences which otherwise they uld never have heard of instead of having reason to mplain they would in my opinion have cause to ess themselves at the fortunate event  it is to these distant parts then and to the different ctions of the world that europeans transport merchanse the growth of their respective countries bringing ck in exchange wealth of every kind gold silver ecious stones skins cottons sugar tea coffee cocoa chineal indigo pepper cinnamon tobacco and any other things which we have we trade to the ast of guinea for negroes that is for black slaves d carry them to the plantations abroad where they are ld and employed in agriculture and where inhumanity eats them little better than brutes in sailing to these imates we see remarkable things and the different proctions of the countries we become acquainted with eir manners their customs their religion and form of overnment in short we acquire an infinity of knowdge no less useful than curious but let us return to ommerce by land  merchants seldom go to sea themselves they transact  the business at home and ships convey their merchanise out and home was you in the counting house of capital merchant you would be astonished to see that without going out of that room they transact business in ll parts of the world some employ the ships of others others have ships of their own commerce in its utmost xtent is a prodigious thing you may judge of its xtent by the postage of letters which merchants annually ay there are houses in london that is merchants whose letters cost them upwards of six or seven hundred ounds a year and who will return more than seven or ight hundred thousand pounds annually i mean do business to that amount merchandise carried out of england to foreign parts are called exports  brought in imports   eugen exclusive then of the imports what  principal branch of our commerce   erast manufactures are the most considerable of english commerce and the manufacture of woo cloths the principal to encourage it government  obliged every person to be buried in a woolen  under the penalty of five pounds but besides branch of commerce we have a manufactory of established in spiralfields london of cottons vel muslins and a variety of other linens painted and  at manchester of ribbands at coventry of stocki at nottingham and other places of glass at newca and of hardware of all sorts at birmingham sheff and leeds whereas scotland and ireland are ch distinguished for linen as france and spain are nowned for their wines england is remarked for its  of which almost every county boasts of taking lead   eugen i presume the great towns generally away with the principal part of commerce   erast pretty much so where there is the advtage of a good sea port there is much business can on at least to foreign parts for example at lond bristol and liverpool but the manufactures are chi established in cheap countries and such as are wro by fire in places abounding with coals   eugen what is the difference between a whole and a retail business   erast a wholesale dealer is usually a merchan a manufacturer and sells only to those who sell ag of course deals out his goods in large quantities an contented with smaller gains whereas a retail tra parcels out his goods to the consumer and in such so quantities as he may have occasion for   eugen which is the most profitable then a wh sale business or a retail one   erast a wholesale business is generally the  lucrative for though wholesale dealers get less p upon every hundred pounds worth of goods they  yet as their returns in trade are very large and the dealings very considerable they are generally large ers upon the whole but they are at the same time osed to greater losses and such a trade requires a e sum of money to carry it on but a retail trader  has a great deal of business and many customers  in common a great deal of money and often re than many wholesale dealers because he has a ater profit and his money is quicker returned not ng obliged to give so long credit nor risk such large s we have seen retail traders get very great tunes but not generally in small towns for where re are but few inhabitants and many shopkeepers  trade is too much divided to admit of large gains   eugen it is owing to great losses i apprehend that  see so many bankrupts   erast every situation of life my good friend has disgraces you will be better acquainted with this as  advance in life the risk of loss i confess is a disaeable thing in trade when a man cannot pay his ts he is liable to be arrested and sent to prison and en once he is supposed to be deficient in this respect  his creditors fearful of losing their money apply to m for it this frequently occasions him to secret himf and shut up his shop such a man is then said to l or be a bankrupt for his creditors then seize upon  he has and divide his property among them in prortion to the several sums he owes sometimes the editors will get half their demands sometimes a fourth rt and sometimes not so much but if on examining his counts it appears that he has acted fairly they stomarily give him a general discharge which is called ning his certifitate and suffer him to begin trade again he can unmolested   eugen the accidental burning of a tradesmans atehouse or the loss of a ship load of goods at sea may in the fairest dealer unexpectedly   erast there are precautions against such unforesseen sses in london there are assuranceoffices that for  small annual premium will insure any mans property om loss by fire or the dangers of the sea these con of a number of opulent men whose fortunes are sponsible and adequate for any sums they insure tradesmen can have their houses and goods insured three or four shillings in the hundred pounds  is on paying three of four shillings a year for e hundred pounds they think proper to insure should fire accidentally destroy their property these offices  make good their losses as far as the hundred pou they have insured and they may insure to any among  in like manner may ships be insured during the voy they are about to make and that for about three or fo pounds in the hundred pounds the persons w do this are called underwriters nay these assuranc offices will go further they will insure any mans  for a sum of money in proportion to his age and  chance there is of his dying suppose a man was to gi one thousand pounds for one hundred pounds per ann for his life that his family may not lose the benefit  the money so laid out he can by paying to some of the offices twenty thirty or forty pounds a year more  less out of the one hundred pounds leave the thousand poun at his death to whom he pleases for die whe he will these offices will pay the money   eugen are they not often sufferers on this a count   erast no when it is considered how many persons property they insure the chance is much in the favor of course their losses are not so great as to ma them losers in the whole for they make their calcutions so that the premiums or rewards they receive for insuring are more than sufficient to make good every lo they are likely to sustain   eugen where a man can insure his property  this manner it is unpardonable in him to fail as it mu be owing to some neglect or inattention of his own   erast it is too frequently so men too often wi to get rich on a sudden they therefore undertake mo business and risk more money than their fortunes will enable them to do and to do this they run in debt for a variety of articles which perhaps afterward they cannot sell sometimes they will pay too little attention to their accounts and from an ignorance of their situation will spend every year more than they ca afford some men again will break fraudulently that will take up goods upon credit abuse the confidence  men put in them and spend the money such goods  for in extravagant living to the injury and often the  of those who trust them   eugen was i a tradesman i could easily find a hod not to lose any thing by bankrupts   erast if you would teach that method to others  would do them a great service what method ld you take   eugen i would trade only for ready money then ould lose nothing   erast was every one to do so he could not lose  that is impracticable credit is the very soul of de which could not subsist without it there is no alers fortune so large but that he carries on more de than he can immediately pay for of course he obliged to have credit many a man deals largely on credit without any real fortune of his own besides often happens that a man would not know what to y for goods when he buys the seller may not be able mediately to ascertain their value and the buyer may  have had an opportunity to inspect the quality of the ods bought or they may be purchased at a consideble distance from the buyer perhaps in the country at a seaport in which cases the money is afterward be remitted or conveyed to the seller do you know e nature of papermoney   eugen indeed i do not   erast you know the nature of a bank note which a written promise of the governors of the bank of gland to pay a certain sum there specified when ed for this was contrived for the convenience of de it not being troublesome to carry and can be nveyed by the post in a letter for the same purpose en in business instead of paying money for goods will quently give promissory notes of hand to pay the oney in one two three or four months more or less in rds to this effect three months after date i proise to pay to mr  or his order the sum of  lue received these notes are negotiable that is ll pass current from one to another the whole three onths they have to run when the possessor of the bill when payable carries it to the house of the person  first gave the note for payment   eugen and suppose he will not pay it   erast he then loses his credit and the hold of the note obliges him to pay it by law with all  expenses attending the recovery   eugen and what is a bill of exchange   erast this is contrivance to pay money in a distant part here is a merchant in london  example that trades with a merchant at amsterd suppose a wants to pay one hundred pounds to b friend in amsterdam a applies to this merchant london pays the hundred pounds to him and begs  to remit it to amsterdam he accordingly gives a a of exchange or draft upon his correspondent there words to this effect at sight pay to a or his ord one hundred pounds and place it to the account yours etc at then puts his name upon the back of  bill which is called indorsing it and sends it to  friends b by the post this indorsement intimates to  merchant a amsterdam when brought to him for pment that a has authorized it and the money is immdiately paid by this means too the merchant at asterdam conveys one hundred pounds to the merchant london so that it is a convenience on all sides t is called a foreign bill of exchange when such bills  between traders in the same country they are call inland bills       eugen from your account of trade it  busy pleasant life and  grow rich    erast it is perhaps the readiest road to acqui competency and without being obliged to any  say what you will of trade it must be honorable at is pleasant to owe our bread to no one but oneself could mention twenty examples of very rapid form made in trade from very small beginnings   eugen what is the best kind of commerce to deal in   erast that depends upon opinion and talents  as i to choose a trade it should be where the articles e and fall considerably in price   eugen and for what reason   erast because a clever sensible man who knows  profession may make his fortune suddenly in such a de for example i would buy but small quantity of h an article when it was dear because if it fell in its ce i should then lose but little but when it was cap i would lay out all the money i could and keep ill it was dearer and by felling it then i might per get treble the sum i paid for it especially if the rchandise i bought would keep this is what trades call speculation buying on foresight sometimes a son has been injured by this scheming for no one  answer for events but not very often  but it is time to think of returning home   eugen we are just got to the banks of the river that a quantity of boats what a bustle on the quay me loading and others unloading from whence ne these sawn planks   erast they are fir planks or deal and come from lland the dutch bring them from denmark and er northern countries probably some of these larger els are laden with wool from spain further are ves laden with cod from newfoundland herrings from etland oranges and lemons from spain sugar and rum m jamaica silk from turkey rice from carolina s from canada brandy from flanders claret and gundy from france and portwine from portugal  is my dear eugenius the train and chain of mmerce one may say it is an immense and perpetual eam which flows from city to city from kingdom to kingdom and from one end of the world to the other u see from its giving employment and maintenance to usands how great an object it is to a kingdom and ides this there is not an article that does not pay some siderable duty or tribute to the state it is an exten commerce joined to good husbandry that has dered england so numerous so rich and so flourish   discourse vi on the objects of nature eugen it is now three weeks sir since we pa visit to our friends in the country a from that time we have not been a day out of the city i long to be there again this fine weather is a tation winter will soon shut us up within our walls   erast the weather these fifteen days past  been too cool for a country excursion but as it  seems fine we will profit by it we will go an see  the corn looks after so much rain for when it is cut good deal of rain will make it shoot   eugen and when the wheat shoots is it not so goo   erast no it loses in its weight of course it d not produce so great a quantity of flour besides  flour from such wheat is not of so good a quality it the same with oats and other grain with which we f cattle if it is injured by too much wet it is not nourishing nor will it keep so long as if got in in a  season   eugen this is one reason then that we dr continual rains and stormy tempestuous weather it does a great deal of damage but whence arise th effects why does god permit it what is the ca of the variation of the seasons what is the use of  stars above us you see sir i am not ashamed of  ignorance there are a thousand things in nature  i do not comprehend if you remember you once pmised to explain them to me shall i request you to it now   erast with pleasure i admire your curios it is certainly pleasing to inquire into the works of ture you have opened to me a wonderful scen things and to the best of my abilities i will give an insight into them  to make you acquainted with natural history  must proceed with a degree of order let us first back to the origin of the world i do not mean the history of the creation that you have a knowledge of already all that is necessary to remember now is that moses the author of that history was not deceived having received his intelligence from god himself with whom he conversed face to face all that god thought proper to communicate to moses and the prophets by inspiration we call revelation his holy spirit enlightened their minds and taught them such things as they wished to know and to teach to others so that men who would speak of the origin of the world without an attention to revelation let them be as wise as they may can only set forth false systems which destroy one another and are little else than dreams of the imagination whereas by the recital of moses so simple and at the same time so sublime the formation of the universe unfolds itself to us in a very satisfactory manner we will contemplate then to day the works of the lord the sole author and preserver of nature and we will first turn our thoughts to the heavens which declare his power and his glory what other hand what other force than his could support in the infinite expanse above those great globes which we fee what other wisdom could regulate their course and preserve that regularity with which they have rolled in that immense space for six thousand years   eugen it is a spectacle truly worthy of the greatness of god of all the havenly bodies the sun seems the finest and the most striking   erast it does it is on this account that many idolatrous nations dazzled with the brilliancy of its ays and amazed at the influence of its heat on the productions of nature take it for a god and adore it there was a famous temple at heliopolis dedicated to the worship of the sun many who have not received the benefit of revelation to whom the gospel is unknown remain at this day in that deplorable ignorance   eugen shall i trouble you sir to explain the nature of the sun moon and stars i am ashamed to know o little concerning them   erast it would be useless to you to give you an account of the different systems which celebrated  have invented for the structure of the heavens i will only inform you of that which is now universally admitted it is the system of copernicus a native of thorn in prussia improved by sir isaac newton of england  except the sun and moon we in general call all those celestial globes stars which we see scattered up and down in the immensity of the heavens many of them are luminous bodies that is to say give light of themselves but there are some that are not luminous but opake and give light only by reflection from the sun that is to say the sun shines upon them and they throw back his light in the same manner as we see the windows of a house frequently do toward the evening when the sun is setting of this latter kind is the moon and the planets   eugen i wish sir you would begin with the sun   erast i ought indeed the sun being apparently a a torch to the universe or the principle of all light would you believe it eugenius that there are a prodgious quantity of suns   eugen how a quantity and do we see more tha one now   erast no but in the night we discern stars in numerable and philosophers assert that they are a suns probably larger than the one that gives us light i the day if so at what an enormous distance from the earth must these suns be placed for the farther off a object is the smaller it appears and if we look at the stars through a telescope which brings them some milions of miles nearer to the eye they do not app larger let us suppose a bullet shot from a cannon  wards the nearest star and to go at the rate of   0 mi an hour it would be   00000 years in going the the stars are fixed that is they occupy constantly  same space in the firmament they have no moti but a rotatory one like a wheel round its axle we lieve them from their twinkling to be of the same ture with the sun   eugen if the stars are fixed what are those wh we observe occasionally to shoot and fall   erast this is one of those optic illusions that deeive our eyes the falling star as you call it is no other than a meteor resembling a star and at no very great distance from us it is formed from certain exhalations that rise in the air suddenly take fire and soon isappear and is of a similar kind with what is called n ignus fatuus or a will of the wisp   eugen i have heard frequently of that but never ighly understood it   erast that also is a meteor formed of a like matter and is chiefly seen at night in marshy places the country people call it jack in the lanthorn and suppose it misleads the traveller frequently into those bogs over which it hovers   eugen a childish tale i suppose there is another minous appearance i have noticed i believe it is alled the northern lights   erast yes the aurora borealis or northern dawn  an extraordinary meteor a luminous appearance ewing itself in the nightime in the northern part of the eavens it appears commonly in the form of an arch iefly in spring and autumn after a dry year but geerally transparent so as to see through it many have tempted to account for it but in vain it is however lowed to be a kind of electric fire issuing from the air  are those faint streams of light that frequently flash  the heavens at night and which are called lights in e air   eugen of what nature sir is the sun   erast an immense ocean of fluid fire which never nsumes we suppose the sun to be a globe because his round and to be fire because it gives light and at as fire does we suppose it fluid like water because spots are observed on it that change their situation d shape these spots are thought to be bodies diffent from the nature of the sun floating in its subce and thrown upon its surface like the scum upon ing oil with respect to the size of this globe of  it is according to the calculation of philosophers but a million of times as large as that of the earth  conceive now an immense round space of the heas almost infinite in the center of which the creator has placed the sun there it is fixed except that it rolls continually like a wheel round its axis with an inconceivable swiftness but which on account of its enormous size it is twentyfive days and a half in doing and notwithstanding this as its circumference is     000 miles it must turn at the rate of   0   miles a day to perform its revolution in that time to give you an idea of the distance of the sun from us which according to allowed calculations is  0000000 of miles off were we to travel to the sun and at the rate of  00 miles a day we should be  0 0 years in going  in this immense space where the sun is fixed there are certain planets that at different distances revolve or roll in circles round him   eugen what are these planets   erast there are six of the first order their name are mercury venus the earth mars jupiter and saturn they all move round the sun one way from west to east mercury makes its revolution round the sun in about three months venus in seven the earth in twelve which is one year mars in two years jupiter in twelve and saturn in thirty years these planets are opake sold globes like the earth and giv light as i told you by reflection from the sun they may be known from the stars by their never twinkling  these planets have also a rotatory motion round the own axes as a wheel turns round its axle which revolution they perform in certain stated times for example the earth while it employs a year in making its revolution round the sun turns round its own axis ever twentyfour hours and that from west to east i sha not mention the times the five other planets take in peforming their revolutions as i would not burden you memory with unnecessary things   eugen are there no more than these six planets   erast there are ten others of a second orde which are called satellites these attend upon the respective planets the earth has one called the moon jupiter has four and saturn five that is to say jupiter has four moon revolving round it and saturn five ding the time they themselves revolve round the sun   eugen pray sir what is a comet   erast a comet is a kind of planet vulgarly called a lazing star from its having a fiery tail it is distinuished by a long train or trail of light in a direction pposite to the sun we are not certain how many there re we know only that they describe a prodigious ngthened circuit round the sun which makes them appear at certain stated times once in a number of years eventy or eighty comets when viewed through a lescope have a most awful appearance being large obular bodies with long blazing tails and something ke fiery darts or streams of burning rays about the obe itself various have been the conjectures of what nature they are but none to any purpose   eugen i think you said sir that the planets are not minous bodies and of course do not give light from themselves like the sun   erast i did they are dark opake and more or ss solid bodies like the globe of the earth that e of them which the sun shines on reflects a light ck which we see when the sun is not visible so as to lipse their light were we in one of the planets the eth would appear to us then as the planets do to us w that is like a star   eugen permit me sir to say that this system apars very singular you advance that the sun is a fixed dy except its turning round its own axis and that the rth and other planets make a periodical revolution und it from west to east now sir if we believe our n eyes we are taught the contrary for the sun seems  move and the earth to stand still does not the  rise every day in the east and set in the west   erast in appearance it does but not so in reality e earth as i observed to you besides its annual revotion round the sun turns like a wheel round its own s every twentyfour hours and by this wonderful ntrivance every inhabitant on the earth is by rotation esented to the sun and enjoys the benefit of its salutary nence when this motion brings any part of the th within view of the sun it is called day but on t part where the sun does not shine it is called night us in every twentyfour hours is day and night alnately occasioned all over the world this motion of the earth being from west to east causes an apparent motion of the sun the contrary way and other heavenly bodies that is from east to west for the fixed stars appear to us to rise and set as does the sun   eugen and how is this accounted for   erast because we are not sensible of our own motion you must have taken notice that when we were in a boat the shore we looked at and every thing upon that shore seemed to move the contrary way to that we were going for such is the wise direction of providence that partaking of the motion of the earth in common with the earth we are not sensible of its moving and of course are led to suppose that the objects move on which we look the earth whirls round at the rate of  00 miles an hour and were we to be sensible of its motion the consequences would be very bad indeed every thing upon it partakes of the common motion of the globe itself and is not any way affected by that motion in the same manner as no alteration takes place in any thing on board a ship let the ship move as fast as it will a bottle of water for example hung up or board a vessel to empty itself drop by drop into another bottle placed under it with a narrow neck the drops will all fall directly into the bottle though the ship shall have run many inches whilst the drop was in the air   eugen how sir are the seasons accounted for   erast as the hours and days are accounted for by the motion of the earth round its axis so are the months and seasons by its revolution round the sun it makes its great circuit once in twelve months a as the sun is not immediately in the center of that great circle which the earth describes it must happen that in its course it is at one time of the year nearer the sun than at another when it is farthest from the s it is our summer when nearest winter and when between the two extremes spring and autumn   eugen how is that possible the nearer the earth is to the sun one would suppose the more it must feel its heat now we feel less of its heat in winter than in summer   erast this arises from the position the earth  with respect to the sun when the sun is farthest from the earth as in summer it is over our heads and its rays fall down perpendicularly upon us and in that direction a great many more rays fall on any parricular spot than when they fall on us in an oblique direction or come upon us sideways as they do in winter the sun being then apparently lower in the heavens besides in summer then sun though further off is more hours with us every day than in winter of course the longer it shines on us though perhaps not so hot the more it warms the earth than a greater heat would o in winter in fewer hours  therefore as the earth is round it is plain to see from its daily and annual motions that the season and the days and nights must vary on the different parts of the globe it is summer in one part when it is winter n another and the days increase and decrease according to the time that the sun is in view in some parts of the globe there is only one night and one day throughout the year that is the sun is seen for six months in the year and is not seen for the other six in these places the sun never rises very high but yet sets ot during the whole six months but seems to go round and round us during the other six months it never ises the greenlanders are in this situation who generally quit the island when the sun leaves it  talking of the revolutions of the earth round the sun leads me to say something to you of the late alteration of our style have you a proper knowledge of it   eugen i must confess my ignorance   erast the i will explain it to you though generally speaking we say that the earth takes a year to ake her circuit round the sun yet the exact time she akes is     days   hours wanting some minutes now s our year is divided into     days in four years we should lose nearly a day if we did not add it occasionally to the calendar to remedy this every fourth ear in the shortest month february we add a day aking it to consist of twentynine days instead of twentyeight and this fourth year is called leapyear ut by this occasional addition of a day we gain fortyfour minutes every year which in     years amount to one day and in a greater number of years we had gained eleven days government therefore in order to retrench the time so gained to prevent any change of seasons by such acquisition and to regulate our year by that of other countries who had before take the same step thought it necessary to throw out the eleven days from the calendar in september      and to call the next day after the second the fourteenth some years hence it will be necessary to take some such step again   eugen if you remember you promised when you had explained the earths motion to give me an account of the timekeeper for ascertaining the longitude   erast i did and i cannot do it at a better time than now  the earths surface is divided into   0 equal parts by imaginary lines drawn from north to south which are called degrees of longitude the earths daily revolution round its axis eastward as i told you is performed in twentyfour hours consequently in that time the places under each of those imaginary lines or degrees become in turn opposite to the sun that is the sun is as it were over the heads of persons dwelling or being in those places and it is then noon or twelve oclock at such places now from the time any one o those lines passes the sun till the next line passes it mu be just four minutes for twentyfour hours which i    0 minutes divided by   0 will give four minutes so that for every degree of longitude we sail to the east we as it were meet the sun and noon will be four minutes sooner than it would have been had we continues where we were and on the contrary if we sail westward we as it were retire from the sun and noon will b four minutes later now if when it is exactly noon  the place we sail from which may be known by the sun we set the timekeeper at twelve oclock and sa eastward if this timekeeper does not vary it will always tell us the hour it is at the place we sailed from if upon examination some time afterward we find it t be exactly noon or twelve oclock when the timekeeper points to ten in the morning it is evident that we a two hours eastward of the place we sailed from whi s equal to   00 miles reckoning sixty miles to a degree for two hours is thirty times four minutes and each four minutes being a degree two hours is exactly thirty degrees or   00 miles   eugen you have explained it very clearly now sir for the latitude   erast the latitude is the distance of any one place from the equator or a supposed line drawn round the globe of the earth in the middle between the two poles or ends that is the distance from north to south to have a proper idea of this you must consider the earth as round or globular and that there is a fixed star in the north part of the heavens called the pole star when we are at the equator or middle of the earth this pole star appears level with the ground we stand on but as we travel toward it that is to the north this star is observed to rise higher in the heavens but were we to turn our backs upon it and travel to the southward that is from it we should soon lose sight of it as the roundness or swell of the earth would hide it from our view in this case we should see a variety of stars that in our present northern hemisphere or situation we can never see and the more we continued our journey southwards the more new stars would arise n view but on our return toward the north we should lose them again now as when placed in the equator or the middle of the earth the pole star appears on a level with the ground we stand on so as we travel northward or toward it it appears to rise higher in the heavens and by measuring its height which is done by an instrument made for that purpose called a uadrant we can tell exactly how far we have traveled northward for every degree the pole star is risen in the heavens we have traveled sixty miles from the equator so that when we arrive in england and measure the height of this star and find it fiftyone degrees and a half which is the height of the pole star with us we know that we are about   00 miles distant from the middle of the earth  i will endeavor to explain this better by comparison suppose the weathercock on a churchsteeple to be seen st above the top of a hill as we rise the hill part of the steeple will appear and the weathercock will apparently rise higher in like manner the higher we get and the more we get over the hill the higher will the weathercock appear as the body of the church will he then seen under it let the weathercock be now the north or pole star and the hill the swell or rotundity of the earth as the further we advance upon the hill and travel toward the weathercock the higher it seems to be so the further we travel toward the star and rise over the rotundity of the earth the higher will the pole star appear in the heavens and of course the height of the star will measure the length of way we have traveled   eugen the comparison is a very just one and answers the purpose you designed by it you said sir that the moon was a secondary planet to the earth and not only revolved round it but continued so revolving during the earths whole revolution round the sun   erast i did   eugen be kind enough to explain to me the appearances of the moon what are those spots we observe in it   erast the moon is an opake solid body like the earth and all the other planets it is like them also a globe about fifty times smaller than the earth from which it is distant about   0000 miles being an opake body it gives no light of itself but what it reflects back whils the sun shines upon it when in her course round the earth she happens to be between the earth and the sun as at new moon the side on which the sun shine is turned from the earth and we do not see it when it is in the opposite part of the heavens and we a between the moon and the sun as at full moon the sun shines full upon that side that is turned toward u and we see its full face when it is in the midway between both we see only half the globe of the moo enlightened this is in its first and third quarters wh it appears horned and what we call gibbous or humpbacked according to the quantity of the enlightened pa we can perceive observe the horns of the moon always turned from the sun it is thus we account for s different appearances throughout the month  as to the spots we see so distinctly upon its face or sk when viewed through a telescope they seem to e the effects of water and hills upon the surface of its obe hence we presume it is a solid body like the earth d may possibly be inhabited but it appearing to ve no atmosphere the people there if any do not eathe indeed all the planets for any thing that we ay know may be inhabited and each star may be a sun e center of a system of worlds this opinion does not  all interfere with the almighty power of the creator o may according to his pleasure create as many orlds as he forms grains of sand   eugen it is a pity that no one has taken a joury to the moon to know what is doing there   erast we hope one day to be satisfied in that rticular a very curious person examining the moon rough the great telescope at the observatory at paris ought he saw in it an animal that moved struck with e sight and not doubting of the fact he called others he witness of it they ran and examined and saw as hey supposed an animal that seemed to walk upon the ce of the moon but it was very far distant from that   eugen what was it then   erast the telescope was twenty feet long and e person had conveyed a mouse into it purposely lay the fool with this observer   eugen it was a pleasant trick but what are the ses of the eclipses you see sir that if i know nong more i know at least how to ask question   erast it is a proof of your judgment and i am ased with it as the moon revolves round the earth  the earth with its revolving moon round the sun ust happen at times that the moon will be between  earth and the sun in which case it will intercept  light of the sun from some part of the earth as if  put your hand between your eye and a candle it  obscure the candle either in whole or in part where  light is so intercepted the sun will be eclipsed and e or less according to the quantity of light intered so that to a spectator on the earth the sun will seem to be darkened by the moon passing before it this must always happen at new moon as we find eclipses of the sun do when the light side of the moon i turned from us should it happen by the same me that the earth comes between the moon and the sun and directly opposite to each other the earth being a solid substance casting and shadow behind it and the moon passing through that shadow will be eclipsed more or less as she passes more or less through the shade thi most always happen at full moon eclipses of the su are seen only in particular places where the suns ligh it intercepted from them but eclipses of the moon must be universal and are seen every where it being obscured by the earths shadow   eugen we are apt to think a good deal of thos things and that we are under the influence of the star but for my part i do not know whether my planet  good or bad   erast you make me smile with your planet exclusive of the effects of heat from the suns rays which sometimes have very sensible influence upon nature and that influence which we attribute to the moon upon the tides be assured there is no other the stars ta no part in any thing that concerns us the influence of the planets is an old and vulgar error the anc romans considered all the fingular phenomena whi they remarked in the heavens as so many prodigi the egyptians used to beat kettles and thus made great noise to frighten away the dragon which t said attacked the moon when they saw it eclipses the truth of astronomical knowledge has convinced of the vanity of judicial astrology and has cured us its chimaeras   eugen you are now clearing up things to which i had no comprehension of but how was knowledge acquired and what proofs are there of   erast from the earliest ages men have attac themselves to the study of the stars they observed phenomena of nature and remarked the regular re of seasons the constant and wonderful order of heavenly bodies philosophy and astronomy have gone a great wayinto this enquiry in short by assistance of glasses that bring objects nearer to the iew i mean telescopes which by chance were discovered   eugen i beg pardon for interrupting you but ow was this discovery made   erast very remarkably the children of a ectacle maker at middleburg in zealand having put two glasses into a tube one before the other by way of musement and looking through them at the cock upon clock it appeared so large and brought it so near to the ye that they ran and told their father of it who was urprised at the effect he presently made the first telescope we had which since had been so much improved as to enable us by their help to demonstrate eometrically what passes at very great distances the alculations of good astronomers are such that they now how to predict a number of years before both the hour and minute of the return of each season the moent the greatness and duration of eclipses and point t those which are visible to us and to others but as  the predictions of rain or fine weather which we eet with in almanacks they are fit only to amuse fools he alteration of the weather depends more or less on the weight of the air and the direction of the winds f course who can fortel their variations   eugen i could wish to have some account of the r and the winds   erast the air consists of an infinite number of rticles or small bodies of water and other matter exled from the earth and sea by the heat of the sun ese rise some miles above the earth and being conused or pressed together form clouds which beming too heavy by collecting for the air below to pport them fall in rain or in cold weather in snow or il which is nothing more than rain frozen into flakes of ice in the upper region of the air   eugen what are fogs and dew   erast dew is the vapor or watery particles raised  the sun from the earth but in the mornings and mings at sunrise and sunset the sun yields not suffint heat to carry it up into the air of course it is by e cold condensed or thickened and falls upon the earth agains this frozen in the winter gives the white  oarfrost  a fog is also the vapor rising from the earth and owing to the cold morning particularly in spring and autumn is condensed and of course becomes too heavy to rise in the air it hovers therefore upon the surface of the ground and sometimes so low that you may see over it  a mist is the same vapor but carried rather higher it is in fact a thin cloud that falls before it b sufficiently condensed but not so low as to touch the surface of the ground of course by stooping down  may see under it this vapor according to its degree  condensation will sometimes appear only as a mist an at others in drizling rain so that you see the fog rises b the mist falls i have seenin an evening and a morning in hot weather the vapors rise from the top of a hig hill in one particular spot like smoke from a chimney and in such quantities as to be too heavy to be carried u into the air of course have fallen down again presentl and in a quarter of an hour have covered the who valley with mist   eugen how high will these vapors rise   erast the atmosphere surrounds the earth an rises above it to the distance of about fortysix  fortyseven miles but the clouds are not generall above two or three miles high the tops of the hills a frequently above the clouds the higher we ri in that atmosphere the thinner we find the air a it is supposed that at the height of six or seven miles from the surface of the earth it would be too the to support life for it is by breathing air of a certa weight that we live in wet weather the air is conderably lighter than in fine weather   eugen how is that sir do not we call da weather heavy weather and do not we feel  spirits oppressed at such times whereas in fine weather we are light and active   erast we do but this is owing to our reason from effects a certain weight of air is necessary keep us in health was i to mention the weight of which the body of a man supports it would be al incredible it is not less than about      0 pounds nearly fourteen tons a weight that would crush him providence had not wisely provided against it but he is made air of so subtle a nature as to pervade all bstances let them be ever so compact of course roughout the frame of man there is a quantity of ternal air that acts as an equipoise to the external essure so that we are not incommoded by it if then e weight of the air be reduced to thirteen tons we find rselves disordered for if fourteen tons weight of air  necessary to constringe and brace the fibers and nerves  the body a loss of one ton must of course relax  and a heaviness of spirits ensue it is owing to this at we call a light air heavy and a heavy air light is this weight of air that foretells the weather in the rometer or weatherglass the air being extracted between the surface of quicksilver and the top of the ss as the weight of the atmosphere presses upon the reservoir of quicksilver in the basin at bottom it es in the tube of course the heavier the air the gher it rises and the lighter the air the lower it sinks hen therefore we observe the quicksilver to sink we pect rain as the air becoming lighter will not have fficient strength to buoy up the clouds   eugen now you mention the weight of the air  me if you please what these airballoons are that ve made so much noise of late   erast it is a known principle in natural philosophy t in any fluid the lighter body will rise to the top in the sea a lighter body as wood and cork will rise to e surface so in the air bodies lighter than the air will e in it for example smoke feathers etc now it  lately been discovered that a light hollow globe ed with gas which is an ebullition or air extrited from certain substances as vitriol steelfilings e putrefaction of animal bodies or other things ich there is a means of doing acids poured upon elfilings will procure this gas which is lighter than  air and will naturally raise the globe till it meet with art of the atmosphere as light and thin as itself when ill rise no higher ingenious men from this discoy may hereafter find a method of directing it in the air and by this means a way of conveying things from one place to another   eugen i have heard sir that the rainbow is oing to a reflection of the light from the drops of rain falling from the clouds is it so   erast it is and it arises from a beautiful disposition of colors which the rain takes on when the sun shines upon the falling cloud a disposition odained by the alimighty as a token of his promise t noah that he would never again drown the world the full moon shining on the rain will also occasion a rainbow but a fainter one   eugen you mentioned the subtilty of the air and its pervading all substances   erast i did it is the primum mobile or principal agent of all nature it acts upon vegetables as well  animals nothing can live without it by means  the lungs we inspire and expire alternately that is  say we draw in the air and throw it out again by tur the air has a great influence upon health when tiated by accidental causes it occasions epidemic sickness both to man and beast it pervades the wate and the very bowels of the earth it is this in conjution with fire that causes earthquakes the earth  closes in its bowels a great deal of inflammable matte which very easily takes fire and will then expand t air pent up in subterraneous caverns and convul the earth sometimes it will burst its enclosures ma great mists in the earth swallow up every thing upon the surface and belch out its flames in great abundan hence arise the vulcanos or burning mountain  many parts of the world which are a kind of tunn or chimnies where this subterraneous fire has ve vesuvius has burnt for more than a thousand years  from this account of the nature of air you  form a good idea of the wind which is merely a crent of air more or less violent according to the imtuosity with which it moves for the air fluctuates  the waves of the sea and is as capable of being agita to the utmost degree  the winds take different names from the points fr whence they blow viz north east south and west seamen who conduct their ships from place to place the wind find it necessary to know the least varians of course they divide these four names into rtytwo but such an accurate knowledge is not nesary for you it is enough to know the effects of  four winds a north wind in winter is very sharp  in summer it moderates and refreshes both plants  animals and a south wind in winter temperates  cold these are the winds that bring and chase ay the rain it is the property of wind to dry the d it is of use to turn windmills where there is not convenience to erect watermills but one of the at benefits which the wind affords is that of assist the vegetation of plants its action serves to raise  sap and keep it in motion   eugen but i have known dreadful effects from  wind i have seen it tear up trees by the roots and rturn buildings by its rage   erast i believe it the violence of the winds o be dreaded when they cross and clash with each er when an east wind and west wind rages and ets each other with fury they excite whirlwinds tems and hurricanes which sweep away all before them whirlwind is a circling wind that frequently in the dy deserts of arabia will carry up the dust a conerable height in the air and smother a traveller that pens to be in it hurricanes are such a scourge to igation that mariners dread them exceedingly ere was such a furious hurricane at guardaloupe in   that lifted out of the waters a vessel of eighty s burden then at anchor in the port and by one t carried her more than  000 paces upon the land  are my friend the different effects of air and wind th respect to the velocity of wind it goes in a great m at the rate of fifty or sixty miles an hour a mon brisk wind flies about fifteen miles an hour  some winds move not one mile an hour now  are on the subject of air there is a phenomena  two that i would make you acquainted with   eugen i am all attention   erast one is sound the other is the echo sound e effect of air struck or pressed on by some compulsive cause till it reaches our ear air undula like water and as when we strike the water in any o place it communicates its motion to the water nexts  and so on till the force of such stroke is felt at a considerable distance so is it in air if we give moti to the air by our voice that motion will mo the adjoining air and will extend the communication in proportion to the agitation we first give it t louder the noise the further the sound is thus communicated in a word the air is a fluid so subtle and decate and its motion is so quick that the sound of great clock will be carried   00 feet in a second of time   eugen now sir for the echo   erast an echo is accounted for on the sa principles an undulation is given to the air by  concussion of the voice this undulation reaches so wall some house or some wood meets there with resistance and is reflected or reverberated back to  ear so that we shall hear the same words some secon after we have spoken them if there are two or three or more resisting objects in the way the will e send back the sound in their turn and we shall hear  same word repeated two three or more times   eugen i have been told that light is a body  that it passes a great deal quicker than sound   erast light is another phenomenon in natural not less wonderful than air it is a fluid that ex without ceasing we admit that light is part of  substance of the sun from whence it flows and is subtle as to penetrate every where throughout the  its velocity or quickness of passing is so great that will run neat twelve millions of miles in one min it is by the combined effects of the air and light t we are indebted for the dawn and the twilight   eugen pray sir explain it to me   erast if it were not for the atmosphere as  as the sun sets we should lose the benefit of his li and be in instant darkness but though the sun by ting is hid from our view it still continues to  light to the upper part of the atmosphere which flects it down upon us and gives the twilight so break of day was it not for the air as soon as the rises we should have instant day and the sudden glare uld hurt our sight but the almighty has provided ainst it it illuminates the atmosphere above somee before it rises forms what we call the dawn d introduces the day to us gradually   eugen i think sir in speaking of the winds you d nothing of the monsoons  what are they   erast there is something wonderful in the phenomena of the monsoons or trade winds they always w from one and the same quarter of the globe in  ethiopic atlantic and pacific oceans to thirty degrees of the equinoctial line they are found to blow tinually toward the west but in the bay of bengal abian chinese and indian seas they blow in the mer to the northeast and in the winter to the southt so that if the seamen who sail in those parts obe the seasons they never fail of a fair wind to ry them out and bring them back they waft the el generally at the rate of about nine miles an hour   eugen and to what is this owing   erast to the powerful influence of the sun in e warm climates for when the air is very much ed it will rise to the upper part of the atmosphere  the adjacent air will rush in to supply its place  therefore there will be a stream or current of air  all parts toward the place where the heat is  it being the property of heat to rarefy or expel the  the same phenomenon will take place in a room  a fire in it for as the fire expels the air round it  adjacent air will rush in so that there is a constant ght between the window if open and the fire and reen the doors and the fire of course to fit in such ents or draughts of air is not only unpleasant but gerous to the health   eugen of all the four elements fire i apprehend ost to be dreaded i have a very imperfect notion re and shall be happy to be better imformed   erast fire my dear eugenius is like water a  good servant but a very bad master   eugen you mean that it is very useful to man  kept within bounds but very destructive when ed to rage or get head   erast i do with respect to its nature it is inexplicable riddle we know only that fire is a pdigious elastic fluid which gives heat and light t burning fluid so subtle and to which we give the n of electric matter is spread throughout the atmosphere and exists invisibly more or less in all body as long as it is shut up it is peaceable and as it we captive it requires only a certain degree of motion make us perceive it two bodies striking against rubbed hard upon each other is sufficient to let it lo it then sparkles gives light and will communicate wh it can its action lasts till the object it attacks and f it is reduced to ashes take notice how the air agit and increases fire if it wants air it will smother disappear the more the air is condensed that  say the thicker and heavier it is the more it presses  fire and increases its heat this is the reason that is more lively in winter because the air that surro it is at that time more condensed for the con reason the air being more ratified that is to say lig in summer fire then has less force you must have served that the sun shining upon the fire will put it and for the reason i mentioned   eugen you must allow however that it is i summertime and in hot weather that fire make greatest ravages for example the thunder w think you of that dreadful phenomenon   erast the real opinion of the best natural osophers is that lightning is no other than that tric matter of which i have told you a kind of fluid infinitely subtle and penetrating this fire communicate and join itself with almost every th and become more active and more violent it rises the earth into the upper regions of the air and  meeting with a great quantity of imflammable extions which are a kind of food to electric fire s lightning and thunder this is so true that homates where the air is full of bitumen sulphur petre and other like substances are more subject lightning and thunder than other parts it thu frequently in italy and almost all the year in jam but much more seldom in cold countries and ere is great deal of rain lightning is no more an sparks from electrified clouds clouds driven by ontrary winds collect and beat one against another is creates an infinity of sparks which are the foreruners of thunder if the sparks meet with a good deal f inflammable matter collected it augments the action f the electric fire so as to break in thunder and thunderbolts the sudden firing of this matter and the xpansion and terrible explosion of these globes of fire riking the air with great violence produces a dreadful ife which is heard a great way off though we ow not the nature of this fire if we judge of it by s effects the powers of lightning when accompanied ith thunder is great and wonderful we have known e blade of a sword to be melted in the scabbard and e scabbard not hurt  a foot burnt in the shoe and the oe not injured liquor disappear in a corked bottle d the bottle not broke when thunder is heard d no lightning is seen it is that the clouds which casion the storm are so thick so close and so dark  not to suffer the lightning to be visible it was forerly an custom in thunder and lightning to ring the lls in a church steeple in hopes of destroying the ect of the lightning by agitating the air with the and of the bells but it has been known to attract e lightning and bring it down upon the bells and on the ringers rather than disperse it to avoid the structive effects of this electric fire which will frequently shake the steeples of churches and other high ildings wires are now fixed to serve as conductors it has been proved that a wire raised above the top  a building and carried at a small distance down the e of such building into the ground below will attract  lightning and conduct it into the ground without doing any injury in its passage   eugen we hear almost every year of some new acci arising from thunder but i was ignorant until now t it was a natural effect i thought god had sent under always to alarm the wicked but i find by at explanation that  an element of consequence the catalogue of nat   erast it is the ve oul of nature it gives life to every thing when too much cold takes away the fire that exists even in the coldest water the wat freezes when fire ceases to warm the air the air becomes cold and frosty in short without the beni influence of fire all nature would die and the ear would produce nothing   eugen we certainly receive the greatest bene from fire it affords us light and heat and dresser o food i do believe that without its assistance men wo not be able to subsist   erast you may carry your views a great way father besides being the principle of the life both animals and vegetables it is by this that we distill rits and perform a number of chemical operation by this we melt and refine ores calcine stone a make lime to build with by this we make glass wonderful composition of ashes and sand which pvents the wind and cold entering our dwellings  yet suffering the light to pass by this also we m those glasses that assist a weak sight and those telesco by means of which we read the very heavens it is account of its many services that some have adored f as a beneficent divinity the chaldeans the persi offered sacrifices to it at rome vestals were appoint to preserve and keep up continually the sacred fire a were punished with death if they put it out   eugen you have enumerated i confess  essential services of fire but you must allow sir t its malignity in a great measure takes off from its rits we can never put any confidence in it it is  a traitor besides fire pervading the earth prod those dreadful combustions you have been describi and expanded through the air gives birth to that thunder which commits such devastation is it neces that god should suffer these things   erast these seeming disorders in nature are tainly a real good in the profound views of provide though human capacity is too limited to find it but to return to your question though the effect lightning are dangerous it is useful in the syste nature it refreshes the air and purges it of an in of noxious vapors if subterraneous fires  ose inflammable substances in the bowels of the earth that cause volcanos and earthquakes they are at he same time the prolific principle of every natural roduction the earth is spongy water sulphurous irits salts and nutritive juices are conveyed through s pores penetrate the plant feed it and make it grow d all this by the action of fire and air it is not oubted but that this internal fire exists workmen ho labor in metalic mines assure us that the lower ey go the greater is the heat especially beyond the epth of   0 feet naturalists atribute the heat of ot baths to the effects of these subterraneous fires or a mixture of pyrites or firestones which heat in disving we have in europe many springs of this kind those waters more or less hot are very beneficial in any disorders bath buxton and matlock in england audefontaine and aixlachapelle in germany he degree of heat in the last is so great as to boil an g hard in five minutes chemists have discovered in e water of hot baths a variety of matter such as re vitriol alum sulphur bitumen antimony and me particles of iron copper silver and gold they tain more or less of these different substances which ders their virtues more or less esticacious and proper  the cure of many disorders   eugen before you close the article of fire please give me some account of gunpowder   erast it was known in china a long time bee it was discovered in europe but the wise chie made no other use of it than for their amusement  example in forming a variety of artificial fires which they excelled in the year   00 it was disered in europe by one shwartz of cologne he a great chemist and grinding one day upon a stone e brimstone saltpeter and charcoal a spark of accidentally fell among the composition and with a ible explosion blew the stone into the air and filled whole laboratory with smoke such is said to be  origin of this discovery so fatal to the human race know i presume the ravage which firearms esally cannon have made throughout europe   eugen what is it gives gunpowders that force   erast it arises from the air pent up in every grain of powder and suddenly dilated by being set on fire the greater the quantity of powder and the more i is compressed the greater is the explosion and the more violent its effects nothing resembles more the noise of thunder than that which arises from the explosion of gunpowder  but the fire of the sun when its rays are concentre in the focus of a burning glass that is brought to  point by suffering the sun to shine through a thick conve piece of glass  is far more active than earthly fire  it as powerful as it may it was by this means the say that archimedes the greatest mechanist in the world burnt the roman fleet before syracuse f through such a glass the suns rays may be collected  a point at a great distance from the glass in a wo to close this subject fire pervades both the heaven and the earth and would destroy every thing if g did not confine it within certain limits and the insta he shall please to let it loose it will terminate in the universal conflagration and dissolution of the element which will put an end to the world   eugen having now entered i believe pretty ful into the heavenly bodies and into two of the element namely fire and air let me request if i have  tired you to give me some account of the other t earth and water   erast as you seem disposed at attend we w from the heavens descend upon the earth here t we are and as the waters occupy the greatest part the surface of the terrestrial globe we will be with considering the sea   eugen ow hhappy should i be to see this g element   erast in a calm when there is no wind would see immense fluid greenish plain always dulating but in no great degree at other times w the wind blows you will see it very much agitated rising successively in great billows beyond the rea the eye dashing as it were the very clouds  whole extent of the sea is not yet discovered we  that it surrounds and divides different parts of the e to different parts of the sea we give different na   eugen what is there remarkable belonging to the sea i have heard of the tides as a thing very singular   erast this phenomenon is an effect so extraordinary in the nature of water that the best natural philosophers have not yet able to pass more than some rational conjectures on its true cause it seems as if it pleased god to conceal this among a number of other secrets of nature which are impenetrable to the human mind however the general opinion is that the sun and particularly the moon are mostly concerned in the flux and reflux of the sea the waters of the sea in the flux flow or are gently drawn from south to north for the space of six hours in the reflux they employ the same time in returning from north to south resting about a quarter of an hour between the ebb and flow and the flow and ebb when it has lowed its six hours the water is considerably higher in the place to which it has flowed and we call it high water at that place when it has returned or ebbed its ix hours we say it is low water but this periodical low and ebb is not general in all seas nor equal   eugen can you give me no farther account of it   erast these tides are of great use when there is little or no wind in carrying vessels up certain rivers n their flow and conveying them back again in the me of ebb they are of similar use about the coasts and carry ships at the rate of about five miles an hour the moon acts upon the water according to a reeived opinion by attraction that is to say it raises or raws the water toward it at some certain situations her course round the earth at which time it occasions swell of the sea in that part directly under the oon and of course as the waters rise in one place e waters from other parts will run there this casions the current in certain directions   eugen if this was general there would be a tide all rivers which i understand is not the case   erast i told you it was by no means general in ers of little or no breadth where the moon cannot in one part stronger than in another there will be tide for the attraction being equal in such narrow streams the water cannot shift or move from one place to another so as to cause a flux and reflux   eugen is the moons power of attraction always the same in the same parts   erast no it has a greater attraction at new and full moon than at the first or third quarter for the situation of the moon with the respect to the sun at the new and full is such that the sun conspires with the moon at those times to attract the waters and causes a higher tide than when the moon is in the first or third quarters at new and full moon the tides are called springtides and rise nine or ten feet above the level of the water at low water mark when the moon is in the first and third quarter the water does not rise so high and the tides are then called neaptides from the time of neaptide to that of springtide the water rise every tide more and more till they get to the highest from springtide to neaptide they gradually fall more and more   eugen does not the tide alter its time of flowing every day   erast it does and is in this regulated by the moon for as the moon rises every day fifty minute later than the day before so does the sea rise also that is it flows  0 minutes later to give you a better o clearer account of it it would be necessary to explain it by drawings i have said enough to give you general idea which is all i aim at   eugen i understand it very well and am much obliged to you i have been told that seawater  not fit to drink what is this owing to   erast because it is salt and bitter and of marshy smell these qualities render it disagreeable to the taste though it may not be so to a great man who live almost wholly upon the sea the czar pet the great obliged his sailors to accustom their children to drink nothing but seawater and they all die masters of vessels always provide fresh water for the ships company before they fail the important seen of making salt water fresh to a certain degree ha indeed been discovered for some years and most se men know how to do it but they have recourse to the method only upon urgent occasions seawater is heavier than riverwater will of course float greater burdens and it is on account of its weight that it evaporates more and freezes less it is also more or less salt in certain places do not imagine that the salt it contains is useless providence has made nothing in vain the sun by its heat attracts from the surface of the sea a quantity of vapors impregnated with light particles of salt these vapors rise in the air and form clouds they fall again in rain in snow in hail and sprinkle the land and by the salts they contain assist vegetation besides seawater affords us salt for our different wants they make it at the seaside and those places where they make it are called salt pits they pump in a quantity of water into hallow pits leave it there some time to be evaporated by the sun by which means the water is exhaled and the salt remains after this to purify it and make it white they boil it in vessels till it is dry and fit for use   eugen the sea affords us still greater benefits for example fish in the greatest abundance is it known sir how many sorts there are   erast the sea is a liquid world peopled with an sinity of inhabitants different in species in size and manner of living we are acquainted with a great many but there are probably many we are unacquainted ith we find some particular kinds of fish in certain as and other fish in other seas as cod on the banks of newfoundland some come in shoals at particular imes as herrings and mackrell others alone some eep about the coasts others out at sea some never quit be mud that is they crawl at the bottom others im near the top the greatest number of fishes are iparous that is to say the young spring from the awn or eggs of the female which are impregnated y the male others are viviparous that is produce their young completely formed some fish are covered ith skins others with scales and others with shells ue sort is good to eat another for different uses ome they catch after one manner some after another almost all fish are fish of prey and feed upon others at the voracious are the least prolific whilst those which serve others for prey multiply prodigiously so that no one species can be thoroughly destroyed the creator has given to fishes as to other animals instinct and a means of procuring their subsistence every species has its mode of attack its art of defense and method of stealing away from the pursuit of its enemy   eugen you can tell me no doubt many remarkable things of fishes   erast as far as my reading and some few conversations i have had upon the subject has enabled me  the whale is called the queen of the sea because she is the greatest fish and the largest of the watery tribe whales have been taken from   0 to  00 feet in length but they are in general about  0 or  0 feet long the head of a whale is of an enormous size and is about a third of its whole length but its eye are no larger than the eyes of an ox its whole strength and defense is in its tail which is very large it live upon small fish which abound in the north seas it  chiefly on the coasts of greenland and about spitsberge that they are caught the dutch are annually at great expense in this fishery the fat of the wha yields a quantity of train oil which is a great artic of commerce with the dutch many ships go annual from englands and to encourage the fishery which with the god fishery at newfoundland is a nursery s seamen government gives a bounty for every what that is brought home it is this fish alone that yield the whalebone the whale and other fishes of t like kind which we call cetaceous are viviparou they carry their young nine or ten months and ha only one or two young whales at a time which the suckle a year great whales lay themselves up un the ice which they pierce to take air for they can remain more than half an hour under water with coming to the surface to breathe they have two tu on the head through which they throw up the w to a great height and with great noise   eugen i am curious to know how they are cau   erast i will tell you then an expert str sailor throws a harpoon at the whale which is an pole about five or six feet long with a barbed point and a rope fastened at the other end as soon as the whale feels this stick in its back it flies and the cord which is of great length is suffered to run out with the whale the fish is pursued with boats and presently oses its strength with its blood and expires on the surface of the water when dead they cut it up as it ies on the water and take only on board such parts of tas are useful   eugen are there any other great fishes   erast there is the seaunicorn so called on account of a long tooth it carries on the left side of its pper jaw this fish is a great enemy to the whale there is a swordfish that has a bone in his nose like sword that attacks and combats the whale and puts  to flight there is also the porpoise and the dolphin which are large fishes the dolphin by no means resembles what painters describe it it is a ery swift swimmer being continually in pursuit of mall fishes of which it devours a prodigious quantity  different seas yield different kinds of fishes but among sea monsters one of the most mischievous and oracious and which is found almost every where is e shark they have been seen twentyfive feet long is called the tyrant of the seas it makes cruel war ith other fishes and has been known to swallow a an whole even when he was armed some have imagined that it was in the belly of this fish that the prophet jonah lived three days   eugen i should dread the teeth of this monstrous h if i was out at sea are these sir the only remarkable fishes   erast there are many of an amphibious kind at is such as live both by land and by water for ample the seacow the seawolf the seabear d the sealion who have only two feet which are hands or fins to swim with whereas all other fishes ve four fins these frequent great rivers they e been known to weigh from  000 to   00lb weight they continue more or less time in the water and then out of the water are found feeding reposing or ping upon the ice upon a rock or upon the shore it is at this time they are generally taken the tortoise is also a kind of amphibious shellfish of which there are three species landtortoises seatortoises or turtle and those of fresh water the tortoise or turtle is oviparous and lives a long time its flesh and eggs are good to eat travelers affirm that they have seen turtles ten feet long and seven feet wide a single one has yielded two hundred weight of flesh a female turtle lays more than one hundred and fifty large eggs they are found in the sand on the shore in holes where they are deposited a fat turtle will yield more than thirty pints of oil drawn from its grease this oil is good in cookery when new and fi to burn when old the fat has even a good flavor will keep and supply the place of butter in a word the shell is beautiful and serves to make a variety of curious things in some seas they find turtles in abundance  it would be unnecessary to acquaint you with tha multitude of fishes that is brought from the coasts t market and those various species of shellfish such a oysters muscles crabs lobsters etc which you ha frequently seen i will trouble your memory only with a few other singularities which the sea presents for example we find in the american isles a fish who skin and scales are red at cape comorin they have what they call the goldenfish which takes its nam from a circle round the eye and a streak from the head to the tail of a golden color in the east indies there are small fishes black and white scattere with spots of gold and silver the great men of th country keep them as a curiosity in warm climate there are fishes they call flyingfish because they jump out of the water when pursued by their enemy an fly in the air for some little distance there is a fi in the mediterranean called the crampfish which will benumb the arm that touches it while living by sudden stroke that it gives there is among the she fish one called a seahedgehog covered with sha points which it makes use of to roll itself in the mu there is another fish called nautilus which resembles little boat its skin is arranged in such a way as to serve  a sail so that it is driven upon the waves by the wind there is another like an eel called the torpedo which then touched emits sparks of electric sire and will give n electric shock specimens of these fishes are preerved by the curious in their cabinets in the eastern eas are caught in great abundance a kind of oyster those shell is motherofpearl and in which pearls are ound the most valuable pearl we have in europe ecorates the crown of the kings of spain it is as arge as a pidgeons egg   eugen i have heard persons talk of mermaids alf women and half fish that is women to the raist and fish from the waist downwards is there uch a thing   erast naturalists still doubt it but if we can beieve particular writers there seems testimony enough o establish it we read in the history of england that in   0  a mermaid was taken off the coast of ffolk which bore so near a conformity with man that it seemed to want nothing but the speech we are lso told that in west friestand some girls in    0 aught one that was floundering in the mud that hey took it home dressed it in womens apparel and aught it to spin it fed like one of them but ever would try to speak another writer says they aught it some notions of a deity and it would bow ith reverence when it passed a crucifix another acount wellattested says that in    0 some fishermen caught in the east indies seven mermen and maids and other writers make mention of such creatures being aught at other times but as such monsters have not een seen of late years i am myself in doubt about it   eugen how wonderful is the creator in his prouctions and what singularities does the sea alone fford   erast i could mention many others if it would ot be entering too minutely into the subject but before i quit it i would have you observe that the ottom of the sea in many places resembles a sort of ountry it is covered with moss with turf with herbs with roots with plants and shrubs innumerable of different kinds colors size and form besides the retreat and nourishment these afford to a number of fishes and creeping insects which here deposit their eggs some of these plants are made use of by men in medicine and other things it would be happy for us if the uses of all were known there are still other marine productions for example coral whose fishery is very curious it is much esteemed in africa where they make a variety of pretty toys with it sponge which is found at the foot of rocks and of which great use is made in many mechanical arts let it be remembered that coral and sponge and many like substances are not seaplants as has been supposed but serve as a refuge for certain insects to lodge in   eugen is the sea very deep   erast we are assured that its common depth is about   0 fathom each fathom six feet and its greate about  00 we know also that in certain parts of the sea there are cavities and caverns especially in the center of mountains whose tops rise above the surface mariners do not so much dread these rocks that ar above water as those whose tops are below the surface and the many sandbanks and currents by them occasioned which are very dangerous to navigation  the different seas are scattered with islands that i to say with land more or less extensives surrounde with water these islands are the tops of great hill and mountains at the bottom of the sea the greate number of islands are found in the neighborhood  great continents the archipelago is a part of the mediterranean sea where there is a great quantity  islands more or less considerable and at a little distanc from each other  it is supposed that the greatest part of the island have appeared since the deluge which occasioned a universal overthrow in the surface of the earth it  probable that before the deluge the waters occupie only one side of the globe we know however tha earthquakes have sometimes raised land from the botto of the sea and formed new islands by the same effect certain islands have sunk and suddenly disappeare the ancients say that there have been moving  floating islands that is islands which have been supported on the surface of the sea without touching its bottom but we conceive this to be a fable or to have been great drifts of floating ice   eugen i have heard that seamen meet occasionally with waterspouts in their voyages which they dread approaching almost as much as a rock under water   erast waterspouts are a great quantity of water drawn up into the air by the attraction of a low cloud which seems to descend for that purpose at a distance it appears like a large funnel the small end touching the sea the broad end enveloped in the clouds under the small end the water bubbles up and appears to boil was a ship to run foul of one of these spouts the waters would break deluge the vessel and probably sink it seamen generally fire a shot at it when within reach and thus disperse it which the agitation of the air by the explosion seldom fails to do   eugen there is only one thing more on the subject of the sea that i wish to be informed of   erast what is that   eugen the nature of the mariners compass   erast this owes its origin to the lodestone a ferruginous stone found in iron mines which has the power of attracting iron the virtue of this stone was known to the ancients pliny says it was discovered by chance from a shepherds finding that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferule of his staff clung to a loadstone over which he walked but they were ignorant of that singular property it possesses of turning toward the poles we do not know to whom to attribute this important discovery the invention of the compass is given to a dutchman in the year      it is an iron needle or hand like the hand of a clock fixed on a point so as to run round and one end being touched by the loadstone which communicates its virtues to it makes it always turn to the north thus a mariner knowing what way he is to go is always directed though he es no land and what revolutions in things has the loadstone produced it has made us acquainted with the new world before this invention seamen never ventured out of sight of land but now they have traversed the whole globe it is to this we are indebted to not only for the discovery of new countries but for the rich mines of gold and silver which these countries produce and which would have been lost to us if we had never reached those shores   eugen all these particularities are worthy our knowledge but after having run through the heavens and the waters shall we turn our thoughts to the earth   erast if you please and we will penetrate its very bowels we have hitherto considered the earth as a planetary globe performing its stated revolutions according to the order which the creator has established in his arrangement of the world let us look now into it is composition and into it is internal and external productions  the earth is divided by the sea into four great quarters europe asia africa and america these different parts of the world are very different in size form climate and productions the author of nature has been pleased to throw into his work a infinite variety here are immense plains there inaccessible rocks and farther off are mountains that to the clouds the inequalities on the surface of th earth we attribute to the great overthrow of nature at the general deluge to the currents of the sea and the rivers and to subterraneous irruptions the learned presume to say that since the creation the globe has been alternately sea and land that is t say that such parts as are now land were once covert with the sea and such parts as the sea now overflow were once dry land but this is difficult to demonstrate   eugen can you tell me sir which are the highe mountains on the earth   erast the cordeliers of peru in america whi are a chain of mountains near   00 leagues in length one of these is perhaps the highest mountain in t world it reaches to the middle region of the air  summit is    0 yards above the level of the sea nearly six miles in height there are other mounta not quite so high for example mount sinai in pan the pike of teneriffe in africa mount ce in the alps mount atlas and many others and in observable that we experience more cold in eleva places particularly on the mountains than in the valies or plains   eugen why is this as being nearer the sun i should suppose the contrary   erast because the air is keener and the suns rays do not fall on them perpendicularly it is thus we see the highest mountains almost always covered with now the cold is so excessive at a certain height on the cordeliers that men and animals will freeze and become as hard as stone without putrefying   eugen what good purpose do these high mountains and deep valleys answer the earth would apparently be more beautiful and convenient had the creator made it uniform   erast his profound wisdom knew well to the contrary besides the agreeableness to the view which his irregularity of the earth affords the mountains heck the impetuosity of the winds and serve as a salury shelter to the valleys round about and frequently field them at times showers by the clouds pressing against em in their passage which condenses the water in ch clouds and causes it to fall in rain they are also a treat for wild animals useful to men for their skins and their furs and they yield a variety of plants which will grow no where else besides the hollows of ountains contain immense reservoirs of water whence oceed streams rivulets and rivers   eugen how is that possible   erast have not i told you that the sun exhaled om the earth and sea and drew up into the air an inity of watery particles that these vapors consed form clouds and fall again on the earth in n and snow the snow melts by degrees and with  rain which falls gives a great quantity of water ich is collected in the hollows of these eminences es out again by its weight and fluidity and s springs and rivers these are increased by others ich join them in their course till they reach again  sea from which they originally sprang hence are ived all those waters that circulate in the bosom the earth which is pierced with channels beyond ber water will puzzle out its way through the different stratus or beds of earth sand and stone ill it finds room to escape then it forms a spring whose waters run according to the declivity of the ground or fall into wells or reservoirs which they naturally make where they find the least cavity   eugen what sir is a cataract   erast a waterfall such for example as the cataract of niagara in north america which is perhaps the largest in the world this is a fall of a whol river a mile and a half broad it tumbles headlon from a precipice     seet high and flows with suc violence as to make an arch beneath it under which three men can walk abreast without being wet the mist it makes by its fall rises as high as the clouds and may be seen at fifteen miles distance when the sun shines upon it it forms a rainbow   eugen if all water proceeds from the sea what ocasions the freshness of river water   erast the almighty has so contrived it for the purposes of man by passing through the earth it philtred and strained of its saline particles and render refresh and such watery particles as the sun exhales form clouds which afterward fall in rains are  lighter parts of the water the saline particles being nturally too heavy to be exhaled and it is a wise prosion of providence that the rain so exhaled does  fall in large quantities which would deluge a country but in showers  i shall some day or other explain to you the g advantages we derive from streams and rivers the supply our wants as well as our pleasures and yield quantity of fishes of various kinds some riv abound with some sorts of fishes others with differ sorts and ponds agree best with others in places distance from the sea they supply our tables  riverfish in plenty in short there is scarce stream that does not yield it but the utility streams and rivers as formed by nature and those canals made by the industry of man stops not h they are of great service in transporting of lime nure merchandise coals and provisions from town to another which would be very dear and exive if conveyed by landcarriage they save a great deal of labor in other respects by turning of mills for grinding corn for forges fulling making gunpowder scowering leather and linen for making oil paper sugar spinning and twisting silk sawing of planks and other things   eugen now you mention coals you will doubtess give me some idea of mines   erast there are mines of gold and silver in all he four quarters of the world gold and silver mines ave been found in norway sweden and hungary in urope but the richest are those of america the old mines of chili are the most celebrated the ore taken from the veins of a rock with great labor many rivers in foreign countries and even in france oll a sand and spangles of gold which are collected upon the shores but in very small quantities gold and silver have been found mixed with ores in the ines of england but not in sufficient quantity to nswer the expense of separating gold is the most eavy the most ductile the most tenacious and by ese qualities the most valuable of all metals it ndergoes no change either by air or water nor even  fire would you think it possible to draw out an ce of gold into a thread of     miles in length   eugen wonderful has there never been found a ethod of making gold   erast projectors have often attempted it but uld never succeed this is called searching for the losophers stone it has been said lately that dr ce of guildford succeeded in his endeavors this y by mixing quicksilver with other materials but t the expense in obtaining it was more than the ue of the gold so obtained   eugen is quicksilver a composition   erast no it is a mineral dug out of mines oad the chief of which are in hungary spain peru it is found sometimes pure issuing out of s of stone when broken and sometimes mixed with    eugen where are the silver mines   erast the most famous silver mine is that of potofi in peru though many others have been discovered which they say are more valuable the min of potofi is more than   0 yards deep not far sh of half a mile and has been more than  00 years i working but they now begin to find its veins diminishing it is asserted that there are a great many silver min in germany saxony and hanover a block of silve was found at nantz so large as made a table at which more than twenty persons could sit besides gold an silver mines there are mines of iron lead copper an tin which employ a great number of workmen  am told there is a copper stream on the estate of gentleman in wales that by laying plates of i in it will in a very short space of time be encru all over with copper which is beaten off and melt down this must be a stream issuing from a mine  copper whose waters are strongly impregnated wi the mineral you know the usefulness of these metals but the earth produces agreeable things as well as useful ones such as precious stones of all kinds rubie saphires emeralds topazes hyahs amethysts an many others of different colors some opake font transparent and more or less valuable in proportion to their scarcity their brilliancy their beauty and the fancy of their admirers   eugen are there no brass mines   erast no brass is a composition of copper and a fossile called lapis caliminaris   eugen you have forgot the diamond is not t the most valuable of all precious stones   erast yes the most celebrated diamond mi are those of golconda and visapour in the east indie in these mines the men work naked lest they sho secret any stone of value the largest diamond  found that we know of is that among the treasu of the great mogul it is in shape and as large a hens egg out through the middle it weighs     ca four grains each carat and is valued at more the  00000l diamonds will sometimes imbibe the su rays and emit them again so as to shine in the dar   eugen no stone can be really worth that mo   erast it is vanity and luxury only that has slam a value upon such riches but there are other articles which we draw from the earth of real value articles that contribute to the use of society coals for example turf peat these serve for fuel marble of ifferent kinds stones soft and hard flints etc   eugen can you account for the formation of ese precious stones in the earth   erast they are gradually formed it is thought  the meeting and union of oily juices salts and and water which runs in the interstices of the earth rries and mixes these different principles they colct in small pebbles the water drains from them and ese little masses dry and grow hard and they are loured by metallic substances dissolved by water in ort the quality quantity and arrangement of these fferent principles are the cause of the variety the eight the form the color and brilliancy of preous stones it is the same proportionably with mines and petrifactions but i think we have conversed ough for this time the next time we meet we will  on with the subject i mean terrestrial productions   discourse vii the same subject continued eugen remember sir what you promised yesterday   erast we were got i believe to the productions the earth   eugen we were i take notice sir that you p from time to time as it were ravished with adration may i dare to enquire the object of your lections   erast from this place where the ground rises i mire with rapture the beautiful prospect my eyes d my mind are at the same time enchanted what nting could describe the vivacity the variety the ness of this great picture gardens woods meas plains valleys hills mountains a blue sky and a dazzling sun great god how wonderfully magnificent are thy works but where shall i begin the deta of so much beauty let us first contemplate the fertility of the earth the universal source of all good this fertility however which we attribute to it spring not from the earth which is in itelf a barren mass   eugen you astonish me sir what are the causes then of this fruitfulness and surprising abundance   erast water fire air salts oils and sulphu these different principles as i have told you ex in a greater or a less quantity in the bosom of the earth they collect unite ferment together gh through its pores insinuate into those of the plant  its roots and nourish it you must not believe acording to the vulgar notion that the moon has a influence over these productions it is an error w indeed has a principal part rain is the soul of all the issues from the inexhaustible bosom of this univernurse i told you i think from whence the rain pceeds   eugen you did sir drawn from the sea an all moist places by the heat of the sun the tery vapors rise in the air form clouds and fall ag in rain snow and hail with particles of sulphur a fire which being introduced with other juices in vegetables enliven them and make them grow   erast true and to this the action of the and wind which puts these principles in motion  you will describe the causes of the wonderful fertili of the earth but it is natural fertility requires to seconded by cultivation the creator in forming t earth made it fruitful so as to be to man an inexhaible garden of fruits and vegetables equally nutri as delicious without any care on his part but  moment of his revolt it changed its nature and  was condemned to labor it would not but on  account have borne briars and wild fruits the bou of the creator however permitted that the more was cultivated the more it should answer our labo so that with industry and perseverance we may  om it not only all that is necessary but all that is omfortable and agreeable to life   eugen but must the whole be cultivated in the me manner   erast no the earth varies infinitely in its soil at is in its qualities we divide the nature of lands to six different classes rich and poor strong and ght dry and wet and these primative qualities mixg together more or less vary the soil the business en of the husbandman is first to know the quality and nature of his land that he may give it such culture  it requires and sow it with such seed as it will est produce soils are different according to the imate the situation of the ground and the aspect of e sun hence arises the astonishing diversity of earthly oductions some fruits will grow on certain lands d in climates adapted to their kind which would ow no where else there are some things that will ow in africa and america that will not grow in rope and europe will produce a variety of things which cannot be found in other countries all fruits ry in their kind form and color so as to have peliar properties qualities and flavor  please to remark that there is no one habitable ace which is not adapted to the growth of something oper for the subsistence of men and animals which uld there settle   eugen let us examine now if you please the thes which the earth affords   erast we have a fine prospect to examine open ur eyes carry your view to the utmost extent re is a universal abundance among the trees at a prodigious quantiy of every kind in the woods the forests in the farms upon the roads what ices may not men draw from those lofty trees that r no fruit one is useful for building houses aner for ships some for furniture and others for l among forest trees we have the oak the elm  ash the beech the fir the poplar the alder the ch the willow and a quantity of others equally ful either to the carpenter the joiner the wheeler the carver and in other works as well for use as for pleasure among others is the corktree which grows in spain in italy and france it is the ba of this tree that yields the cork the bark is stripp off and in a year it grows again there a trees of an astonishing size and height and which live a long time the oak of king stephen the county of northampton is of an enormo size and height and in the extent of its branch four thousand persons may sit at ease under its shade it is said to be more than  00 years old and yet ther are a number of cedars in mount lebanon in palestin larger and older but of all trees the most gigant is the baobab one has been seen at senegal which seventeen it was more than eighty feet in circumferenc and yet they pretend to say there are trees still large and as old as the deluge   eugen but but sir    erast but what  do you suppose that i would deceive you  it is by such gaping surprise that th ignorant and unexperienced become ridiculous at t least extraordinary thing you see them struck wi wonder all that goes beyond the reach of their cpacity all they have not seen they conceive to  impossible there are eugenius to sorts of fools those who believe every thing and those who believe nothing to believe that which is impossible and contrary to reason is a stupid credulity to reject extraordinary things which may be true though perhap improbable because we have not seen them or because we do not comprehend them is an affectation strongly marked with obstinacy and ignorance be pesuaded my dear fellow that i am neither a deceive nor a boaster i am not even one of those who belie every thing they hear so that when i give you a account of any very singular matters you may take for granted that i speak upon the best authoritie what pleasure should i have in leading you into error i have taken too great pains to show you the indigni of an untruth to give you an example of it in mysel   eugen many persons like me are in want this lesson i will endeavor to profit by it  if we consider the different uses to which forest trees are put they are more necessary than fruit trees   erast they certainly are but what refreshment that delicates do fruit trees afford us there are fruits f a thousand species according to the seasons and acording to the climates plenty of common fruit helps n feed the poor and serves the tables of the rich a repast without fruit seems to want something essential you know likewise that we extract from certain fruits ur best liquors and on this account the vine alone those wood is scarce worth burning deferves the highst encomiums of the different branches of agriculture the vine after corn is the most considerable that which employs most hands there are a great riety of wines which differ in color taste quality and duration the best wines of france are burgundy champaigne and claret those of spain are malaga erry and mountain port is the produce of portual old hock of the countries adjoining the rhine germany and madeira of the istand of madeira f other liquors made from fruits we have cider om apples and perry from pears in provence ere is an abundance of olive trees trees which yield the reet oil  among a number of trees that grow in foreign counies the cocoanuttree so common in america is oft admired it is of all trees that which is turned  most uses it is wood it is leaves it is bark it is nuts ich are larger than a mans head and which contain perfect fruit an excellent liquor is made from the fruit d it affords milk for children we find also in the same ntry the cacoa whose flowers give the cocoa and ose fruit yields the chocolate the coffee is another markable tree it grows fifty feet high though its ok is not more than four or five inches in diameter yields fruit two or three times a year in great abunce the best coffee is that of moka in arabia ich is brought to us through turkey though it is a cultivated in america the tea is another rerkable tree and is the produce of china and  chief article of commerce carried on by the east ia company   eugen you have not named the trees of this country   erast no indeed the list would be too long   eugen what are those trees that are called eoticks   erast they are the produce of warm climate and are brought here merely as curiosities cold wether is such a mortal enemy to them that such persons as wish to keep them here are obliged to hou them in the winter and warm the places where the stand with fires   eugen once sir when i was walking in a garden saw the gardener cut off the head of a young tree  the trunk and place in it some twigs of a tree of a dferent kind   erast that we call grasting there are seve ways of performing this operation one of which called budding that is taking the bud of one t and slipping it within the bark of another but th have all the same end in view that of making a barren wild tree bear the best fruits every good garden knows how to graft and to bud   eugen how pray does this change of nat operate in the body of the wild tree   erast it operates by the circulation of the  or juices that flow in the body of the tree from root to its leaves it is the sap that enlivens it nrishes and makes it grow it flows continually it parts of vegetables as the blood circulates in the b of animals the true cause of the cirulation of sap is yet one of the mysteries of nature even  of the blood we were ignorant of till was discover by harvey an english physician in      it is the fore now know that the blood is constantly flow from the heart all round the body and limbs to heart again and it is it is motion that gives the pul   eugen to think of the infinite variety of productions of the earth one would say that the nificence and bounty of the creator had not on view the utility of man but also his pleasures all ture abounds with delights the fields ename with flowers seem natural parterres when i see country in may i think i see so many beds of jonq and other flowers and those blooming shrubs with which our gardens abound   erast what would you say was you to walk in ome of the magnificent gardens in holland where a orist will spend l  00 a year in flowers there re an infinite variety of fieldflowers equally as gardenowers some more fragrant and beautiful than others ut all perfect in their kind indeed all flowers as uits were originally wild and it is cultivation only that has brought them to their present perfection  but you must know that besides their beauty and agrance many of these flowers as well as a variety f plants are of real use to man by their medicinal roperties there is scarce an herb but what has me noxious or salutary virtue with this distinction oever that the number of poisonous plants as well  mineral poisons a venomous animals are very w in comparison to others many noxious vegetaes were their virtues known would perhaps cure forders that now seem incurable arsenic which is tank poison is of use in medicine and quicksilver which if taken without caution would kill is a spefic in some disoders the effect of the simple bark of tree which grows in peru and which we know by the me of bark is a certain cure in intermittent fevers ubarb is the root of a shrub in tartary and ipecana which is an emetic is the root of another shrub  brazil what an able physician my friend is the ther and universal preserver of nature   eugen he is truly our father from the care he takes us when i consider particular gardens those of e kitchen and orchard and cast my eyes on the greatest rden of all this immense country where all sorts of oduction abound i do not know which to admire ost the power or the goodness of the creator   erast your reflection is sensible see what a progious quantity of grain the surface of the earth esents us now near the end of harvest the most uable part of it wheat that which constitutes the ff of life and is the support of man is almost gared in the rest to be gathered such as oats beans d the like is designed for the feed of beasts  but take notice of the profound wisdomof the creat in the fruitfulness of the plains in general we have so a stalk of wheat bear thirtytwo ears each ear containi from forty to fifty grains so that there has been  increase of   00 from one increase taken in genera has been still greater in egypt since according  pliny one bushel of wheat has yielded more the   0 bushels it is an attention of providence wo remarking that of all grain that which is particular destined for the support of man is most universal a most fruitful   eugen if wheat then would keep a length of tim and sufficient stores were laid by in fruitful season there never could be any fear of dearth   erast if do you say it will keep a great whi with care and management we know that the roman have preserved wheat in the ear more than fifty year by laying it in cavities in the ground and covering with straw so as in a great measure to keep it from  air from wet and from insects in   0  was four in the citadel at metz a subterraneous place wh there was a vast quantity of corn it had been the more than   0 years louis the xivth of fran and all his court eat of the bread made from t wheat and found it good the dutch with wh land is so scarce that they have no ground to sow co supply their markets from distant places they ha large magazines and a method of preserving it  this prudent conduct they keep up at all times equal plenty and it is not much dearer at one ti than another they even have enough to supply oth nations with it when wanted and derive a profit exportation   eugen i remark that the country not only splies us with necessaries but with a thousand conveent things   erast it yields flax and hemp with which make linen and cordage the coleseed produces  and a variety of other plants are useful in other wa i should never have done was i to enumerate the ma benefits of nature and that wonderful variety there even in the form of her productions no plant not a leaf resembles each other if we reflect on that prodigious fruitfulness which the creator has bestowed upon the seed of each plant to perpetuate its species we shall find it a miracle it is calculated that a single elm has in its body more than   000 millions of germs very dislinct each germ containing an elm which again contains a like quantity for reproduction  let us now proceed to an examination of nimals   eugen i am eager for the task this part of the works of the almighty will afford us variety of observations how extensive it is having discoursed of ishes it remains to enquire into birds insects and ourfooted beasts   erast you begin eugenius to know the prinipal difference which characterizes the animal race those which swim those which fly those which creep and those which walk as we yesterday examined he first class let us now run through the three others beginning with birds  animals in general are naturally endowed with  particular instinct to know how to conduct themselves o seek their own good to foresee and avoid danger to tach themselves to their own species and to perpeate it they are sensible of pleasure pain love atred jealousy friendship and frequently even of ratitude in short this instinct is so certain and so wonderful that we are often led to think it reason was i to speak of all birds i should tire you with the etail i will therefore confine myself to those which re remarkable  those birds then which live upon flesh we call arnivorous and those which prey upon others rapaous   eugen why is the eagle called the king of birds s it larger than all the rest   erast no but it is the fiercest the most couagious and the strongest for its size it is also a ery swift flier there are several species of them in gure this bird resembles a parrot it has a curved ll short feet with very stong hooked talons it as a piercing eye lives a long time and is an inhabitant of cold countries the eagle chooses the top of the highest trees or the clifts of the steepest rocks to build its nest in there are a great many of these birds in the north of scotland and in the mountain of switzerland the largest species of this bird ha strength enough to take up a sheep or a child a peasant once knocked one down with a pole that would have taken away a child of five years old   eugen it is then a very dangerous bird i supose there are more voracious birds   erast we reckon birds of prey among this clas such as hawks of which there are several kinds diferent in size in plumage and in swiftness these a continually at war with other birds would you blieve it there is a species of these rapacious birds  example the goshawk and falcon which they tuout in pursuit of game they train them up for  purpose a man carries them upon his wrist and wh and bird is in view he lets the hawk loose who fl after the bird darts down upon it and brings it his master in his talons who then treats the ha with the entrails of the bird it has caught for its pai this sport is a royal diversion but among the cnivorous birds there is one more terrible still   eugen is it possible what is it   erast the contor it is a bird of peru perhaps the largest in the world they have been s when flying to be more than thirty feet across  wings judge of the strength of this tyrant of air when it has appeared it has frightened w herds of cattle and their herdsmen it has a b calculated to rip open the belly of an ox tw  them will destroy an ox i have been told they devour children ten or twelve years old but b act of providence this destructive bird is very  the female lays only sufficient eggs to perpetuat species otherwise it would be too noxious an an there is one in the collection of the royal socie london which was killed at chili by some peop the suite of an english gentleman   eugen let us drop the subject of these birds they make me shudder and let me kno there is not some equally curious though not so mischievous   erast i could name many for example the cassiowary one of the tallest and largest birds in india i have seen one in the king of frances museum more than five feet high the cassiowary is remarkable for its long black shining feathers that resemble hair but of all birds the tallest is the ostrich common in africa although its body is rather small the ostrich like the cassiowary does not fly but both are so swift of foot that i is difficult to keep up with them even on the fleetest horses ostrich feathers are large and beautiful we dye them of various colors and use them for ornament its down or hair serves to make hats or bonnets this bird like many others will swallow iron flint and other hard substances in order to assist digestion but they do not digest it as people have supposed they say also erroneously that the imprudent ostrich deposits its eggs in the sand and leaves them to the care of the sun when it is certain that they sit on them in the night though they leave them in the day knowing that burning heat of the climate is sufficient to hatch them  among our european birds you have seen the peacock so remarkable for the beauty of its plumage   eugen and the horridness of its cry i hate the bird on this account   erast you would not say so of the nightingale   eugen oh no if its clothing be not so gaudy ts voice is enchanting there is no inhabitant of the groves that can vie with it in melody   erast they say that besides its melodious notes he nightingale has an excellent memory that it will etain a whole song and repeat it with the same modution of voice with which it was sung having made ou acquainted with the largest birds i will now give ou some account of the smallest   eugen what is it sir   erast the humming bird this bird so comon in america especially the male is a masterpiece f nature it is wonderful not only in the variety and reliness of its colors but also in the littleness of its body it is not bigger than a small nut there is in canada a species still smaller called the birdfly which is not larger than a great fly its flight however is extremely rapid could you suppose it this small bird will attack a crow and beat it down from the middle of the air it is so beautiful a bird that the indians make earrings of it   eugen and the parrot does it not merit our attention   erast certainly it is perhaps the most wonderful bird in the world not only for the beauty of its feathers but its faculty of imitating the human voice this is a native of america they reckon more than fifty species of parrots different in figure in size and in color they fly in flocks and live in the forests in a cage they will eat any thing and may be fed with any thing except flesh which is not good for them   eugen i should admire the parrot beyond any bird if it was not so dirty so humoursome and so clamorous your are doubtless acquainted with other particuarities among birds   erast shall we enter upon those of passage who go and come according to the seasons quails for example pass from africa to europe in the spring and return toward the end of autumn you may see them traverse the mediteranean sea in flocks they are frequently taken on board ship where they alight to re themselves as they love a moderate climate an africa is too hot in summer they pass that season i europe and as the cold is too sharp here in winter they then go to africa there are also other birds o passage wild geese and ducks cranes woodcock snipes and many more whose instinct leads them  select those countries that agree best with them so fly in confused flocks others preserve order and t in rows in order to cut the air the better that whi flies first is relieved from time to time by others  it is imagined that swallows who appear in t spring pass a great part of the winter in europ although such as leave us about the end of autumn frequently caught in great quantities on the decks ships tired with flying the truth is those of the northern countries of europe do not go away in winter they are found in sweden collected in heaps hanging upon one another in a torpid state in hollow places they quicken and appear again with the first warm weather  it is very singular that all these birds foresee the time to depart collect themselves together fly night and day and go to the place designed without wandering where is the traveller who in so long a journey would not be obliged to enquire his way   eugen they are certainly directed by providence for who but him can give so much foresight to animals   erast say not only foresight but address and sagacity you have taken notice of the structure of a birds nest these architects have no other tools than their beaks and their feet you see however how curiously they build their houses and how carefully they line them that their callow young may lie sot what mason could build a swallows nest which is contructed of mud and hangs under the eves of houses the nests of the titmouse and wren are masterpieces of industry the most able artist could not make one like them how wonderful is the care and exactness of all birds in sitting upon their eggs and sufficient ngth of time to hatch their young how attentive are ey afterward to feed them and bring them up see ith what resolution a hen will defend her chickens from a dog was it a bulldog she would put it  flight  shall i relate to you now the birds that live equally  land and by water such have their feet webbed at is provided with a membrane spread between their es for the purpose of swimming they are covered th down and feathers so compact as to keep out the ter some have long beaks adapted to raking in t mud where they find their food others are fishers d live upon fishes such as the cormorant the kinger and others others again live upon herbs and suction as the waterhen and seaduck there are d that are enemies to the day and fly only in the night as owls and bats of all birds the bat is the only one that does not lay eggs this is rather a flying mouse being covered with hair and having the head and body of a mouse you have seen them i dare say it flies about at dusk and is called a flittermouse it suckles its young and brings forth two at a time there are several species of this animal which seems to have nothing of the bird but the power of flying   eugen by the detail you have given me i am now acquainted with most of the feathered tribe will you next give me some account of insects and reptiles   erast nothing is more wonderful than the manner in which the creator has peopled the universe with animals of all kinds and we may say that insects a vile as they may appear are one of the principal productions of nature the greatness and wisdom of god is not more conspicuous than in these little animals  there is an infinity of insects the air the earth the waters swarm with them some are pleasing t look at others hideous some are useful others hurtful there are infinitely more invisible than such as we see some fly and others crawl there is one insect the most remarkable of any and at the same time the most useful of any   eugen that is i suppose the silkworm   erast you are right you know that it is from this we draw that most delicated thread that compose our finest silks the silkworm was brought into europe from the east indies about the year   0 its labor is very curious at first this insect is only the egg of a butterfly or moth in the spring the he hatches it and it becomes a small worm a caterpilla which grows very fast and is nourished by the leaves  the mulberrytree when this worm has changed i skin three times its growth is finished it then spi about itself a cod or pod of silk in the middle of which it forms a retreat in something like a tender shell  enclosure in which it shuts itself up thence it become a chrysalis that is envelloped in a case and afterward a moth or butterfly when come to this state pierces it cod and comes out some days after it la its eggs and dies a single moth will lay more the  00 eggs which are preserved till the next year this metamorphosis or change is common so many kinds of insects as caterpillars bees and wasps which from worms hatched from eggs become chrysales and then flies or flying insects  you have no doubt taken notice of the ant it gives us an example of industry ants will assemble many together to draw a little piece of wood or a grain of corn to the bottom of their subterraneous granaries it has been supposed that they hoard it up in magazines to feed themselves in winter but we have known that they remain benumbed and without eating all this season heaped up upon one another in an anthill in certain countries there are larger ants that very much incommode the inhabitants   eugen and the bees sir is not their industry and labor very remarkable   erast very a hive of bees has been compared to a republic where each subject labors for the common good and where all things are kept in good order there is in all hives the mother be which is called the queen she is larger longer and brighter colored than the rest this mother lays all the eggs from which the whole hive of bees are hatched she is so fruitful that in the course of a year she will sometimes give life to more than  0000 bees the bees have such an attachment to their queen or common parent that was she to die they would disperse or suffer themselves to perish wherever she goes they will follow her some men have searched for this queen be and having found it placed it on their arm and the whole swarm have there followed it they will not sting unless rudely treated or roughly handled when the hive it too full of bees the young ones will swarm out and establish themselves in some other place bees are very useful on account of the honey and the wax that they yield and which they collect from flowers and deposit in the money combs within the hive   eugen you do not appear to me sir to have described that quantity of flies and gnats which we every where see i admire very much the surprising variety of figures and colors in butterflies   erast would you suppose that in france they carry collections of butterflies to a foolish excess there have been people who have ruined themselves in collecting of flies the finest butterflies that we have seen in the cabinets of the curious are from the indies   eugen i have been often struck in the evenings with the brightness of glowworms   erast it is only in great heat of weather that glowworms throw out this light but there are still more luminous insects in america travelers have related that sometimes the americans have made use of no other light in their huts and that to this day when they walk out at night they take one of these insects in their hands and fasten one to each foot these are by some called the lanternfly they give as much light as a lamp so as to enable us to read and write by them there are other things that will give light in the dark lobstershells touchwood and other things and there are substances that will take fire of themselves when exposed to the air without any fire being communicated to them phosphorus for example which i a chemical mixture producing a powder but to retur to our subject since we are on the subject of reptiles i will make you acquainted with one that has drawn the attention of naturalists more than all the rest   eugen pray what is that   erast the polypus it is a little worm of the figure of a hollow tube there are several species of them this worm is sometimes taken for an aquati plant it lengthens and contracts itself at pleasure i breeds prodigiously and what is most astonishing contrary to the common order of animals it produces without the assistance of a male cut a polypus in five parts and each part will become a complete animal which will produce others before even the first shall be quit separated from the trunk of the old polypus what have advanced concerning this worm is the opinion  the ancients though some moderns have supposed it  fable and to imply a republic of little animals labourin to form a colony like the metropolis from whence the sprung  we may take notice here of another phenomenon the reproduction of snails naturalists assure us that if we cut off the head of one it will not die but get a new one a learned observer of modern times published a tract containing the sentiments of many celebrated natural historians it has been said that the four horns which the snail shoots out and draws in at pleasure are a kind of telescopes through which it sees but this observer maintains the snail has no eyes but that these horns are a kind of very sensible antennae which nature has given the reptile and which it puts forth to feel whether any thing approaches it if this be the case it is perhaps of all animals the only one that is deprived of sight which even the mole is not without   eugen this is very singular but how is it that men apply themselves to the study of objects so little important for my part i do not see the use of it   erast i agree with you that in the study of nature there are many things which are objects of mere curiosity but the human mind is insatiable for knowledge besides when in the examination of smaller objects we seek only to contemplate the infinite wisdom of the creator this consideration is not unuseful to man nor unworthy of him since nothing that exists is judged unworthy of the great author of nature but let us not lose our time in reflections   eugen are there any other reptiles   erast yes and very dangerous ones especially serpents different countries have different species of serpents there are some which we have no reason to dread they are so familiar some are winged others amphibious there are some more than twenty feet long which attack and destroy the largest quadrupeds there are water serpents and serpents of the sea of a prodigious size and very formidable to seamen among other serpents we reckon the rattlesnake as one so dangerous and yet so common in america in nunidia many persons have been destroyed by the bite of serpents the viper a kind of adder is viviparous whereas all other adders are oviparous the asp is another species of serpent which the ancients considered is one of the most venomous they say it throws the person they bite into a lethargic state and thus destroys him history says it was thus cleopatra queen of egypt put an end to her existence that she might not fall under the power of augustus we hardly know now to what species of serpents to give the name of asp but that which we call the asp in europe and which resembles the viper is not venomous besides we never fail of remedies abainst the venom of serpents it is remarkable that in countries where there  the greatest quantity of venomous animals there  found the greatest collection of simples and counterpoisons many of these reptiles are very useful in medicine we employ the viper for the cure of many disorders the oil and powder of the scorpion whose bite is mortal are excellent remedies we cure the wound made by many animals by bruising them upon the wound viper oil is a cure for the bite of a viper in short there is none even to the toad that is not of use in medicine snakes have been thought venomous but there are persons who hunt them and eat them   eugen among insects is not the spider for example poisonous   erast in certain countries the spider is very large and venomous what is related of the bite of the tarantula is singular it is a kind of spider very common in calabria they pretend to say that it will make some sing others laugh and others cry and that the cure is brought about by the sound of some musical instrument which sets the patient a dancing till he faints with exercise but all this is mere trick these spiders are no more dangerous than ours which have been eaten with safety   eugen what a wonderful spinner the spider is  how is this accounted for   erast the spider is furnished with six nipples from whence flows that matter of which its web is drawn the female spider forms a cod of silk about its eggs in the year   0  a person at montpelier collecte enough of this silk to make a pair of stockings and  pair of mittens which he sent to the academy of science at paris   eugen this discovery would not probably have been very useful in commerce have you finished your observations on reptiles and insects   erast i shall soon have done all i would further observe is that in insects and reptiles the male is commonly smaller then the female whereas in quadrupeds it is the largest of the two i would add that by the assistance of a microscope which is an instrument that magnifies exceedingly it has been found that there is an infinity of living animals swimming in all liquors floating in the air and swarming in the earth much smaller than a handworm which the eye can scarcely discern would you believe that in a drop of the infusion of an herb of vinegar or of blood we discover by a glass a multitude of animalcula or small animals of different kinds which move with great agility millions of insects are spread thoughout the air where they are invisible and the eggs which they deposit in liquors are hatched there by fermentation in short when we come to consider that every one of these living atoms has eyes and the different parts of an organized body that there are in these several parts muscles nerves veins blood and all things of which an animal body consists and almost imperceptible what are we to think of the supreme artist that formed them   eugen we cannot sufficiently adore his infinite powers   erast but we shall have now a new motive of adoration and gratitude in his magnificence and bounty it remains that we examine into quadrupeds that is fourfooted animals he has created the greatest number to supply the wants and convenience of men they are also exceedingly varied in figure in nature and in instinct   eugen let us begin our review with those animals that are useful   erast it is natural so to do among these you must be sensible we owe the first rank to horned beasts and those which furnish us with wool how great is this benefit to man if a hen is a little treasure to him by laying as some will  00 eggs in a year a cow is a great one she supplies us with milk with butter and with cheese and gives us each year a calf what a consumption is there at our tables of beef and veal what is more healthy or more nourishing if we are in want of horses to cultivate the land or draw heavy burdens the ox comes to our assistance it is employed in draught in many countries though slower it is capable of more fatigue than a horse and is fed at less expense after he has worked some years he is fatted and killed and his flesh is brought to market neither do his services end with his life his skin tanned is valuable this gives leather in short the gall the blood the fat the bones the horns the guts the hair and even the dung of this animal is converted to some useful purpose   eugen you cannot say so much of the sheep   erast a agree with you as to services of strength but in every other respect this animal so timid and which seems so pitiful in itself is very valuable to man since it supplies us at the same time with food and raiment not to mention the other advantages we draw from its tallow its skin its guts and its bones the flesh of mutton is light succulent and of easy digestion the milk of the sheep is sweet and wholesome befides we know that the wool is one of the greatest objects of commerce and how much its use is extended it is different in quality and sheep themselves vary very much in different climates we call the male of the sheep a ram many sheep have horns upon their heads some are covered with hair instead of wool in spain the wool is much finer than with us and our best cloths are made of spanish wool the tails of the sheep at the cape of good hope weigh fifteen or twenty pounds and are broad enough to turn back and cover their whole backs in tartary such tails have weighed near eighty pounds   eugen you will have much to say to doubt of the horse   erast you are so well acquainted with this animal that it is needless to describe him i will observe to you only that he is endowed with a wonderful instinct the relate very singular acts of his goodnature and h character we have heard of an old horse feeding between two young ones and that the young ones chewe his hay and oats of him and presented it to him in his manger the horse is reckoned old at twelve years of age though he sometimes lives twenty or thirty after seven or eight years old he diminishes in value in proportion as his age advances   eugen the ass i presume deserves but little attention   erast the ass does not deserve the contempt it meets with his long ears perhaps is one cause this animal in however very useful it lives upon little and can bear a great deal of fatigue and the milk of the female is reckoned very salutary to consumptive habits in some countres the ass is swiftfooted in some parts of france they run post with asses as they do in spain with mules arabian asses are excellent for riding they get on so fast that no horses can keep up with them  mules are a distinct species they are engendered between an ass and a mare as mules are of two natures nited they are very rare for they never breed themselves they are reckoned very surefooted and in spain they breed them with care and sell them at a great price   eugen you have named i think the principal animals but there are more quadrupeds the one domestic as the dog the cat and so on others wild as the hare the rabbet the goat and there are others again that are dangerous and hurtful as the wolf the ox the wild boar  i hope you will speak of all in urns   erast was i to do this i might go on till tomorrow i cannot however pass over all of the in lence you mention the dog for example it is ne of the animals endowed with most perfect instinct one would even suppo him to have reason so much understanding has he industry and sagacity one phisopher advances that beasts are merely machines another that the souls of devils lodge in the bodies of imals but we smile at the singularity not to say the xtravagance of their systems the dog is of all domestic animals the most attached to men he is caressing obedient and submissive he is not even discouraged by blows but is the more serviceable   eugen that is true for i have seen six dogs harnessed to a small loaded cart and they have drawn it in obedience to the whip of their master   erast i have seen a dog too turn a spit by putting him in a wheel that runs round but they render us greater services they hunt guard the house and the flocks of their master what fidelity they possess they are the very emblem of this virtue many dogs have broke their hearts and died for the loss of their master i had a spaniel that suffered himself to die with jealousy because i placed my affections upon another little dog many have defended the life of their master at the expense of their own others have discovered the assassin in short there  thousand remarkable things of the fidelity the address and other qualities of the dog but let us leave him and a multitude of other animals which are spread through different countries and are natives of different climates and come to the king of animals   eugen you mean the lion   erast i do perhaps he might be better name the tyrant of the woods we call him the king because be has apparently more courage and more strength than all animals besides his air is noble and fierce when he is angry his eyes sparkle his roar alone will frighten the inhabitants of the forests every beast fly him he is a great hunter and preys upon every anima he seizes the lion however is the emblem of generosity as he is the symbol of courage there are man stories to prove him full of gratitude the followin in one among the rest a knight of malta being o a hunting heard some dreadful cries he advance and saw a lion entwined with a great serpent touche with compassion he killed the reptile without wounding the lion from that moment the lion became attache to his deliverer and would not quit him the knigh being about to embark on board a ship they told hi they had not sufficient provisions on board the vessel  take charge of the lion they determined therefo to leave him on the shore the animal seeing the vest depart set up a hideous cry threw himself into the sea and swam after the ship till he could swim no longer and was drowned   eugen what a wonderful act in a beast it must be allowed sir that animals frequently set us examples of a good disposition which we do not follow so closely as they do you said the lion was the strongest animal is not the elephant stronger   erast yes but then it is much larger it is the tallest and biggest of all animals it is a living colossus they have been seen more then fifteen feet high there are many elephants in asia and africa but those of the east indies are the largest the figure of an elephant is unlike that of every other quadruped it is a heavy mass without proportion it has two great teeth on each side of its mouth which are its weapons of defense besides this it has a long nose like a tube with which it takes up its food and which it uses as a hand the elephant eats a great deal though it can stay seven or eight days without eating or drinking although very heavy it is swift of foot and can gallop but it does not turn readily this animal though wild is very docile being easily tamed there is nothing to fear from it but when it is irritated we derive great services from the prodigious strength of the elephat it will carry more than  000 pounds formerly they were used in war towers full of bowmen and archers were placed upon their backs and they pushed on among the thickest atallions men horses machines all give way to their normous weight the greatest enemy of the elephant is the tiger the lion the rhinoceros serpents and specially man by the various means he makes use of o kill him or to tame him there are various ways of king them hunting the elephant is one of the great easures of asiatic princes the africans who take im only for what he produces dig in their way holes which they cover over lightly and in which they freuently fall others dare to attack them openly some onderful things are related of the instinct and chacter of this animal of his docility his understanding is address his affection and gratitude for his conduc we allow him even the sense of shame all these qualities are the cause of the great veneration the elephant is held in by many people at siam  00 officers are employed in the service of a white elephant he is lodged in a magnificent pavilion walks under a canopy and is served in vessels of gold eastern nations are foolish enough to believe that the soul of their emperors pass after their death into the body of an elephant i shall close this long account with telling you that it is a longlived animal and that its great teeth yield the ivory of which so much use is made  the rhinoceros is the most curious and after the elephant one of the largest quadrupeds it is more than six feet high and twelve long and is said to grow fifteen years and live a hundred it carries upon it nose a long strong horn which is sometimes double and with this it attacks and throwns down the elephant its horn is much sought after as many qualities are attributed to it as well as the blood and its very strong skin it feeds much as does the elephant and is found in the same countries   eugen are these the only extraordinary animal that are found in foreign countries   erast i am not acquainted with all however  can name you another that is the camel a very useful quadruped his common height is about seven feet and a half from the crown of his head which he carrie very high he has a very small head upon a very long neck and his body is about the bigness of an ox there are several kinds of camels those of arabia have a bunch upon their backs they are sometimes called dromedaries those of persia has two bunches it hair is short and soft and in the spring it falls off i three days of the hair are made pencil brushes for painting and some of the finest hats this animal i of little use but for burden and it will carry near   00 pounds in order to be laden it kneels down it will travel from twentyfive to thirty leagues a day and will go near nine days without drinking the camel eat but little and feeds upon herbs hay and the leaves o trees it lives commonly fity years they never bea it to make it go on the driver need only to whistle o sing i will next mention a few strange animals o another kind such as are amphibious like those fishes described who live by turns on land and in water   eugen if you please   erast the most formidable of these animals is the crocodile which is found on the borders of the nile and other great rivers there are some monstrous ones n the marshes adjoining the ganges in the east inies one was taken in the island of madagascar more han fifty feet long and much larger have been seen history relates that there was one on the borders of the iver megrada in africa a crocodile so monstrous that  defended itself a long time against the efforts of a whole army at that period cannon were unknown and they could only destroy it by knocking it down with great stones which they threw at the spine of its ack regulus sent its skin to rome and it was more han eighty feet long the crocodile has short feet and its body is covered with scales as hard as to resist on   eugen what a strange beast is the crocodile as mischievous as it is hideous   erast it will devour both men and animals when  seizes them it is very artful in obtaining its prey it ides itself and imitates a plaintive cry to attract pasengers hence it is we say affected distress is only crocodiles tears   eugen such monsters may commit great ravages does it multiply fast   erast no providence has wisely prevented this  has taken care to give being to two other animals qually amphibious who are mortal enemies to the crocodile one is the hippopotamus or seahorse this animal is as large as an ox with a head somehing resembling a horse its skin is an inch thick and  hard that a musket ball will scarce penetrate it  is one of the most furious of amphibious creatures and has terrible teeth with which it attacks the crocole the other is the ichneumon or the egyptian at which is something less then a co this little nimal is so mischievous that it attacks serpents dogs and even camels it devours young crocodiles and estroys their eggs which it finds in the sand it is on account of the essential service it renders in preventing too great an increase of crocodiles that the ancient people of egypt have ranked the ichneumon in the number of their gods but i must dwell no longer on animals we will finish with the beaver   eugen is that an amphibious animal   erast yes and is one of the most remarkable and at the same time one of the most sagacious animal in providing for its safety and convenience the beaver is truly an architect they are more industrious than either the be or the ant they build houses upon land opposite to the current of great rivers with stake and cement and that with an art and cleverness that i astonishing and yet they have no other instruments for this purpose then their teeth their feet and their tail their tail which is flat and large serves them for a trowel their teeth is their saw and with their feet they brea and soften the clay beavers work and live in societie with a wonderful order and police they procure the a supply of food at the approach of winter which the pass shut up in their cabins beaver hair makes fine hat   eugen what a prodigious number of animals the are of all kinds it is however to be lamented the there are so many dangerous ones i think the creat should not have given birth to them or at least shou have endued them with better qualities   erast it is presumed that at the creation the were endowed with a better disposition the lion a the tiger were about of first parents without givi them the least dread of their doing harm no anim would have been savage had adam and eve not sinne their revolt against god occasioned that of anim against men some of these animals trouble him  sects incommode him and all this is the unhappy sequence of sin however let it be remarked that an effect of the goodness of our supreme parent chievous animals increase much less than those wh are useful and that we have at all times means of pserving ourselves from the former   eugen you must permit me sir to make one flection more that which i admire most in the cond of the creator is the manner in which animals pertuate their species but i do not know how it is that corruption engenders worms   erast corruption does not engender them it is n old error which has deceived you nothing can spring from putrefaction if it did we should see everyday new animals which is not the case the creator n forming the world established a general and immutable law in all things and by this law every animal engenders or begets its like and will do so to the end of time thus all animals proceed from their father and mother this is sufficiently to be seen in the larger nimals if we observe occasionally swarms of insects ise from the midst of putrefaction it is as i have told ou that female insects of the same species have there deposited their eggs and that heat warming them ferentation has hatched them natural instinct teaches nsects to choose out those substances readiest to corrupt and of course best adapted to supply their young with ood as soon as hatched be assured this is the case there is none but uninformed persons who suppose the contrary but it is time to finish i see we are close upon the town   eugen we have in imagination made a very large ourney for in two days we have run through the heaens the earth and the waters in short through the hole course nature we have cast a rapid eye over he works of god and nearly in the order they were reated   erast and for what my dear eugenius do you suppose all these wonders were produced   eugen for you for me in short for man   erast you say right god having produced all out of nothing would next give being to a creature that should surpass the whole he could not create him reater or more noble than after his own image in oing this he employed only his will he made no use of his hands but took a little earth breathed into it the reath of life and man became a living foul a moment after he gave him a companion and these were the first air so done he made him king and master of all that he earth and sea produces   discourse vii on the constitution of this country the parliament nobility clergy and magistrates eugen i very much long sir that you should give me some account of the constitution of this country for i think not to be acquainted with the nature of the government under which we live is disgraceful to a man of any understanding   erast it certainly is and as you have a desire t know i will do my best to inform you  political writers of antiquity will allow but three regular forms of government democracy aristocracy and monarchy when the sovereign power is lodged in a assembly of all the free members of a community it is called a democracy when in a council composed of select members an aristocracy and when entrusted in the hand of a single person it is styled a monarchy   eugen what are the advantages of each kind o government   erast in a democratic state which is a republican government where the right of making laws rests in the people at large public virtue or uprightness of intention is most likely to be found but though public spirit and a degree of patriotism is generally to be found in the assemblies of the people such assemblies are of ten abusurd in their contrivance and weak in their execution  in aristocratic governments they being composed o intended so to be of the most experienced citizens an men of the greatest property more wisdom is to be expected but less honesty and less strength than in a monarchy for where the government is vested in a few men will be apt to consider their own interest  a monarchy of course is the most powerful of any being a conjunction of the powers that make laws an carry them into execution placed in the hands of the rince but in monarchies there is danger of the princes mploying those powers to impolitic or oppressive puroses thus have these three species of government their several perfections and imperfections   eugen of what kind then is the british constitions   erast it is a mixture of the whole has all the perctions of one without the imperfections of either r the executive power that is the power of carrying e laws into execution being lodged in a single person  instance in the king the laws have all the advanges of strength and dispatch to be found in the most absolute monarchy and the legislature or power of aking laws being entrusted to three distinct powers ally independent of each other namely king lords d commons the lords being an aristocratical assembly of persons selected for their piety their wisdom their valor and their property and the house of commons being a kind of democracy chosen by reprenting the people at large who are a body actuated by frent springs and attentive to different interests no convenience is to be dreaded from either each power ving a negative voice so as to contradict and oppose it pleases any improper or dangerous innovation or croachment of the other two  the executive power then in our constitution that is  power of enforcing the laws is vested in the king ne who is of course the supreme magistrate but the gislative power that of making these laws rests in the ng lords and commons which is the parliament  great britain   eugen must a law or an act of parliament then e the concurrence of king lords and commons   erast yes otherwise it would be no law thus n see that the commons are a check upon the lords d the lords upon the commons by the privilege each  of rejecting what the other has resolved whilst the g is a check upon both preserving thus the execue power from incroachment nay the two houses  parliament lords and commons have a privilege  calling the kings evil ministers and counselors to account and punishing them for any had conduct checking thus the executive power itself   eugen of what does the house of lords consist   erast of the spiritual and temporal lords of t realm the spiritual lords are the two archbishop and twentyfour bishops the temporal lords are  the dukes marquisses earls viscounts and baron whose number may be increased at the will of the kin sixteen of these lords or peers are chosen by the pee of scotland and sit as their representatives since the uni of the two kingdoms the other peers sit there virtue of their peerage   eugen when did the union take place   erast in the year   0  before this time a serate parliament was always held in scotland as ther in ireland for on the death of queen elizabeth in    james i then king of scotland became by success king of england and the two nations belonged to  same crown by an agreement therefore in   0  tween the parliament of england and that of scotla the two nations were united under one parliament  that of scotland was abolished so that the peers scotland elect sixteen lords to represent them in  parliament and the people of scotland elect fortymembers that sit in our house of commons to repre the commons of scotland ireland has a parliam of its own as scotland had before the union   eugen are there not more lords than sit in parment   erast none sit in our house of lords but the p of england the irish peers sit in their own coun but not here none of the scotch peers sit but the teen chosen ones and as to other lords the titles  merely titular being the sons and brothers only of pe   eugen of what does the house of commons sist   erast the commons of england consist of all men of property throughout the kingdom as have sears in the house of lords every one of whom  vote in parliament but as the people of england too numerous to assemble to do business in one p certain districts choose two representatives who  n parliament and vote for them these districts are he counties cities and borough towns the counties re represented by persons who have  00 pounds a year  land chosen by the freeholders that is men who possess a free estate of not less than forty shillings a year and those persons when elected are called knights of the ire or county and represent the landed property of the ingdom the cities and borough towns are reprented by persons possessing an estate not less than three undred pounds a year elected by the freemen of those ties and towns that is by the mercantile part of the people and those persons so elected are called burgesses o that the house of commons with the fortyfive memers elected by the people of scotland consists of five undred and fiftyeight the president or chairman of the parliament is called the speaker   eugen how often are these people chosen   erast once in seven years but the king has a rivilege to dissolve the parliament when he pleases and they never meet till he thinks proper to call them together   eugen suppose he was never to call them   erast then there could be no parliament in ormer times the nation has been without a parliament or many years but as the king now cannot establish ny tax or raise any money without the consent of the people or parliament and as money is always wanted for he purposes of government he finds it necessary to call he parliament together every year king charles the first made an attempt to raise money without the connt of the people or parliament and the consequence as that the people and the king went to war the king as taken prisoner by the parliaments army and beeaded this was in the year        eugen do the members of each house vote acording to their consciences   erast they ought to do so but it is a doubt hether they always do or not the king has such a umber of valuable appointments in his gift places of ofit and power which are generally given to the memers of both houses of parliament and which he can ke away again at his pleasure that he generally commands a majority of votes in both houses and it is th influence of the crown that makes the people disstisfied for when the king can influence the member of the house of commons he can induce them to funish him with any sums of money he pleases be it ev so opposite to the inclinations of the people they reprsent and this has too often been done and is call venality   eugen and have the people no redress   erast none but that of turning out the member who voted so contrary to their wishes at the ne new parliament   eugen and do they   erast very seldom for these members profit  their situation and find it their interest to bribe the people to elect them again some gentlemen will spe from  0000 pounds to  0000 pounds to gain a seat  parliament and this money goes among the electo indeed the members of the house of commons lose the seat there upon taking a place or office under govement but the influence of money is such that they  themselves rechosen   eugen but there should be a law to punish th who bribe the electors   erast so there is but they generally find mea to evade that law   eugen i have heard of torys and whigs w are they   erast by tory is understood the party in fav of the king and by whig that in favor of the peo two names of reproach first given in the last century   eugen do not judges sit in the house of peers   erast yes but they have no vote they sit th only to give their advice in matters of law when t advice is asked for   eugen what are their salaries   erast the chief justice of the kings bench  000 pounds a year the chief justice of the com pleas   00 pounds the chief baron of the exche   00 pounds and the puisne or under judges  pounds a year each  ev when formerly there was no other religion in the country   erast because they experienced the inconveniences and became sensible of the absurdities of this religion until the year      when henry viii shook off the popes power over the people of this kingdom the established religion in great britain and ireland was the romish but the people examining into the nature of it discovering its many errors and finding the king as ready as they were to introduce the protestant religion which had at this time gained a footing in germany the parliament cooperated with him in reforming the church and altering the religion of the country this event is called the reformation   eugen why was the reformed religion called the protestant   erast because at the diet or assembly of the german states at spires in    0 several protested against a decree of the diet to support the doctrines of the church of rome   eugen it does not appear that all the people of england are of the same opinion for there are many dissenters from the church of england   erast there are and these are presbyterians anabaptists quakers and methodists   eugen and what distinction is there between them   erast to enter into all the distinctions would take up a great deal of time the great ones are that the presbyterian doctrine excludes episcopacy that is admits of no bishops nor any form of prayer and is the established religion of scotland anabaptists will not admit of infant baptism but baptize their followers when at full age quakers admit of no preachers but such as think themselves inspired they are called quakers from their affecting to quake when the spirit a suppoted to give them utterance at other times they are silent at their meetings and as to the methodists they pretend to profess purer doctrines than those of the church of england but they are all protestants notwithstanding and deny the authority of the pope and of e church of rome   eugen there is no variety of religion in roman catholic countries why is there here   erast because those states will not suffer it but it is one of the blessing of our constitution to be indulged in a liberty of conscience all religions are allowed here even the roman catholic in private chapels and under certain restrictions and this general indulgence is called toleration from their being here tolerated but we are wandering from the subject we were upon that of the duty and privileges of the king of england his duty i told you his privileges are as follow  the king is the chief and sole magistrate of the nation can of his own authority reject any act of parliament presented to him for signing and in such cases it never passes into a law he can make any treaty with foreign powers create any peers and pardon any offense except where the constitution interferes the king can also make war and peace without the consent of his parliament but though he can declare war he cannot carry it on without money and this money he cannot get without the peoples consent this therefore obliges him never to make war but with the approbation of parliament he has the appointment of ambassadors to foreign courts who represent the king that sends them and protect their countrymen when occasion requires it  the king is considered as the head of the church army and the navy and as such has the appointmen of all the bishops and officers he is also considered as the fountain of honor and of course confers all titles   eugen how is the king ans his family supported has he any estates of his own   erast as elector of hanover he has a prett considerable revenue but not sufficient to support hi and his dignity as king of england there are some estates in this country that belong to him as king b his chief support is from the people of whom he  obliged when he comes to the crown to ask for a bcoming maintenance the parliament are always read to support his dignity for the honor of the crown an at this time they allow him annually  00000 pounds a year out of which he pays all the state officers the judges and all the expenses of his family and whenever any of his children arrive at manhood parliament always makes a separate provision for them the prince of wales has  0000 pounds a year   eugen the taxes i presume are appropriated to the expenses of government and to pay the interest of the national debt   erast they are   eugen can you give me a general account of the taxes   erast the first great tax is a land tax by which gentlemen who have estates pay four shillings in the pound or  00 pounds out of every  00 pounds this with the tax upon malt raises about  000000 pounds  there is next a tax on the exportation and importation of merchandise this is conducted by the commissioners of the customs  then there is an excise duty that is a tax on beer cider perry spirits silks linens starch hairpowder carriages things sold by auction traveling in post chaises men servants coffee tea chocolate wines paper vinegar glass hops candles soap leather malt and a variety of other articles these are under the control of the commissioners of excise  another tax is four shillings and twopence on every bushel of salt  another are the stamp duties under the commissioners of the stamp office this is a tax on writings relative to lawsuits and agreements of every kind upon almanacks newspapers advertisements pamphlets cards and dice receipts and bills of exchange  there are others upon houses and windows hackney coaches and chairs within the bills of mortality leacies and one shilling in the pound out of all salaries and perquisites of offices and pensions paid by the crown   eugen what do you mean by the bills of morlity   erast these are accounts or registers kept by the clerks of every parish within the cities and suburbs of london and westminster specifying the numbers born married and buried annually of course by within the bills i mean within the districts where these registers are kept   eugen a very useful institution pray what do the taxes amount to in the whole   erast to upwards of ten millions of pounds annually   eugen what an enormous sum   erast having now given you an account of the chief magistrate shall i make you acquainted with such as are below him   eugen if you please   erast the sheriff of the county then is the first his office is that of chief jailer and he has the custody of all criminals and delinquents in the district within his command though i call him chief jailer he is by virtue of his office for the time being the first man in the county and ranks before every nobleman therein there is one presiding over every county and is appointed by the king out of the gentlemen resident in that county the county prison and the keeper of that prison are under his control and it is his duty to execute the sentence of the law upon all criminals himself or to find one to do it for him though that sentence extend even to death most gentlemen aspire to the office of sheriff though it is attended with the expense of   or  00 pounds for the year they serve there are two sheriffs for the city of london chosen by the city  the next officer to the sheriff is the coroner every county has more than one some have four some six according to the extend of the county he is chosen by the freeholders and his office is for life though he may be removed for misconduct his duty is to enquire into the death of such as are killed die suddenly or in prison he has fees upon the occasion so that his place is a place of emolument  the next order of subordinate magistrates are justices of the peace the chief of whom is the custos retulorum or the keeper of the county records   eugen can any one be a justice of peace   erast no hemust have a property of  00 pounds a year to qualify him and is appointed by the lord chancellor at the recommendation of the lord lieutenant of the county   eugen what is the lord lieutenant   erast he is generally some man of rank in the county and is appointed by the king during the pleasure of the crown   eugen what is his office   erast he acts under the king in a military capacity besides appointing the magistrates for the county he appoints all the officers in the county militia and is himself the colonel and in case of any invasion by a foreign enemy would take the military command of the county this is held to be a very honorable employ and is much coveted by men of the first rank   eugen you have frequently mentioned rank is it of any use to a man   erast of great use precedence in rank is more attended to by great people then you are aware of precedence generally takes place in the following order princes archbishops dukes marquisses earls viscounts bishops barons knights of the garter privy counselors judges baronets knights of the bath knights doctors esquires and gentlemen the nobility are very particular to preserve their rank on all public occasions and you will find a title respected every where besides if there are any offices of profit in government the church the army or the navy the nobility can procure them for themselves or their relations in preference to other people and all the departments about the king are commonly filled with them and add to this they have a number of privileges a peer like a member in the house of commons cannot be arrested and thrown into prison for debt they have ll their post letters free of expense and can frank or free the letters of others a peer if guilty of a criminal act is tried always by the house of lords and can command an audience of the king at any time that  can see him and speak to him without fearing to be refused admittance and they as well as clergymen receiving the benefit of clergy are not burnt in the hand   eugen i do not comprehend what you mean by benefit of clergy   erast what is called benefit of clergy had its rise in the pious reverence of christian princes for the church in its infant state being an institution to exempt the clergy from being criminally proceeded against by secular or lay judges popish exclesiastics soon made an ill use of this for they afterward claimed this indulgence not only for themselves but for all attendants upon the church whether they were clergymen or not and in length of time this exemption grew general and all who could read had the same indulgence reading being a great mark of learning in those days of ignorance till an act of parliament of henry vii made a distinction between laymen and clergymen subjecting the former for certain crimes deserving death to be burnt with a hot iron on the left thumb and denying them this privilege a second time and they are now not even required to read but the indulgence is generally granted to all persons both men and women clergymen however if found guilty of such offenses as claim this benefit of clergy are not burnt in the hand but immediately discharged and this as often as they offend whereas others suffer death for the second offense and as to peers when found guilty they are discharged without burning in the hand but if condemned for the same offense of second time will like other laymen suffer death   eugen how do persons procure title   erast by interest that is to say by their influence with the king or the ministers of state and sometimes by services which they have done the state   eugen of what kind is this influence   erast many gentlemen from their extensive property can command the votes of freeholders and freemen of towns which send members to parliament of course they can appoint such members and these members will naturally give their vote as the person shall direct to whom they owe their seat in the house of commons the king therefore will often bestow a title upon the gentleman who appoints those members in order to obtain  votes but titles are frequently given for services done to the state for example to great statesmen generals admirals and men learned in the law the chancellor is always made a peer which generally adds two or three to the house of lords every reign and sometimes the judges are made peers   eugen i do not at all wonder then that men of great fortune are ambiious to be created peers if so much respect is due to their rank are there any more public offices besides those you have named   erast yes but the next are of lower order i think the next is the constable of which there are two degrees high and petty high constables are appointed by the bench of justices at the quarterly sessions of the peace which are held quarterly at the principal town in the county for the administration of justice in matters of small concern they preside over a district called a hundred consisting of several parishes petty constables are inferior officers in every town and parish selected by the high constables from the parishioners and are subordinate to the high constables they are appointed by two justices to serve one year the duty of a constable is to keep good order in the parish and for this purpose he can take up disorderly persons confine them and carry them before a magistrate this office is not held very reputable and frequently those that are appointed for all must serve in their turn will pay a fine or sum of money to be excused serving in this case another takes the office  the next public officers are the surveyors of the highway   eugen what are these   erast every parish is bound to keep the high roads through it in repair except the turnpike roads and surveyors are appointed to see this business properly done there are generally two in every parish appointed out of the substantial inhabitants by two neighboring justices of the peace  the last officers i shall now mention are the overers of the poor till the reign of henry viii the poor subsisted throughout england upon private charity but under queen elizabeth overseers in every parish were appointed from substantial housekeepers yearly in easter week by two neighboring justices their duty is to raise money in the parish by collecting from every one in proportion to the rent of the house lives in for the relief of their own poor who are not able to work and to provide work for such as are able and cannot get employ   eugen now you mention poor sir i could wish to know what gypsies are   erast gipsy is a corruption of egyptian these are a peculiar race of people supposed to come originally from egypt and to be endowed with the gift of prophecy they made their appearance first in germany about      but have been since banished from all parts of europe what are called gypsies now are a set of vagabond poor who live in the open air wandering about in companies from one part of the country to another pretending to tell silly people their fortunes and subsisting wholly upon plunder they are liable by our laws to be taken up and if they have cheated any one of money to be hanged   eugen you have omitted to speak of the churchwardens   erast i shall speak of them after i have mentioned the clergy for churchwardens are officers of the church   eugen i beg your pardon are you going to speak of the clergy now   erast i am the people are divided into two classes the clergy and the laity the clergy being an order of men set apart to attend the service of god have certain privileges allowed them among the rest one is not to be liable to serve temporal ofices as sheriff constable overseer and the like but then they have certain disabilities on account of their spiritual avocations they are incapable of sitting in the house of commons nor can any rector or vicar take any lands to farm or follow any way of business   eugen some of the clergy do hold farms not withstanding   erast they are allowed to hold sufficient land to maintain their families and under this pretense will often buy and sell like other farmers but they are liable to pay ten pounds a month to the king for so doing   eugen are there not several ranks of clergymen   erast several archbishops bishops deans prebendaries archdeacons parsons vicars and curates   eugen shall i trouble you to describe them   erast england is divided into two provinces over each of which presides an archbishop three of the bishoprics durham chester and carlisle are subject to the bishop of york and the other twentyone to the archbishop of canterbury an archbishop is the head of the clergy in his whole province and governs the bishops as well as the inferior clergy at the command of the king he calls the bishops and clergy of his province to meet in convocation all the bishops have some livings more or less to give away among the clergy and when a clergyman of any parish dies of which the church is in the git of the bishop if the bishop does not dispose of it in six months the archbishop has the giving of it away he can grant a license to a clergyman that is a master of arts in one of our universities to hold two livings and he can grant special licenses to marry at any place or at any time he has also the privilege of conferring a doctors or other degree in the same manner as do the universities   eugen what cannot people be married when and where they please   erast not without the bishops license which costs ten pounds the laws obliges people to be married at their own parish church and between eight and twelve in the morning   eugen you mentioned his calling the clergy to convocation what is that   erast the convocation is a parliament in miniature the upper house consisting of the bishops represents the house of lords in which the archbishop of canterbury presides as king and with royal state the lower house is composed of representatives chosen by the clergy rectors and vicars in the several archdeaconries and by the prebendaries of the several cathedrals resembling the house of commons with its knights and burgesses   eugen what business do they do and how often do they meet   erast they meet as often as the parliament does but meet only to disperse again for they have no sooner chosen their prolocutor or chairman than the king prorogues them or prevents their continuance they formerly settled the business of the church but being found to enter into matters that did not concern them the king has never suffered them to do any business since the year      the form is still preferved as being part of the constitution of this country but to return  a bishop as well as an archbishop besides the power of ordaining clergymen and other holy ordinances has authority to inspect the manners of the laity as well as of the clergy and punish delinquents by ecclesiastical censures to this end they hold courts of civil law   eugen how are bishops appointed and in what manner do their revenues arise   erast bishops and archbishops are chosen by the chapter of their cathedrals that is by the dean and prebendaries belonging to the cathedral but they are obliged to choose such persons as the kind recommends their revenues arise from the great tithes of several vicarages in their gift and from lands appropriated to the bishopric   eugen what are these tithes   eugen tithes are the tenth part of the produce of the lands lying in each parish which time out of mind have been the property of the rector or parson of the parish but for the maintenance of the bishops several of these rectories have been converted into vicarages that is the tithes have been divided and the great tithes as corn hay and such things as are most valuable have been appropriated to the use of the bishops and the smaller tithes as milk fruit etc have been settled on the clergymen who served the church and whom the bishop appoints such clergymen are called vicars whereas such as have all the tithes of a parish both great and small are called rectors or parson rectors also have generally some land annexed to their houses the vicars little or none of course rectories are of great annual value from forty pounds a year to  000 hundred pounds a year and often not so much as twenty pounds   eugen you tell me that the great tithes of a parish are the property of the rector how is it then that some have fallen into lay hands for i have a relation who gives away the living to a clergyman but who receives the great tithes himself   erast this originated among the friars before the reformation when there were societies of roman catholic clergymen living together in one house called convents as many now do in france and spain and other countries in the same manner as i have told you the fellows live together in the several colleges in our universities by consent of the king they begged and bought all the church livings within their reach appropriating the tithes to the use of themselves and giving a priest some small stipend or the small tithes for serving the church who was thence called a vicar which means a substitute now at the reformation when the popish religion was abolished the monaseries were dissolved or broken up and these appropriations or great tithes vested in the king who afterward granted them to private persons not clergymen who have from time to time sold them or disposed of them to whom they thought proper these appropriations from being improperly in the hands of laymen are called impropriations crown lands and obey lands were ever exempt from paying tithes ch lands therefore to this day continue tithefree   eugen what are first fruits and tenths   erast the first fruits of living were the whole ofits of the first year according to a rate settled in     and originally paid to the pope the tenths were a tenth part of the annual income of each living  the same valuation at the reformation the y were nexed to the crown and that valuation made by which the clergy are now rated but by the bounty of queen ann all livings under fifty pounds a year are discharged of these payments and what others pay is vested in trustees for ever as a perpetual fund for the augmentation of poor livings   eugen i should like to know how it happened that several noblemen and gentlemen have one or more livings in their gift   erast i will explain this by and by to do it now would be breaking in upon the order in which i proposed to describe to you the several officers of the church   eugen i will interrupt you no more   erast before either rectors or vicars i should have mentioned a dean and chapter the dean with the chapter of the cathedral church that is the canons or prebendaries which are clergymen that attend the service of the cathedral are the bishops counsel to assist him with advice in matters of religion or the temporal concerns of his bishopric most of the deans are appointed by the king and some few by the bishop of the diocese it is the same with the prebendaries some of whom are nominated by the king and others by the bishops  the next person to be mentioned is the archdeacon this is also a clerical officer is subordinate to the bishop of the diocese and is appointed by the bishop but has a kind of episcopal authority independent of him it is the province and duty of a bishop to hold a visitation in the several parts of his diocese that is to go round his bishopric once in three years to confirm the children inspect the manners of the clergy so that the churches are kept in order and that every religious instruction is properly attended this i say th bishop does once in three yars but the archdeaco does it every year except the year the bishop attend the archdeacon has also a court for trying spiritu offenses and punishing them with spiritual censures there are one or more archdeacons in every bishop according to the extent of it  rectors and vicars i have mentioned the cu is an officating minister assisting the rector or vic for which be is paid a stipend of about fifty pounds year   eugen that is a small salary considering the great incomes of some livings what do the revenues of bishops and deans generally amount to   erast the archbishopric of canterbury is  0000 pounds a year that of york  000 pounds and the several bishops including livings they sometimes hold have from  000 pounds to  000 pounds deaneries are from about   00 pounds a year to about  00 pounds and prebends from about  00 pounds a year to  0 pounds so much then for the clergy i have now only to explain the inferior offices of the church viz churchwardens parish clerks and sextons  there are generally two churchwardens chosen for every parish one by the inhabitants and one by the rector or vicar these are the guardians of the church and the representatives of the body of parishioners their duty is to keep the church in repair and collect money from the parishioners in proper proportions for that purpose and they with the overseers have also the management of the poor  parish clerks are generally appointed by the rector or vicar and are sworn into their office by the archdeacon their duty is to attend the minister in the offices of the church   eugen i have been told that parish clerks are often clergymen   erast in parishes where the office of clerk is worth a clergymans notice it is sometimes given to persons in holy orders but they never officiate as clerk but appoint a deputy to do the duty  sextons are persons that toll the bell dig the graves and keep the churches clean and quite during divine service   eugen now sir you have gone through the whole permit me to remind you of giving me an account how the gift of livings fell into lay hands when i think they should be in the disposal of the bishop   erast though laymen may be the patrons of livings that is have the gift of the church yet the bishop has the examination of the persons appointed whether he has sufficient learning and whether he be  man of good character or not if he is found to be an improper person the bishop can reject him and patrons must nominate another but now for an answer to your question  to make you rightly understand the nature of patronage i must first acquaint you with the origin of manors   eugen i am all attention   erast manors are as ancient as the saxon constitution which was general in this country before the year  0   when it was conquered by king william i a manor consisted of a certain district or extent of land the extent of one or more parishes or perhaps but part of one the usual residence of the owner and some part of which he kept nihis hands for the use of his family the rest was distributed to tenants who for the use of the land consented to do whatever the lord of the manor commanded him so that they sometimes went out to war with him and fought for him sometimes they cultivated the land he kept in his own hands and did other services which he required of him this was the state of the scodal system so much spoken of in history men were then at the will of their lord since that time certain indulgencies of lords of manors certain constructions of law and certain encroachments of the tenants have made some alteration in this and though such tenants still hold their lands or estates at the will of the lord yet it is such a will as is agreeable to the custom of the manor which customs are preserved in the courtroll of the manor and kept by the stewards and those tenants who have nothing to show for their estates but admissions in consequence of such customs witnessed by copies of entries in their possession made by the stewards are called tenants by copy of courtroll and their estate is thence called a copyhold for such estates they pay a small annual sum by way of acknowledgement perhaps a few shillings called quirent and the lord when they die takes generally the best beast such tenant possessed this beast is called a heriot lords of manors have it in their power to release such estates from heriots and quitrent in which case the estate is called a freehold and the owner freeholder and these are the people who elect the knight of the shire to serve in parliament provided each mans freehold is not less than forty shillings a year  now then this understood you will comprehend the nature of patronage great part of these manors as now consisted of waste ground and as christianity spread the lords of these manors began to build churches on their wastes for the accommodation of their tenants and obliged those tenants to appropriate their tithes to the support of one officiating minister which before were distributed among all the clergy in the diocese and this tract or extent of land the tithes of which were so appropriated was called a parish and because they built the church they were allowed to nominate a minister subject to his examination by the bishop this right of nomination is called an advowson and is saleable like an estate provided the rector or vicar is first appointed   eugen you have given me such a clear account of every thing you have told me that i trust i shall remember it   erast we will then finish for the present lest your memory should be too much burdened our next subject shall be upon the army   discourse ix on the army navy and militia eugen i think sir our discourse this day is to be upon the army   erast it is and you shall be told every thing i know upon the subject the profession of arms comprehends all those who engage to serve their king and ountry in war with honor and sidelity the king has he nomination of all the officers and gives them pay in roportion to the rank each one holds in the service from the common soldier to the general this pay is mething increased in time of war by some advantages he officers have during their encampment  the army is divided into three branches the cavalry infantry and artillery for i shall say nothing of the navy now having mentioned that when i was speaking of the sea   eugen will you do me favor to describe each in its turn   erast by the cavalry is understood the horse of which there are two troops of horse guards of life guards so called because they attend upon the king only and defend his life two troops of horse grenadier guards one regiment of horse guards four regiments of horse three regiments of dragoon guards and eighteen regiments of dragoons in all about twentysix regiments or about   000 men   eugen what officers are there belonging to a regiment of horse   erast a colonel a lieutenant colonel a major eight or ten captains and as many lieutenants and cornets an adjutant a quartermaster a chaplain and a surgeon with kettle drummer trumpeter sergeant and corporals   eugen what is the pay of the cavalry   erast the horse guards have better pay than the dragoons a colonel of dragoons has  l   s per day a lieutenant colonel  l  s  d a major  l0s  d each captain of a troop   s  d a lieutenant  s a cornet  s the adjutant  s surgeon  s and the chaplain  s  d the drummer  s  d the trumpeter  s a sergeant  s  d a corporal  s  d and each private man  s  d the colonel has the clothing of his regiment for which he is allowed sufficient to clean   or  00 pounds a year after paying for the clothes and a captain of a troop has also some perquisites the colonel of the two troops of lifeguards attend upon the king at court on court days and their regiments are not worth less to each all things considered than  000l pounds a year a regiment of dragoons is considered worth   00 pounds a year and a regiment  foot  000 pounds a year in time of war and about  00 pounds in time of peace   eugen and why this   erast because a regiment in time of war consists of  000 men and in time of peace of not above half the number of course if a colonel gets  00 pounds a year by clothing  000 men he can get but half the money by clothing  00   eugen how many regiments of foot are there   erast sometimes more and sometimes less in peace there is about seventytwo regiments in war about   0 besides three regiments of foot guards that are always a kept up in war or peace each regiment consisting of  000 men so that in war reckoning   0 regiments of  000 men each is   0000 and  000 guards but in time of peace the   0 regiments are reduced to about seventytwo of  00 each that is about   000 men   eugen how are the regiments divided   erast into ten companies each each company has a captain a lieutenant and an ensign and over the whole there is a colonel a lieutenant colonel and a major a company of artillery has four lieutenants   eugen have the infantry no chaplain   erast yes each regiment has a chaplain an adjutant a surgeon and a surgeons mate besides sergeants and corporals   eugen what is the pay of the foot   erast the foot guards have better pay than arching regiments they continue in london which  a more expensive place than the country where other egiments are quartered and where owing to being artered or lodged at public houses the officers can e cheaper besides the uniform or clothes of the ofcers of the foot guards is more expensive than those f marching regiments the officers of the foot guards ave also better or more rank than officers of other rements an ensign of the guards ranks or is upon an uality with a lieutenant of a marching regiment a eutenant of the guards ranks as a captain and a aptain of the guards as a lieutenant colonel and is lled colonel now with respect to their pay  the colonel of a marching regiment has  l  s per y the lieutenant colonel   s the major   s each the captains  0s a lieutenant  s  d an ensign  s  d the adjutant  s the quartermaster  s  d the surgeon  s and  d a month out of each mans pay the surgeons mate  s  d and the chaplain  s  d a sergeant  s  d a corporal  s and each private man  d   eugen it is very little pay how do they contrive to live upon it   erast it is with difficulty indeed the officers seldom do they have generally small fortunes of their own the army is a profession of honor rather than of profit and so great is the eagerness of young men to get into it that commissions are oftener purchased than given away   0 pounds is the price given for an ensigncy and the pay is not more than about fifty pounds a year in time of peace when regiments are quartered or settled in a country place an ensign can make shift to live upon his pay the inns upon the roads are obliged to give him a bed and three good meals a day for one shilling in which case he has two shillings and sixpence left for clothes and other things and as to the common soldiers the public houses are obliged by act of parliament to give them a lodging small beer fire and utensils to dress their food with salt pepper and vinegar for nothing or to find them in victuals for fourpence a day   eugen i have heard say that the army is the best school in the world for young men why is it so reckoned   erast because they enter very early into it and are brought up with high notions of honor bravery and politeness to each other there is such a discipline in the army that no officer dare contradict dispute or disobey the orders of a superior officer though that officer shall perhaps be only an older captain or an older ensign on pain of being tried by his brother officers for disobedience of orders and of being punished broke and disgraced if found guilty a lad that is undutiful to his parents or masters will be there soon taught subordination and obedience he will learn to live upon sixpence a day to bear heat and cold and fatigue and never to commit a dishonorable action   eugen what are the field officers of a regiment   erast the colonel lieutenant colonel and the major who take a particular command when in the field of battle   eugen is there no higher rank in the army than a colonel   erast yes brigadiergenerals majorgenerals lieutenantgenerals generals and field marshals and last of all commanders in chief who command the whole army whereas other generals in proportion to their rank command only a branch of the army in the day of battle   eugen what is the pay fo these generals   erast they have no pay but when employed admirals are always in pay but generals not when they are paid their pay is in proportion to their rank from two pounds a day to ten pounds which is the pay of the commanders in chief   eugen what is the office of the adjutant and the quartermaster   erast the adjutants business in to assist the major to deliver his orders and to regulate the regimental accounts that of the quartermaster to procure proper accommodations for the men in quarters and camp and to keep every thing in order these officers in each regiment with the chaplain and surgeon are appointed by the colonel as are the sergeants and corporals by the captains   eugen what are the grenadiers   erast they form one company of every regiment that march at the head of that regiment they are the allest bestmade men picked out of the whole and wear ong caps on purpose to make them appear taller in orer to give the regiment a noble appearance   eugen is a soldier when enlisted obliged to serve or life   erast he is obliged to serve twenty years unless e be disabled or can procure his discharge before it  in the option of his colonel who if he has behaved ell will discharge him for eight or ten guineas in order  procure another in his room or will give him his disarge for nothing   eugen is an officer ever promoted in the army by seniority   erast sometimes particularly if he is abroad in service in time of war if a lieutenant dies or is killed the eldest ensign of the same regiment will come in youngest lieutenant if a captain dies or is killed the eldest lieutenant will now and then succeed but this succession will not often take place in officers of higher rank than captains it will require interest and recommendation as for great attention to duty some gallant act of bravery or the like when an officer once ges the rank of colonel his rank goes on and no colonel is put over his head all the colonels of the same standing are made majorsgenerals together and all majorgenerals of the same standing lieutenantgenerals a the same time but it does not follow that because a man is a general he is to be employed as such the king singles out for a command such as he thinks are men of the best abilities and heroism   eugen i have heard of volunteers what are these   erast in time of war a young gentleman who perhaps cannot get a ensigcy for asking for and has    0 pounds to purchase one will request the colone of a regiment in service to take him as a volunteer  accepted he acts in the station of a private soldier at  own expense without pay but yet associates with the officers and such volunteer will have the first ensigncy in the regiment that drops given to him as a reward for his alacrity and readiness to serve his country   eugen have there not been instances of privat soldiers obtaining in course of time great rank in the army   erast there have been some few instances of the kind the late generals bland and salter were one common soldiers an industrious man in the guard may by the favor of his colonel soon be appointed sergeant it is then his dty to teach the men their erene and if they are clever and expert at this wh new regiments are raised they generally give one  two of such men commissions in each of those n raised regiments in order to exercise the men and  they are properly disciplined when the   th rement was raised in the last war there were seven sergeants taken from the guards and made lieutenants of that regiment though they had never been ensigns a sergeant of the guards being almost considered upon an equality of rank with an ensign of a marching regiment but this was a singular circumstance when once they are in commission it is easy to see that in time of action something may happen to forward their promotion   eugen is there any provision for disabled soldiers as there is for disabled seamen   erast when a soldier has served twenty years he is entitled to be an outpensioner of chelsea hospital for which he receives about seven pounds a year and is at liberty to set up his trade in any town in the kingdom which no man else can unless he be a freeman of those towns and if he is unable by wounds to get his living and is desirous of being taken into the hospital wholly he will be received lodged clothed and maintained for the rest of his life but sometimes in time of war when soldiers are wanted to go abroad they will select the most able of the outpensioners to serve in forts and garrisons within the kingdom indeed the garrisons of great britain are chiefly manned with invalids of which there are twentysix companies and officers who have lost a leg or an arm in the service are generally removed to them where they live comfortably the remainder of their days   eugen is there no provision for their widows if they are killed in battle   erast none the widows of officers have pensions after their death whether they are killed in battle or not a colonels widow has  0l a year a majors  0l a lieutenantcolonels   l a majors  0l a captains   l a lieutenants  0l an ensigns   l and a chaplains and surgeons  0l each   eugen what becomes of the officers and men of the reduced regiments   erast the men are disbanded that is discharged and the officers have half pay for their lives   eugen now sir will you explain to me the arery   erast the artillery is employed in firing of cannon and throwing of bombs   eugen i know what a cannon is but do not rightly understand the nature of a bomb   erast a bomb is an iron shell hollow within filled with combustible matter with a fuse or artificial fire communicating with the contents of the shell and which takes fire without when shot out of a mortar or piece something resembling a cannon it is designed to be shot into towns and forts and is so contrived that the fue which burns all the way it goes shall set fire to the contents of the bomb as soon as it falls to the ground and burst it into a thousand pieces which will destroy and fire every thing within its reach the soldiers generally see them as they fly in the air and avoid them when they can they are thrown into forts like a cannon ball by the force of gunpowder   eugen how many regiments of artillery are there   erast only one which consists of four batallions whose province it is to work mortars great guns or cannons spring mines throw bridges over rivers and other such things   eugen i do not comprehend what you mean by springing of mines   erast a mine is a subterraneous passage dug under the wall or rampart of a fortified town designed to be blown up with gunpowder when the enemy is passing over it   eugen is there any difference between the artillery and the engineers   erast the corpse of engineers is a part of the artillery their business is to contrive attacks at sieges and defend towns when besieged this corpse has one colonel two lieutenantscolonels four majors twentyfour captains and thirtyeight lieutenants   eugen how many men does a batallion consist of   erast from five hundred to eight hundred   eugen how many forts are there in great britain   erast thirtyfour or thirtyfive each of which has a governor and lieutenant governor besides other officers and some artillery the pay of the governors is from   00 pounds a year to  00 pounds and  the lieutenant governor from  00 pounds to  00l all these offices are in the gift of the king   eugen does the king dispose of them himself   erast very seldom they are given away as are the bishoprics generally by the kings ministers to their families or to those whom they wish to oblige   eugen how many ministers has the king   erast about eight or nine and these generally consist of such of the privy council as bear the great offices of state the first lord of the treasury the lord chancellor the lord president of the council the first lord of the admiralty the chancellor of the exchequer the secretary of war the commander in chief of the army when there is one and the two secretaries of state but the first lord of the treasury is the ostensible minister and if these gentlemen should advise the king to any wrong measure they are liable to be called to an account for it by the parliament which is called impeaching them and to be punished even to the loss of life have you any more questions to ask   eugen oh yes a great many i want among other things to know what a siege is and the nature of it   erast it is in sieges that the artillery are chiefly mployed when a fort of fortified town that is a own round which thick walls are built and great ditches ug to defend it against the approach of an enemy then such a strong place is attacked it is said to be esieged and the business of the besiegers is to get into and take possession of such fort or town   eugen is a fort and a fortified town the same thing   erast no a fort is merely a place walled and ditched und like a fortified town for the shelter and security of a mber of soldiers and like that is called a garrison a all number of soldiers from such a place can occasionally ly or go out and annoy the enemy and retire within the  again and be safe it is therefore i say the business of e besiegers to drive this garrison out and take possession  the place for this purpose artillery are employed  both sides that is bombs are thrown and cannon d those from the besiegers to knock down the walls  destroy the fort those from the besieged to drive away the enemy by firing on them from the walls if the besiegers can make a breach in any part of the walls they will rush in and take the fort by force this is called storming it if they cannot do this they will cut off all communication with the fort either by sea or land by carefully watching that no persons shall go out of it nor any provisions ammunition or other assistance be taken in and by this means in a length of time they will starve them out and oblige them to surrender for when their provisions or ammunition is gone they can hold out no longer   eugen and are things always carried to such extremities   erast no the besieged generally surrender if overpowered before things are brought to the utmost extremity for the general of the besiegers always sends to the commanding officer of the fort and tells him that if he does not surrender he will show to garrison no quarter that is if he is obliged to get possession by force he will put every man to death should they hold out to the last they lie wholly at the mercy of their enemy if the besieged are driven off or think proper to desist from their enterprise they are said to raise the siege   eugen how do they send to each other when all communication is cut off   erast they will sometimes as the romans did shoot a letter upon the point of an arrow from one to the other or a party will advance from the chief body of the enemy with a flag which is called a flag of truce this is generally seen by the other party and is known to be the signal for a parley or conference   eugen who sir were the romans   erast they were a warlike people that inhabited italy from about  00 years before christ to about     after christ that is for about the space of  00 years who carried their conquests into most parts of europe asia and africa and became masters of all the know parts of the world but owing to too great an extent o empire they were not able to keep their subjects i subjection who as they grew more powerful se up kings of their own in the different parts of europe this gave rise to the present kingdoms and the roman empire sunk away and was lost in the establishment of other states   eugen in mentioning the soldiery you have not once named the militia   erast the militia are a distinct body of men though they are disciplined like the army and cooperate with them in time of war   eugen how are they raised   erast every county is obliged to raise a certain number out of the inhabitants of that county and the men so raised are trained to arms and serve three years when others are drawn by lot in their room   eugen are they under arms all these three years   erast no only in time of war at which time they are clothed and paid like other soldiers and are under the same discipline but in time of peace they re called out for one month at whitsuntide and are taught their exercise or the use of arms and during the month only that they are so out they are paid   eugen how are they chosen   erast each parish chooses yearly by lot a proporionable number of their inhabitants perhaps three or our or more sufficient to make up the number their ounty is to furnish if any of these inhabitants object o serve by paying five or six pounds a substitute may e found to serve the three years for them   eugen how are the officers chosen   erast they are appointed by the lord lieutenant  the county out of the gentlemen of the county the lord lieutenant being always the colonel of the ounty militia   eugen and are they obliged to serve   erast as the militia are never sent out of the ngdom gentlemen are veryeager for these appointments so that none are chosen but such as have a tain independent property which is called a qualition   eugen what are the necessary qualifications   erast lieutenant colonels must have an estate of  00 unds a year the majors and captains  00 pounds lieutenant  0 pounds and ensigns  0 pounds one half of which property must be in the county they are chosen for   eugen is there any provision for a wounded militia man   erast they are like other soldiers entitled to the benefit of chelsea hospital and have other privileges like them   eugen how many men do the several counties raise   erast england and wales together furnish  0  0 private men   eugen when all the army are together they must make a vast body   erast certainly not less in time of war reckoning the cavalry infantry militia marines and artillery than about    000 besides   0000 seamen so that without officers the army and navy may be reckoned in war to amount to above  00000 men a vast number for so small a territory as great britain to find and support   eugen does not ireland assist upon this occasion   erast yes but in the last war they raised among themselves for the defense of their own country  0000 volunteers and every man was well disciplined and bore his own expenses without calling upon the state for any assistance which added to the number of the army reckoned before makes   0000 men   eugen a vast number indeed   erast such a number as dispelled all fear of being attacked in any quarter for the success of a battle generally depends upon numbers few generals caring to risk an engagement if their army is not pretty near upon an equality with the enemy in point of number   eugen how many ships for war have we   erast we had last war in commission small and great about   0 on which there are on board nea   000 guns or cannon   eugen are these all fighting ships   erast when i say   0 i include  0  ships of it line which are ships carrying more guns than  0 frigates brigs galleys schooners cutters fireship and yatchs cutters are chiefly employed to gua the coast from smugglers   eugen what are smugglers   erast such as bring by sea tea brandy rum and other articles into the country without paying duty by which means the rob the state of part of its revenue   eugen they are liable to be punished for this   erast their goods and vessels are liable to be seized and if they make and resistance the offense is death   eugen by what means does the admiral in an engagement give his direction to other ships   erast by signals that is by flags hoisted on certain parts of the ships and by firing of guns   eugen these signals must be then very numerous how do they contrive not to mistake one for another   erast they are all settled before hand and wrote down and an officer on board each ship is appointed to explain them in short a mariner is so well acquainted with all the business of navigation that there are few mistakes but what are wilful   discourse ix of the courts of law and their officers erast have you my dear eugenius a right comprehension of the courts of law   eugen very far from it it would give me pleasure to have them properly explained   erast i shall not enter into a minute detail of them but content myself with saying only so much as will give you a general idea of the principal of them which are four for there are several that will be unnecessary to burden your memory with we will begin with the lowest  the first then is the court of common pleas calculated to redress injuries committed by one man upon the property of another in any part of the kingdom it was established in westminster hall by king john in      where it has continued ever since the judges of this court are four in number the chief justice of the common pleas and three puisne or under judges who sit every day in term time to hear and determine all matters of law arising in civil causes real or personal   eugen what is meant by civil causes   erast by civil causes are meant all infringements upon property carried on or prosecuted by the person injured in contradistinction to criminal causes which are considered as breaches of the peace and though commenced by the party aggrieved are carried on in the kings name as the chief magistrate and enforcer of the laws  the court of kings bench is the next so called because the king used to sit there in person and is the supreme court of common law in the kingdom it has also four judges a chief justice and three puisne ones   eugen did the king sit in that court as a judge   erast he sat there as he is supposed to do now but was not empowered to determine any cause but by the mouth of his judges   eugen what is the authority of that court   erast this has the superintendance of all civil corporations commands magistrates and others to do what their duty requires protects the liberty of the people hears and determines both in criminal and civil causes and is a court to which we may appeal against all determinations of the court of common pleas and other inferior courts   eugen you mentioned common law what it understood by this   erast common law implies whatever has been customary throughout the kingdom is perhaps as old as the kingdom itself and the term is used to distinguish it from those laws established by act of parliament and which are therefore called statute law  there is another principal court of law called the court of exchequer which is a court of equity too and was established originally to recover debts due to the king people may however apply to this cou for redress such grievances as they generally apply to the court of chancery for there are four judges also of this court called barons of the exchequer a lord chief baron and three others  but the fourth and last is the high court of chancery the most important of all in matters of civil property here the lord chancellor sits as judge and determines the matter by his own decree whereas in the courts of kings bench and common pleas the matter is heard and determined by a jury of twelve men but if a man thinks himself aggrieved even by a decree of the chancellor in the court of chancery he may refer his cause to the decision of the house of lords where it may be reheard   eugen what is it you mean by a jury of twelve men   erast this is esteemed one of the greatest privileges of a british subject that of being tried or having his cause determined by twelve indifferent persons chosen by him out of fortyeight respectable men of his own country who are summoned for that purpose by which means the decision is not left to the determination of the judge alone who might possibly be thought partial   eugen i think you said the court of kings bench had the superintendance of all civil corporations i wish to know the nature of a corporation   erast corporations are bodies of man united by a charter or privilege from the crown for the purpose of protecting their own rights or the rights of the community to which they belong they are empowered to make certain laws of regulation among themselves and to enforce the execution of them if they be not contrary to the laws of the land cities and all borough towns that send members to parliament are towns corporate or little republics and the mayor and aldermen of such corporate bodies are generally magistrates within the limits of the corporation  the corporation of the city of london like that of other towns consists of three branches the lord mayor aldermen and common council in imitation of king lords and commons the city is divided into twelve wards and each ward elects an alderm and a certain number of common council the aldermen meet by themselves and so do the common council and thus between them the business of the corporation is adjusted   eugen why is the mayor of london called lord mayor   erast by a particular privilege the mayors of london york and dublin have the title of lord for the year they serve which the mayors of other towns have not   eugen what are those courts that are held in the country i mean the assizes   erast they are a kind of assistant courts sent by the kings special commission twice a year all round the kings dominions their business is to try by a jury of the respective counties such causes as must otherwise be brought up to westminster thus for the case of the subject justice is brought home to every mans door disputed facts are tried if required in the country by neighbors and criminals are prosecuted where the witnesses are near at hand to attend   eugen are there no other courts of consequence   erast yes the court of admiralty is one at which the lord high admiral or his deputy presides this court is held three or four times a year at the old bailey in london and one of the judges generally acts as the lord admirals deputy it tries all offenses committed on the seas or in parts out of the reach of the common law courts  there are courts also for trying ecclesiastical causes and there is the prerogative court for the trial of wills the judge of which is appointed by the archbishop of canterbury   eugen now you mention wills shall i trouble you to tell me the office of an executor   erast the executor is generally some friend o the deceased appointed by him in his will to execut what is there directed to dispose of the effects and distribute the property according to the will of the testator   eugen suppose he does not choose to undertake it what is then done   erast the next of kin in such case will administer that is apply to the bishops court and take out what is called letters of administrations which are granted by the bishop for that purpose and who will then take care that the tenor of the will is properly complied with but to go on besides the courts i have mentioned there are little courts in almost every county town throughout england called courts of conscience for the recovery of debts under forty shillings   eugen who are the principal people employed in these courts   erast the three chief parties on a trial are the plaintiff that is the complainant the defendant or the party complained against and the judge but in the principal courts there are attorneys and counsel as assistants   eugen what is the office of an attorney   erast an attorney at law in civil courts is as the proctor in the ecclesiastical courts a person whom the plaintiff or defendant appoints to appear for him and manage and conduct his cause these attorney are now formed into a regular body and when admitted to the execution of their office by the courts of westminster hall are officers of those courts who admit them and can practice in no other  of counsel there are two degrees barristers and sergeants barristers after they have been admitted five years in any of the inns of court such as the temple lincolns inn etc that is after five year standing are called to the bar and after sixteen years standing they may be called to the degree of sergeants the judges are always admitted sergeants before they are made judges out of these barristers of sergeants the kings counsel are usually selected the two principal of whom are called his attorney and sollicitorgeneral who are always members of parliament   eugen have the kings counsel any particular privilege   erast they are employed always in crown causes but can be employed in no cause against the crown without special license they are heard always before other counsel and even before sergeants   eugen is merit in this profession ever the means of promotion   erast it seldom is in the church and seldom in the army but almost always here they must have able men and good speakers for judges and for the attorney and solicitorgeneral but of two able men he who has most interest is commonly preferred from common barristers they are promoted to be kings counsel and from kings counsel generally to be masters in chancery and judges such of the counsel as are appointed to be solicitor and attorney general to the king generally come to be chief justices or lord chancellor the solicitorgeneral is commonly promoted to the office of attorney general and thence to be either chief justice or lord chancellor which seldom fails to procure him a peerage for the lord chancellor does not usually continue long in office   eugen was i to choose my profession then it should be that of a barrister   erast you must be first a man of abilities and a good orator for without these a counsel makes but a poor figure and he may be never heard of as long as he lives but if he is a sensible man a good lawyer and a good orator from being at the bar he may get into parliament and there by his eloquence may carry every thing before him and arrive at the highest honors   discourse x on sundry useful subjects eugen by the benefit sir of your instruction i think i am pretty well master of almost every thing necessary to be learded by a young man coming into the world but there are two or three subjects which i am still ignorant of and of which i am very desirous of some little account and that i may not forget them i have minuted them down on a sli of paper will you give me leave to mention them   erast there is one principal part of instruction as necessary to youth as any i have mentioned which in our late discourses i have not yet touched upon that is the art of politeness and of rendering ourselves agreeable to the world and the art of knowing and living in that world but as i have put together every requisite instruction upon that head and published them under the title of principles of politeness and the art of knowing the world i will refer you to that book at present let me hear the subjects you wish to have explained   eugen they are as follow the trojan war the nature of magna charta the habeas corpus bill the navigation act naturalization morgages patents and passports   erast it is very proper you should understand them all and i will explain them to you one after the other the first i think is the trojan war   eugen if you please   erast the siege of troy though founded on fact is so enveloped in fable that the whole has by some been considered as fabulous it is made the subject of an heroic poem written in greek by homer the first of poets who lived nine hundred years before the birth of christ to give you a complete account of it you should first be acquainted with the heathen mythology or the fabulous deities of antiquity however i will give you the best notion of it i can  the city of troy was situated in that part of phrygia adjoining the bosphorus of thrace which is now called the straits of constantinople and flourished about one thousand two hundred years before christ we are told that hecuba the wife of priam king of troy when with child of paris dreamed that she was brought to bed of a flaming torch which being construed by an oracle who was supposed to have the gift of prophecy to imply that the child of which she was big would one day be the ruin of his country and his family her husband priam ordered him when born to be put to death but hecuba secreted him and had him brought up by a shepherd many years afterward paris who was unacquainted with his birth came to troy to contend for a prize which the king proposed to give among his young nobility and won it hector the eldest son of priam enquiring about this young man soon found him to be his brother king priam received him acknowledged him and gave him that rank that was his due some time after paris having been at sparta to recover his aunt hesione whom hercules had run away with took away be force helena the wife of menelaus king of that city and swore he would never return her till his aunt hesione was returned the grecian princes round about took part with menelaus and engaged themselves by oath never to lay down their arms till they had overthrown the city of troy  the grecian army was conducted by    leaders kings princes or heroes much celebrated at that time for singular achievements and agamemnon king of argos and mycene was declared commander in chief among the grecian leaders were nestor achilles and patroclus his friend ajax son of telamon the other ajax idomeneus diomedes ulysses and palimedos their fleet was composed of    0 vessels  the superb city of troy was defended by the all the princes of asia and who to equal the forces of greece assembled a very powerful army they were commanded also by very valiant princes and by all the sons of priam which were  0 in number the eldest of which was hector who alone could have sustained and repulsed all the efforts of the enemy had fate not destined it to the contrary the trojans were every where conquerors under this hero they drove the greeks from every part and burnt their fleet so that they repented of their expedition for achilles was offended with agamemnon and had withdrawn himself which changed the face of things in this general discomfiture patroclus the friend of achilles anxious to recall their good fortune took the arms of achilles and put himself at the head of the grecian army repulsed the trojans and challenged hector to single combat hector advanced and patroclus fell a sacrifice to his sword achilles then exasperated at the death of his friend forgot the offense of agamemnon attacked the trojan hero killed him tied him to his chariot wheels and dragged him round the walls of troy and the grave of his friend patroclus  the death of hector was as great a loss to the trojans as the retreat of achilles had been to the greeks priam demanded a truce or cessation of arms for some days during which time he went with part of his family and some rich presents to request of achilles the dead body of his son that he might bestow upon him the last honors achilles moved with the tears of polixena hectors sister whose beauty had smitten him yielded to priams request paris profited by this circumstance and revenged his brothers death he promised achilles to give him his sister in marriage and kept his word and they were scarce assembled in the temple to solemnize the marriage than paris took an opportunity to murder achilles  enraged at this pyrrhus the son of achilles came with a considerable reenforcement and joined the greeks to revenge the death of his father but the oracle having declared that troy never would be taken whilst it possessed the palladium which was a statue of pallas the goddess of war superstitiously supposed to have descended from heaven and to have placed herself upon the altar diomedes and ulysses took upon them to take it away which they did with great cleverness  the greeks however not being able to make themselves masters of the city by force undertook to surprise it they pretended that minerva had punished them for taking her from the palladium and after ten years siege in which it had cost them the lives of so many great and illustrious men they had recourse to this stratagem they constructed a wooden horse in the belly of which they shut up a great number of armed soldiers and concealed it in the island of tenedos they gave but that they built this horse as an atonement for the injury they had done minerva the trojans on the greeks leaving it crowded round the figure and seduced by a vain hope which was heightened by one sinon whom the greeks instructed to say that if that horse was conveyed within the walls of troy it would thence forth be impregnable seduced i say by this story they instantly proceeded to make a breach in the walls and introduced this fatal machine this day which was the last of troy became a day of merriment in which each man gave way to the blind transports of folly night came on and when the whole city was at rest wrapped up in fatal security the grecian soldiers opened the sides of the horse and under cover of the night spread themselves in all quarters of the city to which they set fire and the flames was a signal to the enemy who entered by the breach and put all to the sword the trojans made a desperate defense and did not yield till they were overpowered by numbers pyrrhus in particular committed unheard of cruelties he broke into priams palace and slew the prince and all his family at the foot of the altar where they had fled for refuge polixenes was considered as the cause of achilless death her pyrrhus sacrificed upon the tumulus or tomb which the greeks had raised to his memory andromache hectors wife had concealed her son aslyanax in the tomb of that hero ulysses found him out and threw him down from the top of a high tower pyrrhus took andromache to epirus afterward and married her  such was the sad fate of the proud city of troy which took place in the year    0 before christ she saw perish before he walls    000 greeks and within her bosom   0000 of her own citizens   eugen was there not a trojan prince that escaped from troy and carried his father upon his shoulders   erast it was eneas he was of the blood royal and fled from the ruins of his country with his father anchises on his back and his son iulus in his hand history tells us that he afterward settled in italy and that one of his descendants founded the empire of rome of which i have given you some little account  what was the next thing you wished to know   eugen the nature of magna charta   erast magna charta is the great charter of liberty which the barons that is the nobility of this country being at war with king john compelled him to sign in the year      under all despotic governments the king not only makes free with the purses of his subjects but also with their persons that is will not only take away their property when he has occasion for it but will imprison them at his pleasure by signing this charter king john renounced for ever in the name of the kings of this country all such arbitrary measures and acquiesced to such terms as to this day have secured the liberties of the subject the habeas corpus bill and act passed in the reign of king charles ii is one of the glorious consequences of this great charter   eugen i wish your would explain it   erast by virtue of this act of parliament no man can be imprisoned without knowing the cause of such imprisonment and having his case fairly argued in a court of justice in all illegal confinements the prisoner may have a writ of habeas corpus directed to the person detaining him and requiring him to take him before a court or before a judge within  0 days of the writ being delivered if a judge refuses to grant such a writ he forfeits  00l to the prisoner if the keeper of a prison refuses to obey the forfeits  00l for the first offense and  00l for the second if when his case is argued he be acquitted he cannot be imprisoned again for the same offense   eugen this certainly is but just   erast it is however what no country but this can boast of what is your next question   eugen the navigation act   erast great britain being an island its whole warlike strength depends upon its marine or its power by sea as a nursery for seamen therefore the fisheries were established and every encouragement is given to foreign commerce and with the same view the navigation act was passed during the republican government of this kingdom when the parliament had put king charles to death by this act not merchandise can be imported into england but in english ships of which the master and threefourths of the crew must be english subjects except it be in the ships of that european country of which the merchandise is the growth or manufacture   eugen why was this exception made   erast to encourage foreigners to trade with us for it would have been hard to have obliged them to hire english vessels to bring here the goods of their own country all we wished to prevent was that no other nation should be the carriers of our merchandise it was america chiefly we had an eye to and the people there before their independence could send nothing here but in english vessels  what is your next question   eugen the nature of naturalization   erast to naturalize a man is to give him the privilege of a subject born in this kingdom neither a jew nor a foreigner can purchase an estate in this country nor inherit one from his ancestors but when he is naturalized he can and foreigners pay more duties on imports and exports than natural born subjects   eugen can all be naturalized that please   erast yes if they choose to be at the expense of an act of parliament which they cannot be without receiving the sacrament according to the church of england and taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance   eugen what are these oaths   erast by the oath of allegiance the man swears loyalty and fidelity to his king and by the oath of supremacy he abjures the pope and acknowledges the king to be the head of the church   eugen what in the expense of an act of parliament   erast about  00l to encourage the jews who are a very trading people to settle with us in preference to other countries some years ago a general naturalization bill was passed to reach to all under certain restrictions but the people of england were so aver to it that had not the parliament immediately reealed it they would have knocked the jews on th head they went so far as to kill one or two at northampton   eugen the other things i wish to know are mortgages patents and passports   erast passports are letters of safe conduct granted under the kings seal to subjects of a foreign power with whom we are at war for without such a passport they cannot pass safely in this country from place to place nor can they convey their merchandise at sea from port to port without its being liable to be seized  patents are exclusive privileges granted by the king to the author of any new invention to have to fool manufacturing and vending of the said invention for fourteen years   eugen can any one obtain a patents   erast any one the applies for it on his swearing that he is the original inventor but it is in the breast of the king to refuse it if he thinks proper   eugen what is the expense of obtaining one   erast about fourscore pounds   eugen now sir for mortgages and i will make my bow   erast a mortgage is when a man borrows of another a certain sum of money and grants him an estate on condition that if he repays the money on a certain fixed day the person holding the estate shall return it to its former owner the person borrowing the money is called the mortgagor and the person lending it the mortgagee there is another article which you have not enquired about but which is equally necessary for you to know   eugen what is that sir   erast the nature of the mortmain act when popery was the established religion of this country it was customary for the monks to persuade persons on their death beds by alarming arguments to leave part if not the whole of their property to the convent to which they belonged and they so often succeeded as to become proprietors of very considerable estates which were thus perpetually inherent in one dead hand to prevent this many laws from time to time have been ade and no person now can leave by will any sur of money to a charitable use unless it be bequeathed and enrolled in chancery twelve months before the death of the testator   eugen accept my best thanks for the information you have given me and you shall see that i will profit by it   eugen do this my dear eugenius and i am amply gratified   index the nature of the following articles is described in this work act of parliament p           0
