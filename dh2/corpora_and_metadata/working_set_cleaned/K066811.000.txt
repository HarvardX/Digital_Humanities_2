edwin and eltruda  a legendary tale  price two shillings  edwin and eltruda  a legendary tale  by a young lady  mark it cesario it is true and plain the spinsters and the knitters in the sun and the free maids that weave their thread with bones do use to chant it it is silly sooth and dallies with the innocence of love like the old age shakspeares twelfth night london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxii  advertisement by the editor the young lady who is the writer of the following poem is a native of london but was removed with her family in very early life to a remote part of the kingdom where her sole instruction was derived from a virtuous amiable and sensible mother in so distant a situation she had such little access to books that when the piece now presented to the public was written she had not read mr cartwrights armine and elvira dr percys hermit of warkworth and other beautiful productions of that kind on her return to the metropolis last summer the poem being shown to several of her acquaintance they earnestly requested its publication to which she has consented with the modesty and diffidence that in the season of youth are the usual concomitants of true virtue having long been intimate with the family i with pleasure undertook the task of editor and my pleasure will be greatly increased if this performance shall meet with a favorable reception from the judges of poetical merit should there be found in it many marks of an elegant and pathetic genius to these not only the candid but even the judicious critic will direct his principal attention and will be disposed to forgive the simplicity of the story and that diffusion of sentiment which is so natural to a youthful mind in its first essays in composition  feb         and kippis  errata page

i  edwin and eltruda where the clear derwents waters glide along their mossy bed close by the rivers verdant side a castle reared its head the ancient pile by time erasd and levelled with the ground once many a sculptured trophy graced and banners waved around there lived a chief to fame well known a warlike virtuous knight who many a wellfought field had won by valor and by might what time in martial pomp he led his chosen gallant train the foe that erst had conquered fled indignant fled the plain yet milder virtues he possessed more gentle passions felt and in his calm and yielding breast each soft affection dwelt not all the rugged toils of war his bosom ever could steel he felt for every child of care his heart was apt to feel and much that heart was doomed to bear and many a grief to prove to feel the fullness of despair the woes of hopeless love to lose the partner of his breast who soothed each rising care and with mild efforts charmed to rest the griefs she sought to share he marked the chilling damps of death overspread her fading charms he saw her yield her quivering breath and sink in deaths cold arms from solitude he hoped relief and this lone mansion sought to cherish there his sacred grief and nurse the tender thought here object of his fondest cares an infant daughter smiled and often the mourners falling tears bedewed his emmas child these tears as over the babe he hung would tremble in his eye while blessings faultring on his tongue were breathed but in a sigh for many a sad revolving year his hopeless griefs endure for ah a sorrow so severe it is death alone can cure yet time can soften the deep wound it has not power to heal and in this child he thought he found his muchloved emma still in his eltrudas gentle breast his griefs he could repose with each endearing virtue blessed she softened all his woes it was easy in her look to trace an emblem of her mind there dwelt each mild attractive grace each gentle grace combined soft as the dews of morn arise and on the pale flower gleam so soft so sweet her melting eyes with love and pity beam as far retired the lonely flower smiles in the desert vale and blows its balmy sweets to pour upon the flying gale so lived in solitude unseen this lovely peerless maid so sweetly graced the vernal scene and blossomed in the shade yet love could pierce the lone recess for there he loves to dwell he scorns the noisy crowd to bless and seeks the lowly cell there only his resistless dart in all its power is known his empire sways each willing heart they live to love alone edwin of every grace possessed first taught her heart to prove that gentlest passion of the breast to seel the power of love though few the pastures he possessed though scanty was his store though wealth never swelled his hoarded chest edwin could boast of more edwin could boast the liberal mind the generous ample heart and every virtue heaven inclined to bounty can impart the maxims of this servile age the mean the selfish care the sordid views that now engage the mercenary pair whom riches can unite or part to them was all unknown for then the sympathetic heart was linked by love alone they little knew that wealth had power to make the constant rove they little knew the splendid dower could add a bliss to love they little knew the human breast could pant for sordid ore or of a faithful heart possessed could ever wish for more and though her peerless beauty warms his heart to love inclined not less he felt the lasting charms the beauties of her mind not less his gentle soul approved the virtues glowing there for surely virtue to be loved needs only to appear the sweets of dear domestic bliss each circling hour beguiled and meekeyd hope and inward peace on the lone mansion smiled often over the daisysprinkled mead they wandered far away some lambkin to the fold to lead that happily chanced to stray her heart where pity loved to dwell with sadness often was wrung for the bruised insect as it fell her soft tear trembling hung as roving over the flowery waste a sigh would heave her breast the while her gentle hand replacd the linnets falling nest then would she seek the vernal bower and haste with tender care to nurse some pale declining flower some opening blossom rear and often with eager steps she flies to cheer the lonely cot where the poor widow pour her sighs and wails her hapless lot their weeping mothers trembling knees her lisping infants clasp their meek imploring look she fees she feels their tender grasp wild throbs her aching bosom swell they mark the bursting sigh  nature has formed the soul to feel they weep unknowing why  her hands the liberal boon impart and much her tear avails to sooth the mourners bursting heart where feeble utterance fails on the pale cheek where hung the tear of agonizing woe she bids the gush of joy rise there the tear of rapture flow if greater plenty to impart she ever would heaven implore twas only that her ample heart still panted to do more thus soft the gliding moments flew though love would court their stay while some new virtue rose to view and marked each fleeting day peace long condemned the world to roam like the poor wandering dove here softlyresting found a home and wished no more to rove the youthful poets soothing dream of youthful ages past the muses fond ideal theme was realizd at last joy springs amid encircling cares to breasts where virtue glows for virtue in this vale of tears a paradise bestows but vainly here we hope that bliss unchanging will endure ah in a world so vain as this what heart can rest secure for now arose the deathfraught day for civil discord famed when york from lancasters proud sway the royal scepter claimed the passing moments now were fraught with desolating rage and now the bloody deeds were wrought that swell the historic page the good old albert vows again to seek the hostile field the cause of henry to maintain the spear for him to wield but oh a thousand sacred ties that bind the heros soul a thousand tender claims arise and edwins breast control and link the youth to henrys foes  but ah it rends his heart the aged albert to oppose to bear an adverse part though passion pleads in henrys cause and edwins heart would sway yet honors stern imperious laws the brave will still obey oppressed with many a mingled care full often eltruda sighed and mourned the rugged brow of war should those she loved divide at length the fatal morn arose in gloomy vapors dressed the pensive maidens sorrow flows and pale fear heaved her breast a thousand pangs the father feels a thousand tender fears while at his feet she trembling kneels and bathes them with her tears a falling drop bedewed his cheek from the sad scene he flew the tender father could not speak  he could not say  adieu then edwin hapless edwin came he saw her pallid look and tremblings seize her tender frame while thus he faultring spoke  this cruel tenderness but wounds  the heart it means to bless  those falling tears those plaintive sounds  increase the soft distress  then be to wretched edwin kind  nor mourn dear tender maid  at length on edwins breast reclined eltruda faintly said  if fate relentless has decreed  on yonder hostile plain  my edwins destined heart to bleed  and swell the heaps of slain  trust me my love i will not complain  i will shed no feeble tear  not one weak drop my cheek shall stain  or tell what passes here  ah let thy fate of others claim  a tear a tender sigh  i will only murmur thy dear name   call on my love  and die twere vain for feeble words to tell the pangs their bosoms proved they only can conceive it well whose hearts have trembling loved the timid muse forbears to say what laurels edwin won nor paints the gallant deeds that day by aged albert done on softer themes alone she dwells as trembling through the grove of friendships woes she sadning tells or sings of hapless love though long the beaming day was fled the fight they still maintain while night a deeper horror shed over the ensanguind plain the martial trump invades the ear and drowns the orphans cry no more the widows shriek they hear the lovelorn virgins sigh the pangs those dearbought laurels yield alas what tongue can speak perchance not one that strews the field but leaves some heart to break to alberts breast the faulshion flew  he felt a mortal wound the drops that warmed his heart bedew and stain the flinty ground the foe who aimed the deadly dart heard his expiring sighs soft pity touched his yielding heart to albert straight he flies  while round the chief his arms he cast while often his bosom sighed and seemed as if it mourned the past  old albert faintly cried  though nature heaves these feeble groans  without complaint i die  yet one dear care my heart still owns  still feels one tender tie  for york a youth well known to fame  uplifts the hostile spear  edwins the blooming heros name  to alberts bosom dear  ah tell him my expiring sigh  say my last words besought  to my despairing child to fly  ere fame the tidings brought he spoke  but oh what mournful strain in sadness apt to melt what moving numbers can explain the pangs that edwin felt for edwin twas himself that held the dying warrior pressed whom the dark shades of night concealed close to his throbbing breast  ah fly he cried my touch profane  oh how the rest impart  twas edwin plunged  revered old man   the dagger in thy heart his dying eyes he feebly raised which seemed for ever closed on the pale youth they piteous gazed  and then in death reposed   i will go the hapless edwin said  and breathe a last adieu  and with the drops despair will shed  my mourning love bedew  i will go the tender maid to seek  to catch her bursting sigh  to wipe the tear from her pale cheek  and at her feet to die and as the tender maid to seek the frantic mourner flew to wipe the tear from her pale cheek and breathe a last adieu appalled his startling fancy sees his true loves sorrows flow and hears in every passing breeze the plaintive sounds of woe mean while the weeping maid whose prayers in vain would heaven implore of alberts fate despairing hears but yet had heard do more she saw her muchloved edwin near  she saw and piteous sighed the sight chilled every falling tear  at length she faintly cried  eternal woes this heart must prove  its tenderest ties are broke  ah say what ruthless arm my love  could aim the deadly stroke  could not thy hand my edwin thine  have warded off the blow  for ah he was not only mine  he was thy father too no longer edwin could endure the pangs no strains can tell from death he fondly hoped a cure as senseless cold he fell she flew  she gave her sorrows vent  a thousand tears she poured her mournful voice her moving plaint the youth to life restored  why wildly throbs each shivering vein  she cried my edwin speak   or all unable to sustain  these pangs my heart will break  yes  it will break he frantic cried  for me will life resign   then trembling know thy father died  and know the guilt was mine  it is enough  with short quick breath exclaimed the mournful maid she spoke no more but seemed from death to hope for instant aid but lo a pensive silent train with downcast looks appear who alberts pallid corse sustain placed on a sable bier for hapless edwin fondly thought it might some comfort yield if good old alberts corse were brought from off the bloodstained field he thought twould sooth eltrudas pains over the dear hallowed urn which alberts sacred dust contains a while her griefs to mourn but ah all frantic at the sight a hurried glance she threw then starting wild with pale affright that hurried glance withdrew trembling she rushed and in her arms the dear remains she pressed but sudden paleness veiled her charms so late in beauty dressed in plaintive accents edwin cries  and have i murdered thee   to other worlds thy spirit flies  and mine this stroke shall free his hand the deathfraught weapon grasped the steel he firmly pressed when sudden she arose and clasped him wildly to her breast  methought she cried with panting breath  my edwin talked of peace  i knew twas only found in death  and feared that sad release  to clasp him still  twas but a dream   help yon wide wound to close  from which a fathers spirits stream  a fathers lifeblood flows  but see from thee he shrinks nor would  be blasted by thy touch   ah though my edwin spilt thy blood  yet once he loved thee much  my father yet in pity stay  i see his white beard wave   a spirit beckons him away  and points to yon cold grave  even now my love i trembling hear  him breath a last adieu  i see my love the falling tear  his furrowed cheek bedew  i feel within his aged arms  his poor eltruda pressed  i hear him speak the fond alarms  that wring a parents breast  he is gone  and here his ashes sleep  i do not heave a sigh   his child a father does not weep  for ah my brain is dry  but come together let us rove  at the pale hour of night  when the moon glimmering through the grov  shall shed her faintest light  well gather from the rosy bower  the fairest wreaths that bloom  well cull my love each opening flow  to deck his hallowed tomb  well thither from the distant dale  a weeping willow bear  and plant a lily of the vale  a drooping lily there  well shun the glaring face of day  eternal silence keep  through the dark wood well chearless stray  and only live to weep  but hark  it is come  the fatal time  when edwin we must part  some angel tells me it is a crime  to hold thee to my heart  my fathers spirit hovers near  alas he comes to chide   is there no means my edwin dear  the fatal deed to hide  none none  for wheresoeer we go  lo streams of blood proceed  and should the torrent cease to flow  yet still our hearts would bleed  our hearts the secret would betray  the tale of death reveal  angels would come in dread array  the bloody deed to tell  yet edwin if the offense be thine  too soon i can forgive  but oh the guilt would all be mine  could i endure to live  farewell my love  for ah i faint  of pale despair i die   and see that hoary murdered saint  descends from yon blue sky  poor weak old man  he comes my love  to lead to heaven the way  he knows not heaven will joyless prove  while edwin is away  it is too much he frantic cried then to his bosom pressed the dying maid who piteous sighed  and sunk to endless rest he saw her dying eyelids close he heard her latest sigh and yet no tear of anguish flows fast streaming from his eye for ah the fullness of despair the pang of highwrought woe admits no silent trembling tear no lenient drop to flow he feels within his shivering veins a mortal chillness rise her pallid corse he feebly strains  and on her bosom dies no longer may their hapless lot the mournful muse engage she wipes away the tears that blot the melancholy page for heaven in love dissolves the ties that chain the spirit here and distant far for ever flies the blessing held most dear to bid the suffrers soul aspire a higher bliss to prove to wake the pure refined desire the hope that rests above finis
