false impressions a comedy in five acts performed at the theater royal covent garden by richard cumberland esquire  saepe etiam audacem fugat hoc terretque poetam quod numero plures virtute et honor

prologue spoken by mr murray the time has been but in a barbarous age when poets braved their audience from the stage poets pontifical whose lofty tone acknowledged no tribunal but their own and sent their prologuepurveyor to raise first fruits and fines of tributary praise our modern bards are taught an humbler strain and if less valiant are not half so vain no longer aim the nations taste to lead content if they can follow and succeed thus if the time should come when in the place of nature you should substitute grimace fatal reverse what could the poet do offend the many to appease the few no if in greece true taste had been as scarce the stagyrite himself had stood for farce if wit through five long acts will not hold out momus must help to stir the laugh about and when you crown his mummery with applause you bribe him to transgress the dramas laws he were a very wild romantic elf who only wrote to figure on the shelf to hear his own sad sentiments rebound through empty galleries with a dying sound and sit like seneca in calm decay watching how life steals drop by drop away no let him take his profit and his ease and trifle on so long as trifles please too weak to struggle against fashions tide if with the current he is content to glide he only yields as caesar did before when tibers torrent drove him from the shore the simple tale we have to tell this night shows truth triumphant over rancrous spite casts in dark shades the base defamers part and crowns with just reward the liberal heart oh might our efforts gain their wished for end the gay to amuse the faulty to amend make fiction rule her thoughts by natures laws and wit exert her powers in virtues cause then and then only might we claim applause dramatis personae sir oliver montrath mr murray

virgin mrs buckram pretty rachel williams and the rest of the fair nuns   simon name em not you have not left your fellow what is rachel williams a baby   jenny well but mrs buckram  she is no baby   simon no of my word she is of the race of the anakims   jenny no matter for that friend simon you will marry buckram   simon no no that buckram shall never stick in my skirts harapha of gath would not marry her i am no knight errant to encounter giants   jenny i should think so for if you were a true knight you would not sleep before you had set free your lovely prisoner emily fitzallan   simon there is one acoming will do that fair emily will be a wife before you will be a widow young montrath is the man for her he is expected every day with his uncle sir oliver it is all agreed upon and my ladys whole fortune will be settled on miss emily there is a start for you  there is a sally from dependence to prosperity from wanting every thing to possessing all   jenny and nothing left to harry algernon   simon yes patience if he possesses it and an illname whether he merits it or not   jenny well i cannot see the justice of all this   simon who can where lawyer earling is concerned that puppy of an attorney lords it over the whole castle and now we are in the bustle of setting out miss emily in a style before sir oliver arrives there are fine dresses to be made fine apartments to be furnished and fresh servants to be hired for the heiress   jenny say you so fresh servants are you full if not i can recommend you such a lacquey  the very man of men  jerry shall bring him to you   simon bring him yourself lead him over in a white bridle and let me judge of his points and his paces   jenny you shall  my life for yours miss emily will be charmed with him   simon adieu time flies when i am with you once more adieu i shall expect you i hope you are happy with your little doctor but i must think you were much too fine a flower to be plucked by an apothecary and stuck into a gallipot   exit jenny he is off you may come out of your hiding hole the coast is clear   enter algernon followed by scud alg now my fair advocate what have you done for me is there any hope   jenny of the old ladys fortune none your aunt has not left you a shilling   alg i am glad of it   scud i wonder why   jenny miss emily is to have the whole   alg i am sorry for it   scud i wonder wherefore   alg i will tell you then had my aunt bequeathed to me her fortune she would have probably restricted me from marrying emily having given it to emily she has doubtless tied her up from marrying me had she done neither one nor the other i have enough to maintain her and the prize had been my own   jenny and so she shall i have a project for your meeting   alg i doubt if i ought to seek it   scud very true lay it aside altogether it will bring a plaguey deal of mischief upon me and do no good to you   alg tell it me however   jenny you will comprehend it at once there is a proper valet to be hired for the heiress fit to wait upon her person and grace the back of her chair at table   alg i cannot do it i am not equal to the task i cannot approach so near and yet refrain when she spoke to me i should be lost when she looked on me i should betray myself and when i handed her the plate i should present it on my knee   scud aye then you would be vollied out of the window and i kicked out of the doors now silly jenny what is become of your project   alg hold there though dangerous in the extreme it is not altogether desperate if i cannot undertake the offices you describe i may yet present myself as a candidate for her service and in that character perhaps obtain an interview with my charmer that hope is worth an effort   scud it is not worth a farthing and will be pounds and pounds out of my way cursed scrape foolish jenny cursed scrape   alg but where shall i get a proper dress to appear in   scud no where you cannot appear at all   jenny fear nothing i will provide you with a dress   scud egad she has a provision for every thing   alg who but must conquer that is armed by the fair there is a rascal in the family earling by name who has slanderously defamed me i will wring his ears from his head   scud take care earling is an attorney and if he has any ears you will pay for wringing them if he has none you will be puzzled to lay hold of them   alg come jerry i see what staggers you you are afraid of losing the old ladys custom   scud you are right i am she takes physic and you take pleasure   alg mark me i will not promise you to swallow as many medicines as she does but come what will i will guarantee you against all losses incurred on my account so fear nothing but come on discretion i cannot boast of but in honor i will never be found wanting   scud that is enough that is enough deal upon honor and i am with you i love to do a good natured action when there is nothing to be lost by it   exeunt scene changes to an apartment in lady cypresss castle lady cypress lawyer earling lady cyp enter enter mr earling you come upon a wish   earl ever prompt to approve myself your ladyships most devoted and most absolute humble servant upon a wish i come upon a word i vanish   lady cyp i am satisfied with your diligence you may spare yourself the trouble of describing it   earl i am dumb   lady cyp have you the memorandums about you that i dictated   earl if my tears have not defaced them believe me gracious lady when i saw my own name set down to a bequest so munificent i was covered with blushes i was choked with gratitude   lady cyp out with it then out with your name if such is the effect and write in algernons i warrant gratitude will not choke him   earl good very good your ladyship has the gift of rallying me in the most pleasant way out of my metaphors choke is a figure somewhat of the strongest   lady cyp why yes and i should think you may venture upon the legacy and risque the effects of it so copy out your paper when you please   earl i will set my clerks upon it out of hand   lady cyp you will set the world upon it when i am out of it for you have totally cashiered harry algernon and he is the son of my sister   earl and your sister was the wife of his father and his father was your unremitting persecutor who vexed you with a suit in chancery for ten long years and ten might have been added to ten had it not been that i  i speak modestly of myself i am no egotist  i speak simply of number one and nobody else for your barrister was a cipher    lady cyp but a cipher put to number one adds no trifle to its value so the upshot is you gained the suit and i paid the costs  a victory little to be envied  and after all is it just and equitable the son should suffer for the fathers faults   earl o jus et aequum as if he had not faults enough of his own to warrant your exclusion of him   lady cyp i have heard enough of his faults i confess if you are correct in describing them if you have deceived me    earl i i deceive you i defame your nephew i who have never spoke of his offenses but with regret and sorrow never brought a story to your ears but with the view of intercepting malice and softening down impressions i deceive you then where is truth and virtue   lady cyp both in sight as i should hope  for emily appears   emily fitzallan enters earl i humbly take my leave miss emily i am yours  humph not a word your faithful friend to serve you not a look upstart i will marry the old lady and cut her out of every shilling  i will   exit earling lady cyp approach my dear come near me i must talk with you well you have been to see the apartment i have newly furnished  and do you like it emily   emily it is elegant in the extreme  it is sumptuous   lady cyp it is yours my dear it is to grace my emily that i have decked it out   emily for me such finery   lady cyp child of my heart for you all i possess is yours   emily i hope you will not tempt me to forget that i was poor and humble   lady cyp i hope not nature has endowed you with admirable qualities prosperity i trust will not pervert them it does not quite come on you by surprise you could not well suppose i should adopt the son of my most unrelenting persecutor   emily i did not dare to reason in that case   lady cyp but you must know how worthless in himself how undeserving of my favor is he who in respect of consanguinity is the only person that could supersede you   emily you speak of mr algernon   lady cyp i do i speak of him whom no one speaks of but with reproach and scorn   emily i do confess i have heard much evil speaking but twas from one who should have more respect for truth and decency than to traduce the nephew to the aunt   lady cyp what do you mean would you defend a libertine   emily no madam i defend no libertine but you will not be angry if i avow that i detest a libeller if he who thus has poisoned your opinion knows not the character the manners habits sentiments connections perhaps not even the outward form and feature of the man whose fame he mangles can i be to blame if i implore you for the love of justice to hear before you strike   lady cyp what is this emily what is this warmth   emily honest not prudent out of time and place but still sincere though rash   lady cyp you call on me to hear before i strike i now demand if you that strike have heard do you know algernon have you conversed with him   emily madam i have   lady cyp you have when where he comes not hither never was admitted never will be within these doors astonishing that you should dare to tell me you have made acquaintance with this profligate   emily hear my defense  you gave me leave to pass a little time for change of air after my late confinement at your hillfarm one evening i had rambled about a mile from home when upon entering a little copse through which my footpath led judge of my horror when a villain such i must call him surpised me seized me and in spite of cries prayers and entreaties    lady cyp merciful providence what do you tell me   emily a dreadful tale i should have had to tell or died ere i could tell it had not heaven sent me a rescue a brave brave preserver who with a soul all fire and motion quick as lightning sprung on the assailant grasped him in his arms and after a contention furious though short hurled him to the ground breathless and maimed with bruises  which of these merits the name of profligate not be that saved me  it was algernon   lady cyp algernon do you say my worthless nephew algernon take care   emily renounce me if i tell you an untruth   lady cyp i am all astonishment who was the assailant   emily madam i know not your heroic nephew bore me half dead and fainting to my house twas not till then i knew him to be algernon he staid with me no longer than till the care of the good people had recovered me the next morning i returned to the castle fearing to remain any longer in so solitary a place of algernon i saw no more now suffer me to ask is this the conduct of a profligate   lady cyp it is a strange story   emily it is a true one madam   lady cyp why have you kept it to yourself thus long you have been returned two days   emily because until this hour i have not seen your spirits in a state to bear the slightest agitation   lady cyp and do you think the agitation slight that i now suffer no i see your danger emily i see your weak credulity and much i fear you will find yourself the dupe of algernon what business could he have at my hillfarm   emily madam your tenants wife nursed mr algernon   lady cyp she never should have nursed you emily or harbored you one moment had i known it   emily that is hard but i must suffer and be silent   lady cyp be silent then and go to your chamber there you may meditate on what you have been and call to mind with timely recollection what you may be again   end of act i act ii cast hall  simon single farmer gawdry and his son isaac simon master gawdry master gawdry have i not

you say to it   earl nothing   lady cyp what nothing then you dont believe it   earl pardon me madam i believe it happened just as miss emily relates it to you i do believe there was a man set on to frighten her and that he took a drubbing from her hero for which i also perfectly believe he was well paid   lady cyp why should you not suppose it might be real there are such drunken fellows up and down   earl but sober men will not be taken in by such stale tricks you meet the same or something very like it in even paltry novel that you read the mans escaped you will never hear of him his bargain was not made to go to prison   lady cyp i see it now i see through the contrivance   earl yes madam and you may also see which way your property will go if ever miss has the disposal of it   lady cyp i will never sign those deeds in her behalf till she consents to marry as i would have her indeed indeed you have saved me my good sir from a most rash and inconsiderate measure   earl now is the time i will seize the happy moment  my ever honored lady i but live to save and serve you my whole life has been devoted to your happiness the founder of your fortune i have fought your battles manfully and stood a siege as long as that of troy in your defense aye and would die in it if need required   lady cyp there is no need  i know your services and at my death you will find i have not underrated them   earl she melts  i will strike  not at your death dear lady may that be far far off but with your life reward me  hah that tells she yields to the impression    lady cyp how with my life you have my good opinion you have my friendship what more can i do for you   earl think of me only as i think of you why should a thankless girl engross your fortune use it employ it many happy days are yet in store for you when the lord cypress married you he was your senior by a pretty many years more than your ladyship is mine   lady cyp your inference from that   earl i dare not quite reveal it i would wish your ladyship to take it to your thoughts a hint a word a look so it were kind would greatly help me to declare it to you   lady cyp well talk no more at present if you please you will remember youre my agent sir and i will not forget your services  good day to you   earl may every day and every hour be happy as i could wish them and you will be blessed  twill do  her pride is dropping from the perch  she totters i shall catch her   exit simon single enters lady cyp how now simon have you found a proper lad amongst the tenants sons to serve miss emily   simon of them not one so help me honored lady  i cannot recommend them they are boors clowns clodpates   lady cyp what is to be done   simon there is a youth attending  doctor scud speaks in his favor   lady cyp scuds a babbler  what do you say   simon he is above the level of these indigenous smockfrocks and hobnails i should advise your ladyship to see him   lady cyp by all means let him enter   simon henry you are permitted to approach the lady cypress deigns to look upon you  make your obeisance   algernon enters lady cyp so this is the young man  henry you call him what other name belongs to him   simon scudamore an please you so he gives in himself   lady cyp no vulgar name  and so far as appearances bespeak no vulgar person well henry scudamore you want a place   alg i wish to serve your ladyship   lady cyp have you been in service   alg never   lady cyp so i should guess what leads you now to seek it   alg the ambition of belonging to your ladyship but i would answer more directly might i presume    lady cyp i understand you simon leave the room exit simon you seem embarrassd was it not your wish to speak to me in private   alg madam it was   lady cyp and what have you to impart that one who possibly may be your fellow servant might not be privy to   alg madam i am a gentleman by birth that being known amongst my fellow servants might chance to raise an evil mind against me and make my humble station painful to me your candor will not think the worse of me because i am unfortunate   lady cyp no not the worse in charity of thought but i cannot employ you in my service no gentleman must wait upon that lady to whom i else perhaps had destined you  no gentleman at least of your appearance   alg i am sorry for it  but it is my fate to be judged by appearances and condemned by reports   lady cyp if you have fallen into this decay by mere misfortune or injurious treatment i can pity you nay henry scudamore if that is your name and if i knew your story which at present i have not time to hear i could do more  i could and something whispers me i would consider your necessities and help you   alg i am the victim madam of a villain my story is soon told for it is founded on a simple fact which i can make appear to full conviction if you will condescend to give me hearing and suffer me to state such evidence as cannot be opposed by my defamer   lady cyp i know not what to say to that young man i have no strength to spare for others burdens and am already loaded with my own even to the breaking down of my weak frame if it is a case of pity i have a hand that is open to your wants without enquiry if it is matter of grievance and redress i would recommend you to state it to my lawyer mr earling and he shall see you righted   alg i humbly thank you i will state it to him and trust the goodness of your heart will see me righted   lady cyp ah i have no heart no health no nerves to hear you you must excuse me henry scudamore i dare not undertake to arbitrate but wait sir oliver montraths arrival and he shall hear you he is a noble gentleman   alg where shall i wait the whilst   lady cyp where let me see  yes you may stay this night here in the castle my old servant simon will entertain you at the second table does that content you   alg i were most unthankful if it did not   lady cyp follow me then and i will give my orders   exeunt emilys apartment emily fitzallan rachel williams emily rachel   rachel madam what are your commands   emily dont answer me in that style i have so long been a dependant and lived in such familiarity with you my good rachel in particular that though you are my servant i dont wish you to use a language to me so submissive   rachel whatever language you would have me use so it will but convey the same respect i will endeavor to conform to it   emily i would fain keep upon such terms with fortune that i may fall back to my former poverty without a pang therefore if ever you perceive me giddy with prosperity recall my recollection to the low situation i emergd from and do it honestly my girl dont spare me   rachel you will want no monitor to warn you against pride and yet as you require sincerity there is one warning i conceive is needful just at this crisis   emily state it without reserve   rachel are you not now in danger of incurring your patronesss most severe displeasure   emily perhaps i am but be explicit with me   rachel your champion algernon has he not left a thorn in that soft heart   emily if you call gratitude a thorn he has   rachel are you quite sure it is only gratitude may it not soon be love nay give me leave  is it not love already   emily well if it is how can i strive against it   rachel prudence will tell you how   emily prudence will tell me an old gossips tale but who that is in love will hear her out   rachel are you aware how fatal it will be to all your expectations if my lady discovers your attachment   emily are you aware how natural it is to love the man who saves you from destruction my lady gives me riches algernon rescues my life and honor i was lost but for his courage i am only poor without her bounty and if she demands that i should sacrifice my hearts affections she makes conditions that i cannot grant nor would her fortune bribe me to the attempt   rachel do you know mr algernons character   emily does he that blackens it what does my lady know but what that lawyer instills into her ear infamous man and why does he defame him why but because he may retain his power in the estate and garbel it at pleasure besides he has an ample legacy believe me i hold it a disgrace to read my name in the same page with his nor would i be his partner in the crime of plundering algernon but that i live in hopes the time will come when i may render back the unlawful spoil   rachel then temporize the whilst my dearest lady or that time never will be yours   emily it is right you counsel well and now i will confide a secret to you i have warned algernon who is his enemy and what base stories have been forged against him  ah who is this it is he it is he himself   algernon enters alg hush not so loud   emily your name was on my lips how came you here how did you gain admission and what have you in view by this disguise you may disclose this friendly girl is secret   alg then let her stay i would not be surpised in private

one of his servants is already come he may be soon expected   emily and his nephew does he accompany him   alg i did not ask that question of the servant but if you wish it i will make the enquiry   emily no let it pass i know your aunt expects him  hark rachel somebody is at the door  see who it is   rachel madam there is nobody nor any sound that i can hear   emily stand where you are and listen  what is the meaning of this dress you wear   alg i put it on to counterfeit a servant or i should rather say to ask for service  will you not try me emily dont take my character from that attorney i will serve you honestly   emily you serve youre jesting   alg am i not your servant i am your faithful servant   emily my heroic preserver  that is your rightful character and by that title you have a claim upon my gratitude which only can expire with life  and now inform me what you have in view by this adventure   alg i am not so romantic as to think i can maintain my post longer than till tomorrow to which time i have a furlough by authority if fortune stands my friend i may effect something within that period but even now am i not supremely blessed to see you hear you and behold that face that was of late so pale and wan with terror restored to all the luster of its charms   emily that face assure yourself will never be turned from you to league with those who seek to rob you of your fame and fortune   alg i am not robbed of what enriches you   emily the heart that swells with indignation against all that wrong you had but for you been cold and motionless    alg oh emily forbear   emily this and no more  i never will be made the slave of interest or dupe of slander my confidence in you cannot be shaken my obligations cannot be computed the life that i possess is of

am become a shattered wreck on shore   sir oliv not so not altogether so thank heaven time is a surly guest whose courtesy does not improve by long acquaintance with us but well not rail at him since he permits us once more to meet  and here is the same old castle still unspoilt by modern foppery aye and the same old grand sires firm in their frames with not one wrinkle more than when i parted from them years ago   lady cyp aye years indeed  but you have filled them up with glory yours has been a life of themes for future history a field of laurels to adorn your tomb  mine has been tame and simple vegetation   sir oliv i have lived a soldiers life but heaven be thanked i have plundered no nabob stripped no rajah of his pearls and pagodas nor have i any blood upon my sword but what a soldiers honor may avow  but you have here a relict of my gallant comrade major antony fitzallan he was wounded by my side carried off the field and died in my arms with his last breath he bequeathed it was all he had to bestow a blessing to his daughter and charged me if i lived to come to england to thank you for your charity and be a friend to her   lady cyp i trust you will find her worthy of your friendship   sir oliv is she good is she amiable has she her fathers principles her mothers purity   lady cyp see her and judge she is naturally sincere  but where is your nephew where is mr lionel  i reckoned with much pleasure upon seeing him   sir oliv ah my good lady there i am unfortunate i had built upon the hopes of presenting him to you but it cannot be at present poor lionel is indisposed and must bear his disappointment with what philosophy he can   lady cyp the disappointment is reciprocal  a little time i hope will bring him to us   sir oliv i wish it may  but look who comes    lady cypr this is my orphan charge  this is our emily   emily fitzallan enters sir oliv the very image of her lovely mother   lady cyp my dear this is sir oliver montrath mine and your fathers friend as such you will honor him   sir oliv as such i claim the privilege to embrace and press her to my heart my child my charge devolved upon me by a fathers legacy when breathing out his gallant soul in prayers and blessings for his emily   emily oh sir was you was you beside him at that dreadful moment   sir oliv i was my child these arms supported him covered with wounds and crowned with victory  alas how dearly purchased   emily then let his last commands be ever sacred if you have any such in charge to give me impart them i conjure you   sir oliv i have none but blessings to impart in fortunes gifts the hero had no share in virtues he abounded in the care of this your generous benefactress he had left you to that and heavens protection he bequeathed you   emily i am content and what before i owed in gratitude to this beneficent and noble lady i now will pay with filial obedience and duty superadded suffer me dearest madam from this moment to call myself your daughter   lady cyp as such i have adopted you remember now my child the duty you have taken on yourself the authority you have consigned to me all rights parental center now in me your happiness your credit your establishment are trusts for which i am responsible  you have no other task but to obey   emily obedience madam has its limitations but such as i would render to my father i will pay to you have i your leave to withdraw   lady cyp you may my dear your spirits seem to need it  go and compose yourself   exit emily sir oliv exquisite creature i am enchanted with her by heaven twould be the height of my ambition the object i have most at heart in life to see my lionel  oh that i could  here kneeling at her feet  born of such parents trained by such instructions and graced with charms so lovely emily without a fortune is a match for princes   lady cyp if such is your disinterested wish and greater happiness i could not pray for i trust my fortune thrown into her scale will not make her appear less worthy of your nephew or cause you to retract your good opinion   sir oliv no surely but i doubt if i should wish your fortune to go out of the right channel even to emily we that have never married should regard our nephews as our sons   lady cyp but does affinity impose on me an obligation to bestow my property on one that merits nothing to the wrong of her that merits all   sir oliv is that the character of algernon is he so undeserving   lady cyp ah there my friend there is my terror the destiny i dread the man of all men living the most dangerous to my peace is algernon   sir oliv indeed   lady cyp preserve my emily from him  save her from algernon   sir oliv is algernon then born to be a curse to both of us   lady cyp explain yourself   sir oliv he is your nephew therefore i was silent but if he is dangerous to your peace of mind to mine he is fatal  in one word the wound of which my hapless lionel now languishes was given by the hand of algernon   lady cyp horrible wretch  his murderer    sir oliv i say not that for modern courtesy gives not that name to duellists and honor sanctifies their bloody deeds   lady cyp away with all such honor truth disavows it nature revolts from it religion denounces it  oh he is born to be my shame and torment   sir oliv be patient for a while suspend your judgment   lady cyp no i regard a duellist with horror i hold him as an agent of the enemy of mankind sent to disturb society and rend the parents and the widows hearts asunder one action one only action and that a doubtful one had met my ear in favor of that wretch whom i call nephew and henceforth even that one i totally discredit and renounce him   sir oliv hold i conjure you in the midst of wrath let us remember justice i like you abhor a duellist professed yet i am taught by long experience how to make allowances for younger spirits and warmer passions that will not submit to meet the worlds contempt and scorn its prejudices   lady cyp away you talk this language by profession reason declares against it   sir oliv reason demands that we should pause in judgment when two men draw their swords upon each other reason will tell us one must be to blame but ere we six the blame upon that one justice decrees that we should hear them both   lady cyp what says your nephew he will speak the truth   sir oliv i should expect he would yet i will not wholly trust to any mans report against another in his own cause and in this sentiment my nephew honorably coincides for he declines all answer to my questions and will state nothing to affect or criminate his antagonist  hah who is this   algernon enters lady cyp go go i did not send for you   alg i know it but i wish to speak in private with sir oliver montrath   sir oliv with me who is this man i do not know him is he one of your ladyships domestics   lady cyp no he made offer of his services but upon talking with him i perceived he had a list of grievances to state and not being then at leisure i believe i told him he might wait your coming and make his suit to you   sir oliv and so he may  his looks plead in his cause is it your wish to speak with me young man   alg it is   sir oliv

what this man can have to tell me do you conjecture   lady cyp there is a mystery about him he says he is a gentleman by birth and so far i believe him of what he had to tell besides i waved the hearing but offered him relief that did not seem his object nor was it mine to take a gentleman into my service but you will know the whole  shall we adjourn and see what is become of emily   sir oliv

misfortune   lady cyp i hope you have also pity for the sufferer   emily i trust i have for all that merit it   earl i am sure miss emily will not attempt to extenuate the guilt of such an action   emily you may be sure i never will defend a guilty person knowing him for such be you as careful how you criminate an absent man till you have proofs against him to sir oliver sir you are silent i should wish to know if you have any thing to urge against him   sir oliv nothing my dear i am listening with attention and therefore silent i should be sorry were you less unwilling to give up your opinion of a man who rendered you such service   lady cyp what service earling you have heard the story let us hear what you have to say upon it   earl if miss fitzallan will suffer me to put a simple question to her   emily by all means put your question   earl when mr algernon by happy chance came in so opportunely to her rescue can miss fitzallan say what brought him thither so far from his own home   emily i never asked what caused him to be there nor did he tell me   earl well call it then a very happy chance without a cause or a most fortunate presentiment that somewhere in that grove there would be found a damsel in the power of some vile ruffian whom he was doomed to rescue some people might suppose this a collusion but miss fitzallan can remove all doubts by telling us who was the villain that offered her that violence   sir oliv can you do this my emily   emily i cannot   earl did mr algernon know who he was   emily i do not think he did   earl did he secure his person   emily no his care was wholly turned to me the man he left upon the ground and as it seemed disabled   earl i have done i leave it to the court to judge   lady cyp a barefaced trick it is too palpable   sir oliv who can say that  let mr algernon speak for himself   earl speak   sir oliv aye you have spoke and should not he that is justice is it not   earl did you always find it so where you have been sir oliver   sir oliv whether i found it so or not i felt it   emily now mr earling you may put those questions you have pressed on me to mr algernon perhaps he will answer them   lady cyp emily emily you forget yourself   emily madam i should if i forbore to speak when charges such as these are urged against an absent therefore a defenseless man you have not allowed him to approach you madam this gentleman equally unknown to him prejudges him at once he is ingenious to find out bad motives for good actions there is not a virtue in the human heart but may be metamorphosd by such cunning into a vice sir oliver has said and said it in the language of a hero  let mr algernon speak for himself   sir oliv and i repeat those words  let him be heard  however circumstances bear against him and wretched though he has made me still i hold it matter of conscience never to prejudge however strong the grounds of my suspicion   lady cyp sir oliver we do not think alike and therefore with your leave well cut this subject short emily will retire  a little recollection will be useful to show the error of some rash opinions and amend them go child remember i have now a right to look for the obedience of a daughter   emily and i to expect the mildness of a mother   exit lady cyp and now sir oliver with your permission i will dispatch a little business with my agent and leave you to

with his son the person whose unlucky chance it was to wound your nephew   sir oliv and what is your motive for the question that you now put to me   alg i am no stranger to your character and if you know the circumstances of that duel i trust you will not suffer mr earling to misrepresent them to the lady cypress   sir oliver certainly i should not if i knew the truth suffer it to be disguised but i have no particulars from my nephew the affair remains a mystery can you develope it   alg if lady cypress will permit me to stay this night as she has promised and you can bring me to an explanation with her in your presence i can so far elucidate this mystery that if you still persist to trace it home you shall have full possession of the means   sir oliv i hardly should expect it at your hands nor where my nephews honor is concerned shall i be easily induced to listen to other evidence than that of facts incontrovertibly attested and i am free to say admitted on his part   alg it is to such facts and such authorities i shall appeal   sir oliv and do you mean to criminate my nephew   alg pardon me sir i have no other meaning but to declare the truth   sir oliv have you the

mournful you know not what you say   simon pardon me pardon me most incomparable lady a festival it must be because you are pleased to order us to be merry  mournful it surely is because your attorney makes us sad   lady cyp you see he is in my interest and you are all in league against him   simon no no no my lady it is not because he is in your interest we are leagued against him  your interest has been ever dearer to me than my own if you turn me out of your doors this night i can lay my hand upon my heart and appeal to the giver of it that i never wronged you of a farthing and though a poor servant scorn to cringe and lie and vilify an absent man as he has done madam you are abused the county would rise up against him if they knew what he has said of mr algernon  so much is your nephew beloved   lady cyp come come i know who tells you so  it is henry scudamore and no one else   simon pray madam be no more deceived but hear and judge for yourself if it was the last word i had

exeunt severally scene changes earling enters earl where is this henry scudamore i have hunted the whole house over for the fellow if he is not driven out before this night my post will not be tenable

the whole swarms upon me and i must stand their buzzing as for their stings i am not in fear of them so long as i can keep the queen of the hive in my possession  algernon enters oho i have lit upon

lady cypress when she sends her warning by a proper messenger i will obey her   earl why who am i what do you take me for   alg a wretch beneath my notice  a defamer   simon enters simon well met friend henry it is my ladys orders that you dont leave the house till she has seen you   earl sot you are drunk you never had such orders   simon i had no orders  very well and i am a sot i am drunk  why very well  so much for me now for yourself  you are no sot youre sober mr earling the attorney youre never drunk for no man will drink with you you never make mistakes about your orders for you are under orders from the old one never to speak the truth and faithfully adhere to your instructions   earl this to my face   simon oh yes i never saw a face better entitled to the compliment i only wish to see it face to face with harry algernon and then perhaps your face may be promoted where i may treat it with an egg or two   alg go go unhappy man it cannot be pleasant to hear yourself described so faithfully   earl i will not go  i summon you before the lady cypress  she will do me justice  she will avenge my wrongs here comes sir oliver  i appeal to him   sir oliver enters sir oliv what is the matter   earl these fellows have insulted me most grossly   sir oliv you are a lawyer you have your redress   earl sir it is above redress by any law   sir oliv then put it up and seek redress from patience that is a remedy for all complaints   earl i hope i have better remedies than patience  i warrant i will exterminate these insolents i will pluck em root and branch out of this house and hurl em to the dunghill that they sprung from   sir oliv go then and set about it leave me sir i have business with this gentleman   earl this gentleman forsooth this gentleman    exit simon well he may be a gentleman for me only he lets the bottle stand too long and takes no pity on his company that wish to give it motion  that is not quite like a gentleman methinks  else he may be a sober sort of a gentleman  but not a lord  no no at least he will never be as drunk as a lord   exit sir oliv now sir i have seen my nephew since we last conversed you asked me then if i had been informed of the particulars of that rencontre and by the motives you assigned for the enquiry i should suppose you know some circumstances of that dark affair   alg the whole correctly   sir oliv indeed i hardly should have thought that mr algernon would have revealed the whole to any but his nearest and most confidential friend   alg nor has he it remains still in his bosom an inviolable secret though known to me   sir oliv you mean to say that secrets in your keeping are secure i have my nephews story as you have algernons and should be glad with your consent to compare them with each other   alg they cannot differ for my account is drawn up by your nephew and being signed by him he neither can nor will depart from it   sir oliv you much amaze me sir that mr algernon should give a paper of such consequence out of his hand i greatly wish to see it   alg would it relieve your mind at the same time to see and talk with algernon himself   sir oliv oh infinitely if i could obtain it   alg then with a man of honor twoud be mean to trifle any longer  i am algernon   sir oliv how  algernon  may i believe you    alg you shall not doubt me  there is your nephews paper  no eye but yours has seen it from my hand   sir oliv sir  mr algernon  i ask your pardon  i am satisfied  but can you be unknown and in this house   alg i never entered it before this day nor to my knowledge ever saw my aunt till i appeared before her in this habit which i shall now put off  but hark we shall be interrupted here  cannot we retire to a more private place   sir oliv to my apartment  if you will be pleased to follow me  ah sir ah mr algernon how hard to find now at the close of a long life of services all it is enjoyments all it is labors lost   end of act iv act v scene the castle hall jerry scud and jenny scud well well well jewel jenny here we are for the last time farewell visits to be sure are melancholy matters but we have many good friends in the castle still and though i am thrown out of the cabinet i have kept up my interest in the kitchen   jenny aye and in the county too when it shall be known that you have forfeited my ladys favor by speaking up for mr algernon he is so much pitied and beloved by all men that your neighbors will sham sick on purpose to employ you   scud to say the truth i have sometimes thought that was my ladys only complaint but i took care my physic should not cure her of it and my comfort is that nobody of the faculty will profit by my loss for when she leaves off my medicines she will find herself too well to employ a doctor   jenny come come jerry she will not leave off you nor your medicines if you can get to the speech of her a little coaxing and a submissive apology will set all things right   scud no no jewel jenny she will hear no apology and therefore i have expressed myself more at large in my bill  here it is here it is  it is a bouncer is not it   jenny yes marry if she has patience to go through this she will find you have enough to say for yourself but i suspect jerry this argument is a little too much on one side   scud turn over the leaf and you will find a great deal more on the other side  simon single and mrs dorothy buckram ah my good friends my good friends this is the most doleful visit i ever made to the castle jenny can witness i have passed a sleepless night that incubus of an attorney rode upon me like he nightmare   buck rode indeed set a beggar on horseback and where will he not ride   scud i attempted to put a cracker under his tail but it burst in my hand and i only burnt my own fingers without singing him   simon let him go the road he travels is all downhill and when he comes to his journeys end he will find those that will put crackers enough under his tail i warrant me   dor as for me a jackdaw in a cage has a better life of it than i have for he may cry rogue and not be chidden for it  we shall all be turned away i lay my account to be sent going for one   simon thirty years i have passed within these walls and i would sooner pass the rest of my days within the walls of a prison than live in a house where scurrility is caressed and plain speaking turned out of doors  hah who comes here   algernon enters in his own dress buck bless the good mark our henry  no  yes sure it is henry how comes this to pass   alg i am ordered to attend upon my lady so i put on my best   simon hark ye my friend if it is not your own bad is your best let us have no false feathers where did you get this suit   alg it is harry algernons he and i wear the same clothes one tailor serves us both  is not it true jerry   scud it is it is and the same measure fits you   simon i dont know what you mean   alg then i will inform you here are but two of you in company that do not know me you are both my friends my generous zealous friends for which i thank you and come in person hither to convince you that algernon is not that worthless man which calumny has painted him to be   buck heavens grace light on you if indeed you are that injured gentleman   scud oh by my soul he is the very man you may take that upon my word for truth   simon i saw it i said it i knew he was a gentleman now we have got that attorney in a trap   jenny yes yes he will make that earling shrink into his hole   simon hang him polecat i will smoke him out of it oh the inconceivable lies that miscreant has told of a gentleman he does not know even by sight i pray you sir dont discover yourself to him till we have had him up before my lady  methinks i hear her say simon i am convinced that lawyer is a rascal  turn him out   buck aye well all lend a helping hand to that   scud yes or a helping foot if that is wanted i have one at his service   simon bless you my worthy master bless you heartily i hope i have said nothing to affront you i was a little by the head just now but that is over   alg so is not my remembrance i shall ever prize you as my best of friends   simon lord love you we are all your friends we are all algernons and anti earlings   buck and when the election comes well wear your colors   scud only put me in office on that day let me be surgeongeneral to the enemy and i will engage they shall have more freeholders in the hospital than at the hustings i will scour their consciences i warrant me   alg now my good friends keep secret what has passed and wait the event in silence  here comes one a gentle advocate whom i would fain speak to apart   simon we are gone we are gone all happiness befall you   exeunt all but algernon emily fitzallan enters emily bless me you have changed your habit   alg yes my charmer  in chase it is lawful to hang out false colors but when we are cleared and going into action we must show what we are   emily right and where truth unfolds her standard victory must follow   alg and what should follow victory what but the glorious prize for which i struggle that prize which fortune aiming to impoverish has only made more rich in my esteem  that generous heart that sacrificed for me interest for which so many sacrifice themselves now call to mind those words so heavenly sweet which you left with me whilst the ingenuous blush glowed on your cheek  henry i live for you   emily ah that was then the only way i had to reinstate you in your property and though it cost a blush to say those words still i could say them for i scorned to rob you  but to repeat them now would be  oh heaven  it would be every thing but false my henry   alg then let me take that truth into a heart of which no human power can dispossess you   emily i hope not henry for take that away and i am poor indeed   alg it is yours for ever  and believe me dear one if my too credulous aunt has not outlived her reason she will see the injustice of her own decisions and revoke them for my exclusion she may have some plea our families have been at suit for years and law will cut asunder closer ties than those existing between her and me but of her motives for discarding you take my word emily she will soon repent   emily it is not that i fear her worthless favorite the wretch has brought a storm upon his head and has already had some heavy shocks  but my worst fears point to another quarter   alg i understand you it is montrath you dread   emily i could not temporize i spoke too plainly indignant of the claim she made upon me i set her power too boldly at defiance and challenged her to cancel her bequest   alg you must consult sir oliver upon this i cannot speak upon montraths affair even to you   emily i see you either cannot or you will not therefore i ask no questions well persuaded you never would take arms against the life of any man and know yourself in fault   alg i hope i shall not be found to have so done  but look here comes sir oliver  i will leave you he may perhaps be less reserved than i am   exit algernon sir oliver montrath enters sir oliv was not that algernon   emily you know him sir it seems    sir oliv i think i do i have cause to know him   emily ah sir you speak so mournfully i fear you have found no comfort in your visit to your nephew   sir oliv small comfort  yet the danger of his wound is much abated   emily then i am afraid you have or think you have some cause of anger against algernon   sir oliv no emily no anger against him you cannot think too well of algernon though i could wish you had not put your thoughts in language quite so warm   emily twas indiscreet but that defamer urged me and put me off my guard   sir oliv could not you find another and a stronger cause that put you off your guard is there not a certain passion which our hearts are subject to that neither keeps a guard upon itself nor suffers any to be kept against it   emily if i should answer that as truth would prompt me shoudnt i expose myself to another reproof for want of caution   sir oliv no for so far from thinking with my lady that you have chosen ill i think with you that you could no where make a better choice  and more than this  was your brave father living and knew what i know of your algernon he would approve your judgment   emily as i am sure you would not give that name but to a sacred truth what you have said sanctions the character of algernon  but does it warrant me in suffering him to make a sacrifice of interest by marrying a beggar   sir oliv you point the question wrong and should have asked if it exculpates me your fathers friend for suffering you to call yourself a beggar  no my dear child it does not nor will i permit it to be said the daughter of the generous fitzallan who in the battle found me faint with wounds and whilst he covered me received his death wanted that dross which i abounded in  this emily this never should be said so come with me and dont oppose one word to my resolves for in an act of honor i will pause at no mans bidding no my pretty one nor yet at any womans though graced with all the charms that heaven can give her   exeunt scene changes earling alone now fortune one kind lift and i am landed so far success goes with me i have nothing more to fear from emily that pert proud miss is silenced and thrown by it now remains to sweep those menial vermin out my way those insects that annoy me old sir oliver that blusters about justice is a hypocrite he cannot be a friend to algernon and yet he troubles me takes up my seat at table occupies the ear of the old lady and obstructs my suit which stood so fair that if i could but seize one lucky moment one fair opportunity  hah i have found it  here she comes alone  now impudence befriend me   lady cypress enters lady cyp so mr earling much as i love peace i will not purchase it by mean concessions i will not suffer the gentleman i esteem and trust to be affronted by my saucy servants they shall atone or troop   earl most amiable most excellent of ladies whom with my heart i serve honor obey and worship i want words to speak my gratitude  thus at your feet in humble adoration let me seal on this dear hand the pledge the sacred pledge of my unutterable my unbounded love   simon and dorothy enter simon look dorothy the devils at his prayers   dor i hope they are his last prayers   earl curse on their coming what a moment lost madam do you permit your menial servants thus to break in upon your private moments   lady cyp why not if you have any thing to add to your last speech i shall not interrupt it you may resume your posture and go on   earl madam i cannot   lady cyp i can help your memory if you have lost the word twas love unbounded love when you had gone so far out of all bounds all measure of respect can the appearance of these silly people deter you from proceeding   earl madam if youre offended i have done i will humbly take my leave   lady cyp no sir i must insist upon your staying though you are foiled to add a single word to insolence so perfect and complete yet you shall not be robbed of your just right that nature gives you to be heard in vindication of your own assertions if you have spoke the truth and nothing but the truth of algernon his character cannot be rescued let the fate of yours be what it may   simon any thing the matter mr attorney afraid you are not quite well just now you look a little pale   lady cyp hold your tongue foolish fellow you simon in the first place and you next mistress who dare to tell me i am made the dupe of false impressions are you not both ashamed to look this injured gentleman in the face   simon it is a face to make a man ashamed and we did blush to see him on his knees before your ladyship   lady cyp that is my affair fall down on yours and ask forgiveness of him   simon pray madam dont command me to do that for fear i never should forgive myself  i ask your pardon for approaching you when i was tipsey but you bade me drink and i was over eager to obey you   lady cyp that is easily forgiven but your abuse of this gentleman whom i must still call the friend of truth is monstrous   simon madam if that gentleman is the friend of truth he makes very free with his friend truly i only said he told lies to your ladyship that is no abuse for here come those an prove it   sir oliver montrath and emily earl my evil genius what does he do her   sir oliv forgive me my good lady if i come to atone to you and this fair advocate for my unjust suspicions of your nephew i have one here waiting who will confront that gentleman his accuser and i trust remove some false impressions that your ladyship may have imbibed from his unfounded charges come in sir if you please   algernon enters lady cyp how now who is this henry   sir oliv i claim your promise to give him hearing   earl i protest against him that fellows an impostor we shall not listen to his evidence   lady cyp he first came here humbly to ask for service pleaded decay and said he was a gentleman by birth i pitied him and offered him relief he now has changed his dress shifted his character and claims to be an advocate for algernon these are suspicious circumstances and i should have some better reasons for believing him than i am yet possessed of do you know any such sir oliver   earl aye sir do you know who this champion is   sir oliv sir give me leave to ask  do you   earl not i i know him not   sir oliv yet you know algernon are intimate with all his habits frailties faults offenses  have looked into his heart and kindly told the secrets you discovered  oh thou slanderer now look him in the face and prove your charge  well may you start  mark his confusion madam  this is your nephew this is algernon   emily yes on my honor and my brave preserver   lady cyp i am confounded  where is that defamer   simon madam he has stepped aside to mend a flaw in his indictment  how do you do mr attorney come forward if you please and get acquainted with this gentlemans face you knew him well enough behind his back   lady cyp peace let me hear what algernon will say in his own cause   sir oliv speak for yourself brave algernon   alg i am that exiled man whom on the word of this defamer though unknown to him even by sight it seems you have proscribed despairing of admission to your presence and driven in selfdefence on this resource i took a counterfeited character and saw what i had never been allowed to approach  your person much i wished to speak in mitigation of your prejudice and give a plain recital of my wrongs but you had then no ear for such discourse and i was told to wait your better leisure   lady cyp all this is true  proceed   alg a friend here present told me i was accused to you of various crimes and gross enormities i plead to failings to the common errors and indiscretions youth is subject to but i trust i have never degraded my character or debased my principle i am no gamester as he makes me to be no dissipater of my paternal fortune as he insinuates no libertine as he asserts and let me add in the hearing of sir oliver montrath i am no assassin   sir oliv it is now my duty and a painful one i feel it to bring to light in vindication of an injured character the guilty person for whose shameful act no better palliation can be found than temporary madness and intoxication the monster from whose brutal violence the purest of heavens creatures was preserved by algernon how shall i speak it without shame and horror was lionel montrath   lady cyp i am confounded and amazed montrath  this if not told by you sir oliver would mock belief   sir oliv your nephew was too noble to disclose it though he has in his hands a written paper signed by the offender for his vindication this i believe he never has discovered even to that lady though a party in it   emily never but constantly evaded my enquiries   sir oliv to this when i shall add that my rash nephew forced the duel on him in consequence of blows exchanged between them i trust i may with safety rest his cause upon the facts adducd  unless indeed this gentleman has any other charge which in his modesty he will prefer   earl you will not draw any thing from me sir oliver you may talk on i prefer silence   sir oliv you are right it is time your tongue had some repose   lady cyp pray do not keep him longer in my sight my nephew does not seem to hold him worthy of a retort   alg no madam i have nothing to return him for his malicious slander but my contempt   lady cyp if he can feel it is punishment enough   sir oliv be gone your infamy go with you and may no part of it adhere to your profession   earl let my profession look to itself  there are some understandings in this world made it should seem by nature to be duped had you not been so easy of belief i had not been so forward to deceive you now put what name you will upon my conduct there are such glaring instances in point of dealers in seduction infamy and false impressions on credulity as make my shame no wonder   exit lady cyp now henry you have appealed to me for justice  hear my decree there is your destiny that is the prize which you have nobly earned my heart so long estranged is now your own you are my son and emily my daughter all i possess is yours  have i atoned   alg oh you have given me that which might atone for all the pains mortality could feel  beauty to charm me talents to enchant and truth to fix my happiness secure   emily oh henry bear me to my benefactress and let me kneel    lady cyp yes i will let you kneel my child for now thou have a treasure worth thy thanks  be virtuous loving faithful to each other ape not the

your fair wife are welcome she is a child of the castle and will grace our dance   scud yes under favor jenny though i say it has all the steps that now are thought so graceful she will balance on one leg and send the other upon a cruize into her neighbors pocket no magnetizing doctor or dotterellmonger can surpass my jenny for the fine attitudes   lady cyp youre a strange mortal but let mirth go
