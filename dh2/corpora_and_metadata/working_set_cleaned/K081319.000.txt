the two connoisseurs a comedy in rhyme written for a private theater by william hayley esquire  calcutta printed in the year mdcclxxxv  persons of the drama lord seewell mr beril mr bijou mr cycle tom careless harry servant to mr beril mr varnish lady harriot daughter of lord seewell lady frances the same mrs bijou joan the two connoisseurs act the first scene i  chambers in the temple tom careless and mr cycle careless whatever the success of your journey may be my dear rural sage you are welcome to me your benevolent projects i hope you will complete by this trip from your snug scientific retreat in return for amusement you have given me there by your fine apparatus and lectures on air i will show you the town and the town is a science  mr cycle on my tutor dear tom i have a perfect reliance for i know in that study what vigils you have kept  careless it is the only one truly where i am an adept for as to the law that is the science of thorns and though its black robe my lean figure adorns perhaps twice a year for my fathers good pleasure i have renounced i confess both its toil and its treasure from my sapient lord coke this advantage i gain he led me to find out a flaw in my brain that title on which as wise parents have done my father laid claim to the seals for his son  mr cycle such language dear tom is in truth but a brogue that betrays the young heir as an indolent rogue it is the cant of ye all  ye want talents to drudge  careless well think me my friend wise enough for a judge i still must rejoice i have nothing to do as my heart now inclines me to wait upon you i wish i could raise you the cash you require but you know i depend on a closehanded sire who promises largely and often has said he will make me a croesus whenever i wed but to drive me i think to the conjugal state keeps the purse of the bachelor woefully strait and guineas at present are scarce to my sorrow how much are you now come to london to borrow two thousand do you say  mr cycle yes two thousand at least and perhaps rather more as my plan is increased i wish for no profit but public esteem and much good to the world must arise from my scheme  careless well i wish you may prosper but as i am a sinner i as soon should expect a roast phoenix for dinner as in times like the present such loans from a friend when opulence has not a stiver to lend you philosophers look with contempt upon cash but the fools of this town are so fond of the trash that as youre a chemist both skilful and bold you had best try to make a few odd lumps of gold and this newlyfound art you may try with less cost since to borrow with ease seems an art that is lost  mr cycle dear careless youre welcome to rally my hopes so attack them with all your rhetorical tropes the man is illwrapt in philosophys cloak whose bosom is ruffled dear tom by a joke i know moneys scarce yet i will not despond i have two friends who will supply what i want on my bond  careless what two such good friends so rich open and free dear cycle i pray introduce them to me for not one of that cast my long list can produce why man such a friend is the goldeneggd goose you may hunt for the bird even as long as youre able but at last you will find it is only a fable i wanted but one hundred pounds the other day and asked fifty friends that chance threw in my way but they all shook their heads with a negative nod so i dunnd my old father in spite of the rod but pray do i know the good creatures you mean  mr cycle aye both  they are two friends whom for years i have not seen but in juvenile days i held each as my brother and i trust that we all are still dear to each other youre acquainted with beril   careless well there i confess your wishes have some little chance of success if there is one in the world who regardless of pelf would relieve a friends wants though he straightened himself you have now named the man yet perhaps he cannot lend i know he has suffered by aiding a friend and i fancy he has but a slender estate it is true he dont play though carest by the great yet in statues and books he is expensive it is said  i have seen him bid high for a porphyry head  mr cycle it is hard fortune still should torment him with crosses i soothed him to bear the severest of losses i was with him when blasted in youths blooming charm his lovely sophia was torn from his arms you knew not i think that unfortunate fair the victim of cruelty love and despair she was bound to our friend by a mutual affection but her rich sordid parents opposed the connection the canker of sorrow incessantly preyed on the perishing bloom of the delicate maid her duty her sufferings made nature relent and wrung from her father a tardy consent but death rendered vain the late sanction he gave and his childs bridal bed was the pitiless grave many years have now softened the lovers wild grief perhaps some new beauty now yields him relief he is still single i think  careless yes in learning and art he has sought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart hence a pleasing mild elegance runs through his life and had i a sister i would wish her his wife  but now for your second friend  what is his name for acquaintance with him too i will certainly claim you say that i know him come tell me who is it  mr cycle yes indeed it is one whom you frequently visit and here you must own that my hopes are well founded since in kindness and wealth he has ever abounded and a legacy lately   careless you dont mean bijou that collector of knickknacks  mr cycle indeed tom i do i have a title to ask any favor from him he has some little vanity some little whim yet still he is a friendly benevolent man  careless you may rap at his door  but get in if you can your friend when you saw him was jocund and free his heart full of bounty his spirit of glee his vanities too had so mirthful a cast that friendship herself even wished them to last but marriage that changer of mind and of feature has made poor bijou quite a different creature  mr cycle i am told that his wife with a pocket well laden was a little fat ancient and wellbehavd maiden who having a similar taste for virtu put her cabinet under the care of bijou  careless yes indeed in an odd fit of amorous hunger he married an old curiositymonger who is ready to faint if a visitor knocks while she is brushing the dust from her rareeshew box her maid the other day threw her into a swoon by cracking the eye of a great stuffed baboon for instead of young children whose troublesome noise might disturb their sedate virtuosical joys she fills their fine house with new monsters or mummies  mr cycle of your story dear tom i perceive what the sum is you dont like the lady  she may not please you and yet be an excellent wife for bijou i am told she has really much merit and taste in her morals they say she is remarkably chaste so with lectures perhaps she has wounded your ear and you rakes of the temple may think her severe  careless no faith with the lady i stand very well i bought her esteem with an old empty shell i own she has piety morals and sense to chastity no one will doubt her pretense but though with these virtues i freely invest her my heart i confess is inclined to detest her she has ruined her husband  at least so i think to a dwarf she has made his benevolence shrink and puffed up his vanity into a giant to all her strange whims he is so servilely pliant he would obey her caprice whatsoever it might hint and deny himself bread to buy her an odd flint  mr cycle why tom that is a proof of his fond tender heart  careless to me it proves naught but her ladyships art and so you yourself would explain the whole riddle if you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle as a more wretched brush never blotted poor paper and never squeakd a cremona beneath a worse scraper though pampered with flattery thus by his wife our friend has quite lost all his humor and life and whenever i look on his cold chearless face as he stands by the side of his wifes fossilcase i think her a perfect medusa i own who has turned her poor husband himself into stone  mr cycle you loungers dear tom in your idle disputes love to ridicule all lifes amusing pursuits but they all have their use and the lady who joys in collecting an odd set of whimsical toys is herself a rare gem that my judgment regards more than all the fair votaries of scandal and cards i know i shall like her in spite of your stricture and i am going to see how you have failed in her picture my old friends good will i shall put to the trial and solicit his aid without fear of denial  careless come along  i will see if your welcome is hearty indeed i may serve you by joining the party and i am eager to know for my portrait is true what you think of the change she has wrought in bijou to a knowledge of nature i never will pretend if when you have seen in the house of our friend all the natural rarities ranged in a glass you dont rank his heart in the petrified class exeunt  scene changes to a drawing room at mrs bijou s with a door open into an interior cabinet of curiosities  several stuffed creatures and other rarities discovered in the apartment joan with a brush lackaday would i once were well out of this house where i tremble to move full as much as a mouse and nannys afraid to come into this room indeed the poor creature can scarce hold a broom for my mistress she says has done nothing but bait her since she brushed off the tail of the new alligator i have a great mind to lay up my brush on the shelf and leave madam to dust all her monsters herself would my master would make her for these stocks and stones a young little plaything of good flesh and bones but alas these old ladies who cannot raise a baby are as full of nonsensical maggots as may be and our house is so crammed with this whimsical jumble that if you touch one thing another will tumble madam says i misplace whatsoever i clean but i will venture to wipe off the dust from this screen throws it down a plague take the things they do nothing but fall lud my fingers have run through the cover and all taking up the screen and uncovering it it is my masters new drawing  how madam will thunder  this fine naked beauty i have torn quite asunder and the rent must be seen  i can thrust my whole thumb in and i have no time to mend it  my mistress is coming   mrs bijou entering in a dark brown bedgown with a brush of peacocks feathers some new mischiefs done here  lord joan what is the matter i am sure you broke something  i heard such a clatter  joan indeed maam i have had a most cruel disaster the screen   mrs bijou what the beautiful work of your master  joan my finger slipped through as i wiped it in haste but i am sure i can mend it again with some paste  mrs bijou you awkward pert hussy pray let it alone can paste mend a flaw in a goddesss zone ye stars give me patience  get out of this door and pray let me never set eyes on you more i knew i should suffer as soon as you came for taking a thing with so gothic a name  joan i will go  for i live but the life of a cur yet pray on my name do not throw any slur i am sure it is good english although it is joan and that is more than youre able to say of your own exit  mr bijou entering what is the matter my dear  what new plague from your maids you for ever are vexed by these pestilent jades if bred in this town you object to their morals if rusties they break all your glasses or corals let em come whence they will they bring trouble and strife and your quarrels have made me half sick of my life  mrs bijou dont say so  you know my dear mr bijou i take no young maids out of fondness to you and these middleagd creatures are all so unhandy they make me as fretful as old mr shandy but my dear if you see me sometimes in a flame i think you will not say that my tempers to blame twas my love for the works of your delicate hand which produced an emotion i could not command if i rated old joan in a great agitation i am sure you will own i had much provocation when you see this sad cause of the bustle between us she has utterly ruined your very best venus this new lovely drawing the joy of all eyes i vow i could cry   mr bijou what sweet softness  she cries  these feelings indeed prove the true connoisseur this ill treatment of art her fine sense cannot endure henceforth of my works let them say what they will no painter can boast such a test of his skill  come cheer up my dear cognoscente come come i can mend it again with a brushfull of gum  mrs bijou do you think you can mend it  and will not it look brown if you dont hide the skin with the skirt of a gown twould be pity to cloak up a body so fine especially since you have drawn it from mine and you know i caught cold when i stripped to the waist to fit for the figure in true attic taste but i did it from fondness that you might not roam and wickedly hunt after models from home to be sure i love art  but all artists they say by their studies of nature are tempted to stray and i own that your genius gives me great alarms  mr bijou my dear tender creature pray trust your own charms  mrs bijou affectionate terrors will rise in my head i was jealous i own the other day of the dead  mr bijou what fond sensibility exquisite feeling  mrs bijou i hope i was wrong but strange fancies will steal in when fondness has opened the heart to suspicion youre so dear to the females of every condition but i hope lady fancybird was not so vicious there was nothing indeed in her air meretricous yet a jealous pang seized me i own when i found that by will she bequeathed to you three thousand pound it is true that a legacys very commodious yet the money appears to me utterly odious when i think it was possibly meant as the price of endearments to which she had art to entice and not in return for the pictures you drew of her parrot her bullfinch and old cockatoo  mr bijou lord my dear if such phantoms your quiet consume you will make the old lady jump out of her tomb it is true that i flattered her favorite passion as i love to be well with old ladies of fashion but pray dont suppose i was ever so absurd as to stroke her pale cheek for the pole of her bird  mrs bijou ah you humorous man you have such infinite wit you can turn to a jest whatsoever you think fit  but my heart on this point can be never at ease unless you will allow me to spend as i please half the money of which youre so oddly possessed and then i shall think it an honest bequest besides there is an auction at lady toytruckles and i long for a rap at the duchesss knuckles who outbid me you know the other day for a shell it is all for your credit  mr bijou well well my dear well i never refuse you the cash i can spare  mrs bijou you are sure i shall turn it to something most rare for indeed i am no pitiful hoarder of pelf and i have now set my heart on some true ancient delf  mr bijou it is time you were dressed  mrs bijou as i live there is a rap i am not fit to be seen in this bedgown and cap run and charge them my dear not to let in a soul  with my cabinet dust i am as black as a coal  mr bijou  looking out i am too late  mrs bijou for my orders they dont care a pin and to vex me old joan has let somebody in i will escape  i cannot bear to be seen in this trim  mr bijou it is only tom careless  you need not mind him  enter careless and mr cycle careless here good folks i have brought you a very rare bird it is five years since his notes in this town have been heard  mr bijou mr cycle my worthy old friend how do you do  give me leave to present to you mrs bijou  mrs bijou i am ashamed to be found in this garb  mr bijou o my dear from a man of true science you have nothing to fear he will freely allow for he is candid and just philosophical ladies must dabble in dust  mr cycle my wife is a curious collector in natural knowledge i hope you will direct her you are master of all from the earth to the stars and may aid her in ranging her fossils and spars  mr cycle she shall freely command all the little i know  mrs bijou youre extremely obliging dear sir to say so but i cannot attend you in this dusty vest i will soon slip it off  careless you shall not stir i protest to talk of your dress my dear maam is a joke to a sage who exists but in chemical smoke your robe is indeed like the robe of saint bruno yet still by your air we might take you for juno while the tail of your peacock that type of command with such dignity waves in your awful white hand  mrs bijou youre a young saucy creature  mr cycle these idle rogues madam more like sons of the serpent than children of adam are apt to esteem it a dull occupation to study the wonders of this fair creation and hence they all rally with humor illplacd those who seek for amusement in science and taste  mr bijou well said mr cycle  i am glad that virtu has found both a friend and a champion in you come and peep at my wifes philosophical treasure i hope you will survey it again at your leisure  my dear do you allow me to show your museum  i am exact in all matters of tuum and meum  mrs bijou my cycle i am sure is a privileged man  mr bijou it is open  come sir exeunt into the interior apartment  mrs bijou tell me tom if you can is not this mr cycle a man of great worth who wrote a most excellent book on the earth  careless it is the author himself and i know not what college can show his superior in virtue and knowledge he is a man of few words with a heart and a mind ever busied in schemes for the good of mankind and he now visits london in hopes to procure some support in a plan for relieving the poor  mrs bijou the poor  of their name i am alarmed at the mention mr cycle indeed may have no ill intention but i fear he will involve my good husband in trouble  these projects of charity end in a bubble the poor are ungrateful disorderly wretches who can shift for themselves by their tricks and their fetches they deserve not a learned philosophers thought  careless your pardon  he will think if he thinks as he ought that philosophy drawing from heaven her birth is the science of softening the evils on earth by your fears you have done our friend infinite wrong for though his hearts tender his judgment is strong to the projects of folly he never can stoop  philanthropys friend is not phantasys dupe  mrs bijou why careless you talk in a language quite new who could dream of a charitysermon from you  careless oh a cobbler can preach when his spirits inflamed mine is apt to blaze forth if i hear a friend blamed and indeed i cannot stifle my hearts ebullitions when such good folks as you harbor vile suppositions but i am sure you will forgive all the warmth i have shown when the worth of our friend is to you better known if youre angry i know that your anger will cease when you hear on what terms i can purchase my peace a shell i can bring you  my interest such is  very like what you lately gave up to the duchess perhaps i may give it you   mrs bijou youre a good soul  as large as her graces and perfectly whole  careless yes i think it is as large and in color as high  mrs bijou are you sure of its shape  careless do you question my eye i will convince you i am right let us instantly look at the fine colored plates in your great danish book  mrs bijou come  you give me more joy than i am able to speak  i cannot bear that her grace should possess an unique  they retire into the interior apartment from whence mr bijou and mr cycle return mr bijou this scheme my good friend does you honor indeed in a business so noble i hope you will proceed and may you accomplish your utmost desires in raising the sum which your project requires  pray look at this new little drawing of mine dont you think it an elegant pretty design  mr cycle very lively indeed  but my friend you forget what i have said on the point of incurring this debt do not fly from the subject  i hate all evasion i must say for your aid i have serious occasion you know what i have asked and in asking i deem that i give you a proof of my cordial esteem in a poorhouse myself i would rather work hard than apply thus to one whom i did not regard  mr bijou mr cycle i know youre a man without guile and you think in a noble and singular style but if asking for cash is of love a sure test with affectionate friends all the wealthy are blessed  mr cycle i have done as i see that you wish to evade a request that i thought i with justice had made as you know when of fortune you felt a reverse you had once the command of my prosperous purse and since you of opulence now are possessed more enriched too of late by a friendly bequest i supposed without trouble   mr bijou dear cycle it is true you shall have it but mum toward mrs bijou  mr cycle o i now understand all the cause of demur and if that is the case i have done my dear sir at the hazard of discord the sum you shall not lend in family strife i will not plunge my old friend  mr bijou do not think me a slave  there is no danger of strife but you will find if you ever try the conjugal life it is best not to waken the frowns of a wife besides there is surely no reason why you should talk on such business to mrs bijou  mr cycle there is certainly none  you shall do as you please  mr bijou one thousand my friend i can spare you with ease it is the sum i shall go to receive very soon if you will call here again you shall have it by noon and to tell you the truth i would have you make haste lest my wife should demand it for matters of taste when an auction is near she is apt to be rash in laying her hand upon all my loose cash and as she is thought so judicious a buyer her elegant wishes i seldom deny her yet it is time to grow prudent  but hush here they come remember my charge  dear philosopher mum  enter mrs bijou and careless mrs bijou o my dear i am in raptures my young friend has cured all the bitter vexation i have lately endured now in shells by the duchess i am not surpast tom will bring me the fellow to what she bought last  mr bijou he is exceedingly kind  but my dear it grows late remember the guest whom you must not make wait old baron vanbettles appointed today your curious collection of flies to survey as some business abroad will oblige me to leave him i entreat you my dear to be dressed to receive him these friends will excuse you  mrs bijou i will bid them farewell mr cycle your servant  remember the shell exit  mr bijou o my friend you have a thousand new drawings to see  i can tell you our artists grow jealous of me  joan entering hastily sir a coach is just stopped and a man with a star on   mr bijou ods life i must leave you to wait on the baron  mr cycle i beg we may not keep you  mr bijou my good friends adieu dear cycle pray meet me again here at two i am sorry i am forced thus to part with you now but for such an engagement i am sure you will allow for the slies are all ranged in the parlour below and a guest like the baron one cannot leave you know as the keys in the case he perhaps might unlock it and whip the best butterfly into his pocket it is a law with the curious to watch a collector and you never must trust him without an inspector exit  careless now my friend what do you say to the portrait i drew were my colors too dark for good madam bijou but how have you sard in your moneypetition if you get it i will call you a mighty magician i can tell you that madam suspected a plot  mr cycle i have his promise  but shall i accept it or not  careless if you can by all means  twill be saved from her clutches who would throw it away in outbidding a duchess and at auctions indeed she would her husband undo were she not in her house quite a closehanded jew but on saving a penny she frequenly ponders and her avarice scrapes what her vanity squanders  o if i were her master her whimsies i would cure and make a good wife of this vile connoisseur  now for beril  he is one of a different cast  mr cycle come along  since i saw him some long years have past and i am eager to clasp his affectionate hand  careless stop a moment and answer me this one demand dont you see a sad change in our poor friend below where is the lively companion the humorous beau all his pleasantrys gone   mr cycle i confess by his carriage he seems to be rendered more serious by marriage  careless by my life i am grieved in thus seeing him grow the poor trumpeting slave to his wifes rareeshew  well ye gods if whenever my nuptial star twinkles i should wed an old hunter of odd periwinkles to engage her nice eye with unchanging attraction may i turn in her arms to a cold petrifaction  end of act i act the second scene i  an elegant apartment ornamented with a few busts and books a large statue covered up and a door open into a more extensive library mr beril and harry mr beril pray harry remove from the statue its case and be careful in clearing the dust from its base  harry directly sir  mr beril yes you must instantly do it for my worthy lord seewell is coming to view it  now my sweet lady frances i soon shall behold all thy quick sensibility wake and unfold thou will pay to this sculpture the tribute most dear thou will praise the fine work by an eloquent tear unless by gay harriot thy softness is checked how i long in thy features to mark the effect produced by the wonders of exquisite art on a delicate mind and a sensible heart but why on thy graces do i rashly dwell why study those charms that i know but too well in my station it is madness to think of thy hand yet thou of all women in this lovely land thou only could fill in my desolate breast the place that my tender sophia possessed  harry  advancing there sir it is as neat as a newtwisted cord but i hope you will not sell this fine thing to my lord he is a desperate bidder for stonework i am told yet i hope you will keep it in spite of his gold  mr beril do you hope so  pray why  i should rather have thought you would rejoice if his lordship the statue had bought it would save you some trouble  harry for that i dont care why i wish you to keep it i will freely declare  i have observed since the day that poor miss sophy died and that is five years i think next bartholomewtide there is only this statue that is now in our sight in which you have seemed to take any delight and if this marble woman your heart so engages before you should sell her i would give up my wages  mr beril you are a generous lad with an excellent heart  honest harry the statue and i shall not part but i hear a coach stop  haste and let my lord in  exit harry mr beril  alone harrys warmth is affecting  it is pleasant to win a regard unconstrained from the low ranks of life which are falsely supposed full of baseness and strife how mistaken is he who incessantly raves that domestics are nothing but idiots or knaves when nature often shines with a luster most fervent in the zeal of an honest affectionate servant  enter lord seewell with lady frances and lady harriot lord seewell dear beril my girls would attend me to see either you or your statue  however that may be i know you will allow them a sight of your treasure  mr beril my lord i confess i had hopes of this pleasure and my statue henceforth i more highly shall rate since to that i am in debt for an honor so great  lady harriot that is right mr beril  i pray make it known that we come for the sake of the marble alone for though we have both a fair name as i think yet our poor reputations will instantly sink if it is said by your neighbor old lady snapfan that instead of a statue we visit a man  mr beril if on spirit and worth there is any reliance lady harriot may set every hag at defiance and force even scandal in silence to sit  if not just to her innocence awed by her wit  lady harriot my dear sir do not talk in so pleasing a tone if you do i shall not relish the silence of stone and the statuell seem dull  so pray tell us where is it pray present us to her that we are now come to visit  mr beril here is the lady you honor showing the statue  lord seewell indeed this is fine what perfect expression what strength of design  mr beril pray my dear lady frances advance to the place which will give you i think the best view of the face it is the tender alcestis just yielding her breath on the arm of her husband reclining in death and though pain over her form so much langour has thrown you may still discern beauties resembling your own  lord seewell whence came it dear beril  it is surely antique the work my good friend is undoubtedly greek i swear the laocoon is not so fine had i choice of the two this i am clear would be mine the subject more pleasing  expression still higher  this longhidden treasure where could you acquire  mr beril i owe it to chance to acknowledge the truth and a princely and brave neapolitan youth whom i luckily saved in a villainous strife from the dagger of jealousy aimed at his life the work was dug up on his fathers estate and knowing my passion for marble is great he nobly has sent me the gift in your view in return for what accident led me to do  lord seewell it is the first piece of sculpture perhaps on the earth and i hardly know how to appreciate its worth but if ever you wish to dispose of the treasure i will accept it at three thousand guineas with pleasure  mr beril my lord you now speak with that liberal spirit which you ever display when you estimate merit though i own works of art of such high estimation seem but ill to agree with my fortune and station yet these figures at present i wish to retain though the wish may appear ostentatious and vain but my lord if they ever change their master anew they shall find a more worthy possessor in you  lady harriot well ye dear connoisseurs you amaze me i own by the value you set on this sorrowful stone i indeed can believe it is a fine piece of art but to buy it for furniture  as to my part i would as soon over my house throw a sepulchres gloom and purchase from westminsterabbey a tomb  lord seewell youre a wild idle gipsy and past all correcting you have not the least relish for what is affecting  lady harriot that is your fault dear papa  but my sister you see makes ample amends for this failing in me she gazes like you with such serious delight that she is half turned to marble herself by the sight i vow it has made her unable to speak and has drawn a cold tear down her petrified cheek  lady frances pray my dear dont expose me  mr beril o seek not to hide what nature designed your chief beauty and pride  with different charms she enriches the earth to your sister she gave the sweet dimples of mirth and that each in her province no rival may find all the soft pensive graces to you she assigned  lady harriot believe me you shine mr beril most brightly in the delicate science of praising politely in which many beaux are so savagely stupid they a scalpingknife take for the weapon of cupid and to tickle one nymph basely slash every other  well dear frances how are you  lady frances indeed i cannot smother what i feel in surveying this wonder of art it has something which takes such fast hold of the heart in the faint dying wife such a fond resignation in the poor widowed husband such wild agitation such sorrow such anguish such love to alcestis  lady harriot that is true but i know the whole story a jest is and admetus i think such a shuffling poltroon that he moves me no more than the man in the moon a pitiful fellow to live in his case and let his poor wife pass the styx in his place modern husbands indeed i believe would be merry if their wives in their stead would cross over that ferry  mr beril but perhaps maam you think that no husband could find a young modern wife of alcestiss mind  lady harriot no indeed my good sir  here is my dear sister fan she would be willing to die to preserve her good man but i own for myself i should doubt and demur if i thought my spouse wished his own trip to defer though myself to his fortunes i would freely devote if we both might embark at one time in the boat i confess i should scarce be so wondrously kind as to set sail myself but to leave him behind  harry  entering two gentlemen sir wish to see you below mr careless is one  lord seewell  to mr beril harriots favorite beau  lady harriot lord papa mr beril will think me in love  mr beril  to harry let the gentlemen know we expect them above exit harry  lord seewell tom and harriot have long had flirtations together but their courtship has changeable fits like the weather the improvident girl thinking lovers are plenty declares she will not wed till she is past oneandtwenty nor even then take her beau in her charms such her trust is unless he bids fair to become a chief justice and tom is the heir of too large an estate to load his gay spirit with laws heavy weight but here comes our young lawyer to urge his own plea  enter careless and mr cycle mr beril my dear tom how do you do  my good stars can it be is it you my dear cycle my longabsent friend  mr cycle and still heartily yours  mr beril but why would you not send and of your affection afford me a proof by bespeaking your quarters here under my roof however i am happy that chance is so kind as to give me the occasion i have long wished to find to present you to one who of all men on earth is most able to judge of your genius and worth  my dear lord to your notice now let me commend the man to whose name youre already a friend behold mr cycle  lord seewell dear sir let me say that i often have wished for this fortunate day which makes me acquainted with one whom i deem so justly entitled to public esteem whose writings and life show in fairest alliance philanthropical virtue and genuine science  mr cycle my good lord these are honors far more than my due yet i own with delight i receive them from you as youre led to oerrate my poor merits i feel by this dear partial friends kind affectionate zeal  lord seewell he indeed is your friend  i regard his applause but to wish your acquaintance i have still higher cause be assured i shall think myself truly your debtor if you will give me the pleasure of knowing you better either beril or careless will guide you to me i have some things perhaps it may please you to see yet no gem i believe that is so worthy your sight as a statue which beril has just brought to light allow me to show it you   mr beril  to lady frances your tender breast my dear lady frances i fear is oppressed by this sculptured distress the mere creature of art yet too painful a scene for so feeling a heart  lady frances no indeed at first sight though it made my veins thrill and i felt through my bosom a cold icy chill that impression once over i view it again with a soothing delight unembitterd by pain  lady harriot  to careless and pray sir from which court of justice come you  careless from the worshipful court of wise madam bijou where blind as old themis she utters decrees on the price of stuffed parrots and petrified trees  lady harriot o you mischievous creature you certainly mean by the sound of her name to awaken my spleen you know that the thought of her sickens me quite and that i at her house must do penance tonight  careless then i vow i will be there if it is only to see how mortification and you may agree even that gloomy spright must appear with some grace if it lurks in the lines of so lively a face  lady harriot all my gaiety dies when her presence i come in no crampfish could give me a shock so benumbing  she is my utter aversion   lord seewell pray tell me my dear of whom do you speak in a style so severe  lady harriot of your friend dear papa your good mrs bijou  lord seewell that is ungrateful dear harriot  she is civil to you and you should not indulge a satirical vein  lady harriot you forget my dear sir how you often complain that her low little pride and nonsensical whim have reduced your old friend to a pitiful trim and i think she has made him so gloomy a slave she has pent her good man in trophonius cave such to him was the temple of hymen for after he entered its vestibule  farewell to laughter  lord seewell why harriot you really are quite acrimonious but if you call wedlock the cave of trophonius have a care if that cavern you chance to step near you love laughing too well to resign it my dear  lady harriot and therefore though wooed like the nymph of toboso i never will marry an old virtuoso who thinks himself blessed with taste science and worth because he picks up all the odd things on earth  when a passion for art or for nature is joined with a warm friendly heart and a liberal mind i respect the pure taste which that union produces free from vanitys sordid fantastic abuses though i do not possess it i see and commend such taste dear papa both in you and your friend but i view with an utter contempt i confess those who awkwardly ape what you really possess and for mrs bijou she has just as much soul as a monkey who carries queer things to its hole she with wonderful gusto half gothic half dutch like an old squirrel hides all she can in her hutch  careless an excellent portrait and true i protest for i have just had a peep at the old squirrels nest  lady harriot pray since we together her closet inspected what whimsical rarities has she collected  careless o before i could count half the baubles she buys i could tell you the name of each star in the skies her sphere is too wide for my genius to scan it but i know what she reckons her georgian planet her newlyfound star  which tonight if youre free through a glass she perhaps may allow you to see  lady harriot what wonder is this  is it flesh fish or fowl a lilliput dog or a brobdignag owl or is it a remnant from josephs odd coat  careless it is something once held by a person of note in our island and now i defy you to guess  lady harriot is it essexs ring or the ruff of queen bess or alfreds caketoaster or rizzios fiddle pray tell me  i hate to be teased by a riddle  careless in short it is a nightcap not worth half a groat which she for a guinea has luckily bought because this old fragment of worsted she vows once served as a crown for poor chattertons brows though i think we should find if we knew the whole truth that the cap was never seen by that wonderful youth  lady harriot now chatterton boast that thy illfated verse can teach antiquarians to open their purse yet had thou in misery sud for that guinea its mistress had called thee a vain rhyming ninny and proved to thy grief by the style of her giving virtuosos have little esteem for the living  lord seewell come harriot i must stop the tide of your wit though youre now on a topic you dont love to quit  to mr beril we must take our leave  many thanks for our pleasure  mr cycle remember  your first day of leisure  you shant stir my dear beril you shant leave your friend here is careless you know on the girls to attend let us see you together and shortly  adieu  lady harriot  to careless aside below let me whisper a few words to you  mr beril and mr cycle mr beril well my worthy old friend i rejoice you are here and that now you are known to that excellent peer who free from all pride affectation and vanity unites useful virtue to pleasing urbanity plain simple sincere yet of judgment refined and fond of the arts as they are friends to mankind ennobled much less by his birth than his spirit the model of honor and patron of merit but how have you done for this age and what plan for the profit of science or service of man brings you now from your favorite sequestered retreat whatever the occasion i am glad that we meet though i meant to be with you ere next summers sun  mr cycle i know my dear beril that you are not one whose welcome will suddenly sink into sorrow when i tell you i now visit london to borrow  mr beril if i am able to levy the sum you require the world can scarce give me a pleasure much higher than that of assisting a friend to whose mind i have infinite debts of a far deeper kind i can never forget what i owe to your care in the frenzy of desolate love and despair when my reason had yielded to passions wild strife your friendship alone reconciled me to life but tell me dear cycle what sum will suffice  mr cycle you must know i have lately been led to devise a scheme for the poor   mr beril my dear friend at your leisure i will hear your benevolent projects with pleasure but farther discourse you must let me prevent on the source of your wants till i know their extent for indeed i cannot rest till i am happily sure that whatever you wish i have means to procure  mr cycle not to keep you in doubt then my dear ardent friend two thousand i fancy will answer my end the one i am promised today from bijou for the other i own i have depended on you  mr beril and why not allow me to furnish the whole  poor bijou has a wife with no liberal soul if any demur in that quarter you see i entreat you to take all you wish for of me but of this more anon  here is careless returned  mr beril mr cycle and careless careless well my worthy philosopher ant you concerned to find our friend still unsupplyd with a wife thus formed as he is for the conjugal life as youre fond of new schemes for the good of the nation i will recommend one to your consideration to revive wedded love that old obsolete passion and bring honest hymen again into fashion  mr cycle in truth my dear tom i am quite of your mind there is no better scheme for the good of mankind and nothing i know that could give it more weight than the grace which our friend would bestow on that state  mr beril you are merry good friends  i subscribe to your joke  my gravitys fit for the conjugal yoke  careless i am serious indeed and have often declared that had i a sister for wedlock prepared of all men in the world if you would deign to embrace her in your arms it would make me most happy to place her but youre courted too much to be easily won he whom many are fond of can fix upon none  mr beril indeed my dear tom you are wrong on this theme  in return for a proof of your cordial esteem i will tell you the reason with frankness and truth why no nymph has supplied the lost love of my youth there is one whose mild virtue and elegant grace the dear girl i deplore in my heart might replace but my fortunes too humble for her rank of life though she may be your sister she cannot be my wife  careless would you wed lady frances  mr cycle the lady i have seen  she is like poor sophia in features and mien  mr beril you are right my dear friend  it was that very thought led my heart to attach itself more than it ought but my reason considers her rank and her station and forbids me to form any rash expectation nor would i attempt to engage her affection without the least hope of our happy connection  careless more honor than foresight you show by this strain be bold  there is nothing you may not attain  more of this when we meet  i must now say adieu  mr cycle so must i  for you know my appointment at two  mr beril but i hope my good friends you will both dine with me  mr cycle for myself i will return to you soon after three  careless i am grieved to refuse such a frank invitation but to tell you the truth  i have a kind assignation  mr beril love and pleasure attend you  careless dear beril adieu let us all meet tonight at the house of bijou exeunt  the drawing room of mrs bijou mrs bijou  speaking as she enters look over the staircase and tell me who knocks  joan entering mr varnish is come with a thing in a box  mrs bijou a thing in a box  youre a horrible goth but as youre to leave me i will stifle my wrath it is a picture you oaf  bid him bring it to me exit joan some cabinet jewel i now hope to see this intelligent varnish my patronage

bijou good varnish what is it  mr varnish an exquisite titian you never saw one in such brilliant condition  mrs bijou and what is the subject  mr varnish opening the case now maam i will display it  here is a feast for the eye that knows how to survey it here is a joseph  i never saw his like in my life and pray maam observe what a potiphars wife how chaste the design yet the colors how warm what tints in each face and what life in each form pray madam remark how he struggles to fly we hear him exclaiming no mistress not i  mrs bijou it seems very fine and has striking expression  was it ever in any great persons possession  mr varnish not a soul here has seen it except a poor peer for whom it was bought  but alas twas too dear his steward my friend  but i must not be rash and betray a good earl with more gusto than cash  our lords are all poor and so ruined my trade is i should starve were it not for you welljudging ladies there is my old lady oglenud had she a peep would certainly buy it before she would sleep but having received many favors from you i made it a point you should have the first view  mrs bijou i thank you good varnish  but what is the price  mr varnish she would give me a thousand i know in a trice and buy some companions besides if i had em but i will leave it with you for eight hundred dear madam  mrs bijou eight hundred  sure varnish that sum is too much  mr varnish dear madam observe what a delicate touch see how finely it is pencild and what preservation there is not i know such a gem in the nation and italy has not a brighter i am sure the figures so glowing the story so pure  good ladies would never have wandering spouses if they would only hang subjects like this in their houses  mrs bijou i protest your remark is ingenious and new you have gusto in morals as well as virtu  mr varnish aside i have hopes that my hint will assist our transaction for the old dame is jealous they say to distraction  mrs bijou well i own mr varnish your picture is fine  if my husband is rich it shall quickly be mine here he comes to decide it  enter mr bijou mrs bijou my dear here is a sight you are luckily come to complete my delight mr varnish has been so exceedingly kind as he knows on a titian i have long set my mind to bring me the finest i ever surveyed and as we have often befriended his trade he offers to leave it a bargain with us  mr bijou its merit or price it is vain to discuss though the picture possesses so tempting an air at present my dear i have no money to spare  mrs bijou mr varnish pray step in the parlour below our final resolve you shall presently know  mr varnish dear madam for hours i will wait on your pleasure and i beg you will note all its beauties at leisure aside as he goes out now success to the sex  be this struggle more glorious may the joseph be kind and the lady victorious  mrs bijou my dearest you will not let the picture depart when you see it has taken such hold on my heart  i really cannot rest till a titian we have got that we may have something lord seewell has not and as we expect him you know here tonight i would show him this piece with triumphant delight  mr bijou i love to indulge all your wishes my dear but i am quite out of cash   mrs bijou nay bijou i am clear you have now all i want in your pocket  come come i know you went out to receive a large sum and still have it about you  i vow i will look  here it is  here are notes in this little red book  takes out his pocketbook mr bijou indeed i must beg you that book to release  mrs bijou here are ten i declare of an hundred apiece  i will take just enough and restore you the rest  mr bijou i cannot suffer this freedom my dear i protest for the notes are not mine they belong to a friend  mrs bijou to a friend  o i guess sir to whom you would lend your slylooking guest mr cycles the man i know he was here on a borrowing plan throw your thousand away on a charity bubble and leave your poor wife to vexation and trouble  mr bijou nay my dear be not vexed  you have misunderstood the sum will be safe and the interest good  mrs bijou and what is the pitiful profit you will raise compared to the transport with which we should gaze on the picture my fondness would have you possess for reasons the purest that wife can profess unkind as you are  i have reasons above even profit and pleasure  the reasons of love it is my aim by this modest production of art to strengthen your virtue and chasten your heart if you daily survey an example so bright this model of continence ever in sight no naughty young women will tempt you to wander but your truth and your love will grow firmer and fonder  mr bijou what a tender idea  how virtuously kind what affection and taste by each other refined  mrs bijou but if for a poor and a foolish projector you can thwart a fond wife and afflict and neglect her  go go i shall weep while abroad you may roam that your charity has no beginning at home  mr bijou it begins and shall end there  i am melted my dear  you may keep all the notes  let me kiss off that tear  mrs bijou now again your my own dear delightful bijou and the titian is mine and my love will be true  exit in great haste mr bijou  alone such virtuous endearments what heart could resist yet i fear by poor cycle this sum will be missed and what shall i say for the failure  in sooth i think twill be fairest to tell him the truth and sage as he is he perhaps too has felt that gold at the breath of a woman will melt  as i live here he is and i look rather small with a pocket so empty to answer his call  enter mr cycle mr bijou mr cycle youre come and i am really confused but i know the mischance will by you be excused in notes i had got you the thousand complete they were all in this pocket   mr cycle the thieves of the street have not picked it i hope in the bustle of strife  mr bijou it was picked i confess by the hand of my wife but for reasons so pure in so tender a mode   mr cycle i am happy the sum is so justly bestowed  mr bijou i know you will forgive when i come to explain  mr cycle dear bijou let me save you at once from that pain and assure you with truth that i now really come as ready to quit as to take up the sum since berils so kind that without my desire he has offered me all that my wants can require  mr bijou i protest i am glad you have found such a friend but if you hereafter should wish me to lend i beg you will call without scruple on me  your worthy friend beril tonight we shall see and seewell in gusto the first of our earls will be here with his daughters two delicate girls to prove my good friend your forgiveness is hearty let me hope you will kindly make one of the party  mr cycle most cheerfully  mr bijou well  i am grieved i must say that i cannot detain you to dinner today but to tell you the truth when for these gala nights my wife is preparing to show her fine sights she spends so much time in adjusting her shelves that we take a cold snap in the kitchen ourselves so i am sure you will excuse it  mr cycle your reason is strong and i am sorry my friend i have intruded so long  mr bijou we have time enough yet  do not hurry away  mr cycle it really grows late  mr bijou i will not press you to stay as at night over our concert you will come to preside  i am heartily glad all your wants are supplied  mr cycle indeed i believe you my honest bijou so till night fare you well  mr bijou my dear cycle adieu  end of act ii act the third scene i lord seewell and lady harriot lady harriot dear papa dont betray me  her delicate mind would be wounded i know and would think me unkind so far from allowing what now i impart she herself little knows the true state of her heart  lord seewell believe me my dear i with pleasure survey the sisterly fondness you warmly display but you who for others so sensibly feel may here be the dupe of affectionate zeal and i hope youre mistaken  lady harriot my dear sir observe you may trace her attachment in every nerve if i name mr beril in some idle tale poor fanny will blush and as often turn pale in his absence still more and more pensive she grows yet thinks not from whence her uneasiness flows and when he returns though her pleasure is meek yet the glow of content may be seen on her cheek and her heart as if fully consold by his sight appears to repose in a tranquil delight dear papa you will perceive if you will open your eyes that from none but herself she her love can disguise one other exception perhaps we may find as i think mr beril is equally blind and robbed like herself of the talent of seeing by that diffident love which denies it own being  lord seewell i hope this attachment which neither has shown exists my good girl in your fancy alone  lady harriot why so my dear sir  should it prove as you fear i hope dear papa that you will not be severe consider the delicate frame of my sister but i know you have a heart that can never resist her if you once clearly see she has fixed her affection though she own not her wishes for such a connection as you know that her natures so modest and meek she would die from concealment before she would speak i have strength to encounter the crosses of life and to make my part good as a daughter or wife but our gentle sweet frances is illformd to bear the undeserved load of vexation and care and therefore should wed unregardful of pelf a husband as tender and mild as herself  lord seewell your reasoning i think is not perfectly just in the kindness of beril perhaps i might trust but the motive you urge for this union my dear is what i confess would awaken my fear as you say your mild sister should never be harrassd by those various ills with which life is embarrassd i should guard her from all the vexations that wait on a liberal mind with a narrow estate and if beril had thoughts of becoming my son had i not more objections yet this must be one  lady harriot i will remove it my lord for indeed this is all as you think they will be pinched by an income too small you shall add to their fortune and large it will be two thirds of the portion you have destined for me  lord seewell dear harriot i am charmed with thy soul i confess you are a generous girl  to a noble excess  lady harriot to that name dear papa i have no title indeed as i only give up what i never can need in your house all my wants will i know be supplied and if i should leave it as carelesss bride the liberal heir of so large an estate will not grieve that my fortune has sunk in its weight or should my swain frown at the change in my purse he may even take old themis for better for worse for though i confess he has won my regard yet the knot of my love is not twisted so hard but twill slip in a moment if ever i see that he is rather more fond of my purse than of me  lord seewell it is a pity the friendly illusions of youth cannot instantly turn into substance and truth your affectionate fancy my dear is delighted with the dream of beholding two persons united whom you fondly suppose only formed for each other  lady harriot i should like mr beril i own for my brother because i am convinced that no mortal on earth in manners in temper in taste and in worth is formed so exactly to suit such a wife on their lasting attachment i would venture my life  lord seewell your warm heart my good girl your young judgment deceives and what the first wishes the second believes dear harriot to this fancied match there may be many bars which your eyes are unable to see a mistress concealed with a young little fry   lady harriot should an angel declare it the fact i would deny for had beril been loaded with such a connection in his eyes i had never perceived his affection but i will presently solve any doubts of this kind as i am soon to be told the true state of his mind for careless has promised   lord seewell o fie my dear fie your intemperate zeal has now risen too high i am really concerned at your great indiscretion  lady harriot nay but hear me my lord  i have dropped no expression no not one single hint that could truly discover why in such a research i commissioned my lover dont think dear papa i would my sister betray   enter a servant servant mr beril my lord sent this letter  lord seewell stay stay does any one wait for an answer below  servant no my lord the mans gone  lord seewell very well you may go  exit servant lady harriot should this be an offer  twould give me great pleasure but i fear he is too modest to take such a measure  dear papa does he venture on any advances  lord seewell there my dear  you will not find any mention of frances and i think by the note which to you i resign your conjectures are not so well founded as mine  lady harriot  perusing the letter occasion for money  the statue to you  i am amazed  and can hardly believe it is true he never would part with so dear a possession but for some urgent reason  lord seewell you see his confession his strong call for money is frankly declared and i fear his small fortune is greatly impaired  lady harriot these tidings indeed give me real concern but the source of this step i will speedily learn careless soon will be here  i will make him discover and till we know all give no peace to my lover  but now my dear lord by this note you may find how the heart of my sister is really inclined i am convinced this will prove her affection is strong here she comes for the trial  pray see if i am wrong  lord seewell well my dear i will try by an innocent plot if your sister has really this passion or not  enter lady frances lord seewell dear fanny youre come our concern to partake for we both are much grieved for our friend berils sake  lady frances mr beril dear sir  is he hurt  is he killed  lord seewell no  with terrors too lively your bosom is filled my dear how you tremble  but i was to blame to raise this alarm in your delicate frame he is well but some crosses of fortune i fear make him fell what he justly considered so dear you will see by this letter   aside to lady harriot ah harriot it is so the excess of her fear from affection must flow  lady frances how painful to him must the exigence be which extorts from his hand the agreement i see how cruel for him to relinquish a treasure whence his elegant spirit derived so much pleasure but i trust dear papa that your generous mind will not now press the bargain he once has declined and scorning to profit by any distress will not catch at the gem he still ought to possess  lord seewell my dear can i now what i offered withhold and should i the statue no less would be sold  lady frances perhaps if you chose half its value to lend from so galling a sale you might rescue your friend  lord seewell i am pleased my dear girl with your spirit i own but these are bad times for a dangerous loan and to tell you the truth in this knotty affair i have just at this crisis no money to spare but i will frankly explain our finances to you and you shall instruct me in what i shall do  as i have seen that old fathers though reckoned most sage often injure a child by the frolicks of age that you may not suffer from follies like these i have just now consigned to the care of trustees all i have saved for you both  so if i prove unsteady you are safe  when you wed both your fortunes are ready  lady frances let the fortune of harriot be sacred i pray for not very distant is her wedding day but as i am convinced i shall not wed at all let my portion papa answer every call i must beg you to look on it still as your own and if it may serve for so timely a loan it cannot give me more joy whatsoever my station than by saving your friend from such mortification  lord seewell my dear girls you are both the delight of my life may each warmhearted daughter be blessed as a wife  what i said was but meant your kind spirit to try for the wants of our friend i can amply supply of esteem it will please me to give him a proof and preserve the fine statue still under his roof  enter a servant servant mr careless my lord  lady harriot now the whole i shall know  going lord seewell stay   servant he wishes to see lady harriot below  lord seewell being equally anxious this point to discover we will all my dear harriot attend on your lover exeunt  scene the apartments of mrs bijou mr bijou where the deuce is my wife  all her rarities placed her apartments adjusted with exquisite taste some disaster has happened or she would be here where she ought to be waiting to welcome the peer and i fancy i heard her in anger below  enter mrs bijou in great agitation mr bijou what is the matter my love  mrs bijou o my dear such a blow i really had swoond if vexation and wrath had not quickened my spirits to scold at the goth that awkward old joan  an unmannerly minx has knocked off the nipple my dear from a sphinx and now on our chimney it cannot be placed with a wound so indelicate maimed and disgraced but i have happily got these two griffins of gold in the room of the sphinxes our candles to hold  mr bijou my dear the exchange is most lucky and right for a sphinx is an awkward dispenser of light but whether your griffins of gold or of copper a flame from his mouth is exceedingly proper  mrs bijou by your lessons my love i improve in virtu all the gusto i have i have gathered from you  i have fixed the great mummy my dear to the wall lest the pert lady harriot should give him a fall she would be glad to throw down my old king out of spite and i would not be vexed in our triumph tonight i know our new picture will stir up her gall and this titian will make us the envy of all my dear dont you think it looks well by this light  mr bijou the colors indeed are uncommonly bright  mrs bijou what a beautiful youth is this joseph  i swear i am more and more charmed with his delicate air i delight in him more since i have found dear bijou that in one of his features he is very like you  mr bijou where can you my dear any likeness suppose  mrs bijou i protest he has got the true turn of your nose not the aquiline curve but a little socratic and his eye flashes fire that is chastely ecstatic  there is a rap at our door and i hope my lords come if vexation and envy do not strike him dumb i think he will harangue like a critic of greece on the exquisite charms of this beautiful piece i long to behold how he is touched by the sight but i know that his envy will sink his delight the moment he sees it he will think his luck cruel in missing so precious a cabinet jewel  enter mr beril and mr cycle mr bijou dear cycle i take this exceedingly kind and i hope you have not left your cremona behind in your presence tonight i most truly rejoice and shall call for the aid of your hand and your voice as my wife gives a snug little concert below when you have seen what her upper apartments can show  mr cycle you may freely command me my friend as you please  mrs bijou youre a judge mr beril of treasures like these and i am eager to show you a titian that is new since we last had the joy of a visit from you  mr beril the story is told maam with striking expression  mrs bijou dont you envy my husband this brilliant possession i thought you would burst forth into rapturous praise but with no keen delight on this picture you gaze  mr beril to confess maam the truth i am a whimsical being and a subject like this i have no pleasure in seeing on your lovely sex it is a satire most bitter that ill nature may laugh at and levity titter but i am grieved when an artist has lavished his care on a story that seems a disgrace to the fair  mrs bijou our sexs chief luster i own it obscures but think what a lesson it offers to yours  enter lady harriot lady frances lord seewell and mr careless mr bijou my dear lord i this instant was wishing for you your voice is decisive in points of virtu and youre come in the moment to end an odd strife in a matter of taste about potiphars wife  should her story be painted  we want your decision and here is the picture that caused our division  lord seewell ha my poor old acquaintance  but how dear bijou how the deuce could this picture find favor with you i hope that rogue varnish has played you no trick  you have paid no great price   mrs bijou i am cut to the quick sure my lord you never looked on this picture before  lord seewell dear madam it is one that i turned out of door and as i may aid you to scape from a fraud i will proceed to inform you i bought it abroad to relieve the distress of an indigent youth who copied old masters with spirit and truth and when it came home as i valued it not my steward by chance this gay furniture got to a new house of his it has lately been carried and as your friend varnish his daughter has married i suppose the sly rogue by this picture has tried to increase the small fortune he gained with his bride search the garment of joseph you will find on its hem and within a dark fold the two letters t m  mrs bijou aye there is the mark  we are cheated we are plundered that infamous villain to ask me eight hundred  but the law shall restore it  mr bijou see mrs bijou see the fruits of my hasty indulgence to you  lord seewell cheer up my old friend  it is my wish that this night may be witness to nothing but peace and delight i will engage to make varnish your money restore and perhaps this adventure may save you much more all we old connoisseurs if the truth we would own have at times been outwitted with canvas or stone but here is one whose example our tribe now invites to correct our mistakes and improve our delights here is beril though blessed with a treasure most rare that with few works of art will admit of compare gives up the proud joys that on such wealth attend for the nobler delight of assisting a friend  mr beril my lord you amaze me how could you divine  o careless your zeal has betrayed my design  lord seewell you have fixed on the traitor yet are not aware that youre almost involved in a dangerous snare but i will show you this traitors accomplice my friend and tell you what mischief these plotters intend you must know tom and harriot in concert pursue their dark machinations against frances and you they have sworn you have a tender esteem for each other which you both have in modesty labored to smother if their charge can be proved i your freedom restrain and sentence you both to the conjugal chain  mr beril o my lord that i love lady frances is true yet i could not avow it to her or to you but to force my confession such means you employ i almost may call them the torture of joy i am overwhelmed with surprise with delight and with dread lest i falsely have heard the kind things you have said speak my dear lady frances my anguish relieve does this tumult of hope my wild fancy deceive  lady frances i so long have my fathers indulgence confessed that against his decrees i shall never protest  mr beril o how shall i thank thee dear pride of my life  lord seewell by cherishing still in the mind of your wife such generous feelings as you have displayed  from my hand my dear beril receive the kind maid your statue is not more indebted to art than she is to nature for moulding her heart they both shall be yours both the statue and bride and the wants of your friend shall no less be supplied  being free from one modish and wealth  wasting vice from those pests of our order the turf and the dice i enjoy my dear children the fortunate power of securing your bliss by an affluent dower your quiet shall never by your income be hurt which shall equal your wish though below your desert  mr beril of your kindness my lord i so feel the excess that my voice cannot speak what my heart would express  mr bijou i am charmed my dear lord by your choice of a son  lord seewell i know my old friend you will approve what i have done you and i dear bijou wanting proper correction have on vanity lavished the dues of affection we have both squandered cash on too many a whim but in taste let us take a new lesson from him and rate our improvements in real virtu by the generous acts he may teach us to do to remember this truth is the connoisseurs duty a benevolent deed is the essence of beauty  mr bijou i confess i too often have been vanitys fool but shall hope to grow wise my good lord in your school and as mirth should be coupled with wisdom i will go and see if the fiddles are ready below exit  lord seewell tonight my dear madam you must not look grave though varnish has proved such an impudent knave i promise to make him your money refund  mrs bijou with surprise and vexation i almost was stunned but depending my lord on your friendly assistance i am ready to drive all chagrin to a distance and to share in the joy of our dear happy guests  mr beril what i owe to you careless this fair one attests and our sister i hope if i dare use the name from your friendship will judge of your loves ardent flame and shortning your rigorous term of probation now fill your kind heart with complete exultation  lady harriot the warm blaze of our joy i assure you dear brother with the cold damp of prudery i will not smother your friend has for you played so feeling a part i confess i am charmed with his spirit and heart as in law and long courtship he likes not to drudge i will make him at once my comptroller and judge  careless i with transport and pride the dear office embrace  lord seewell and long may you fill it with spirit and grace  my voice my dear careless confirms her election and i give her with joy to your tender direction for sealing dear tom you may fix your own day without dreading from law any irksome delay as your father and i have with friendly advances already adjusted your nuptial finances  mr bijou entering our musicians below are all ready my lord of pleasure you teach us to touch the true chord i have selected a few little pieces tonight that are suited i hope to the present delight  may we all think this day the best day of our life it will prove so i am sure both to me and my wife if a bargain should tempt us we will not be rash but remember the titian and pocket our cash to friendship and want all we can we will give and buy no more baubles as long as we live
