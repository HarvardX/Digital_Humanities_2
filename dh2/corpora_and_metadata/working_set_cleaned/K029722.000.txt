to be a rogue he is honest enough to own it but pray what connection have you with the suttlers you are no victualler here are you   gage not absolutely a victualler but i deal in various articles   o daub indeed   gage yes but no business is done here only by contract   o daub a contractor why what the devil you are not risen to such preferment as that sure i never knew you was able to furnish any contract   gage nothing more easy the circumstance depends upon the quantity not the quality i got on very well lately but at first it brought me in several confounded scrapes   o daub as how   gage why i undertook to serve a regiment with hair powder   o daub hair powder what and you sent them flower i suppose   gage flower no no  i should have saved nothing by that i went to the fountain head  the pit and gave em a plentiful stock of lime   o daub lime brick and mortar lime   gage yes brick and mortar lime   o daub and what the plague was not the cheat found out   gage why at first it answered the purpose very well while the weather was fine it did charmingly but one fieldday they was all caught in a fine soaking shower the smoke ran along the lines ecod their heads were all slackd in an instant and by the time they returned to the camp damme if all their heads were not as smooth as an old half crown   o daub a very cross accident indeed   gage yes i stood a near chanceof being tied up to the halberts but i excused myself by saying they looked only like raw recruits before but now they appeared like old veterans of service   o daub but you lost your contract i suppose   gage yes but i soon got another a shaving contract to a company of grenadiers   o daub faith i never knew you practiced that business   gage never handled a razor in all my life i shave by deputy hired sam sickle down from london  an excellent hand handles a razor like a scythe  he will mow you down a regiment of beards in the beating a revally   o daub upon my conscience a pretty way this of working at secondhand i wish myself could do a little by proxy   gage but come what say you for something to eat and a glass of my friend boulards wine and drink his majestys health   o daub with all my heart my

officers mighty delicate looking gentlemen they were dressed quite different from the others their jackets indeed are pretty much the same but then they wear a sort of petticoat as twere with a large hat and feather and a mortal sight of hair i suppose now they are some of your outlandish troops your foreign hessians or such like    st c aye like enough here comes the sarjeant ecod he can sing

and two huzzas   nancy why nelly dont you know me   nell know you egad i dont know whether i do or not  sure it cannot be  and yet sure it is nancy granger   nancy it is her my dear nelly who kisses you now with the truest sense of gratitude for your former kindness and friendship   nell my dear girl  odso i must take care of my reputation  but what in the name of fancy brings you here and in this dress child   nancy how can you ask me that question nelly you are no stranger to the love william and i have for each other a few days would have united us for ever had not cruel fate separated us the regiment being ordered to march immediately no resource was then left but my flying from my fathers house i procured a dress from one of our neighbors sons and that love which induced me to forsake my sex still supports me under every affliction fortunately on my way i met the sergeant and after some entreaty was inlisted and equipped as you see what think you nell does not my dress become me   nell yes indeed i think you make a smart little soldier   nancy why indeed i am rather under size but i fancy in action i could do more real execution than those who look bigger and talk louder but tell me my dear nelly where is william i long to see him does he ever speak of his poor nancy sure he cannot be faithless   nell why really nancy i have some doubts   nancy heavens is it possible   nell ah my poor little soldier i only did it to try your affection your william is true and worthy of your love   nancy you have made a greater shock on my spirits than even an army of frenchmen could have done   air when wars alarms enticed my willy from me my fond heart with grief did figh each fresh remembrance brought fresh sorrow on me i waked ere yet the morn was nigh no other could delight him ah why did i ere slight him cooly answering his fond tale which drove him far amid the rage of war and left silly me thus to bewail but i no longer thus a maid forsaken nor will i mourn like yonder dove for ere the dawn tomorrow shall awaken i will go seek my absent love the distant hills all over i will fly to seek my lover scorning every threatening fear nor distant shore nor cannons loud roar shall longer keep me from my dear    nell but my dear girl consider do you think you can cheerfully go through the toil and fatigue and not repine after your own happy situation you left behind you   nancy o no i still must love though i should regret the occassion of our difficulties   nell difficulty  why then marry him at the drum head and that will end all your difficulties   air what can our wisest heads provide for the child we dote on dearly but a merry soul and an honest heart in a lad who loves her dearly who with kisses and chat and all all that will sooth him late and early if the truth she tell when she knows him well she will swear she loves him dearly let the prude at the name or sight of man pretend to rail severely but alack a day unseen she will play with the lad who loves her dearly say old men whater they will it is a lover still makes day and night roll cheerly what makes our may all holiday but the lad we dote on dearly    nell well my dear nancy you must endeavor to throw off that dress as soon as possible i will tell you what here are some ladies in the camp who condescend to notice me i will endeavor to introduce you to them and they may be of great service to you in the mean time should you by chance meet with william besure you dont discover yourself  hush here is the sergeant   enter sergeant ser why nelly how is this you have had a long conversation together i began to think you had run away with my new recruit   nell o there is no great danger sergeant he is no soldier for me pray is he perfect in his exercise   ser o as handy a lad as ever was come youngster convince her  nancy goes through the exercise   nell very well indeed but sergeant i must beg of you to befriend him as much as you can for my sake   ser any service in my power you may command but a soldiers life is not the easiest in the world so they ought to befriend each other   trio o the joy when the trumpets sound and the march beats around when the steed tears the ground and shouts to the skies resound on glittering arms the sunbeams playing heighten the soldiers charms the sife and the roll of the distant drum cry hark the enemy come to arms the attacks begun    end of act i act ii scene i a grove near the camp enter nell speaking without william come speak to him another time sure nothing could be more lucky however i must obey their ladyships instructions and keep him in ignorance that they may be present at the discovery poor fellow its almost a pity too when one has it in ones power to make him so happy   enter william will i am sorry nell to make you wait but it was an old friend   nell aye aye some one from suffolk i suppose who has brought you news of your dear nancy   will i wish it had it is unaccountable that i dont hear from her   nell unaccountable not at all i suppose she has changed her mind   will no nelly that is impossible and you would think so had you heard how she plighted her faith to me and vowed notwithstanding her parents were my enemies nothing but death should prevent our union   nell o i beg your pardon if her father and mother indeed are against you you need not doubt her constancy but come dont be melancholy i tell you i want to have you stay somewhere near the inn and perhaps i may bring you some intelligence of her   will how dear nell   nell though indeed i think you are very foolish to plague yourself so for even had nancy loved you well enough to have carried your knapsack you would have been very imprudent to have suffered her   will aye but prudence you know is not a soldiers virtue its our business to hold life itself cheap much more the comforts of it show me a young fellow in our regiment who if he gains the heart of a worthy girl and afraid to marry her for want of a little wealth i would have him drummed out of the regiment for discretion   nell very fine but must not the poor girl share in all your fatigues and mishaps   will there nell i own is the objection but tenderness and affection may soften even these yet if my nancy ever makes the trial though i may not be able to prevent her from undergoing hardships i am sure my affection will make her wonder at their being called so i wish i could once boast that the experiment was made   air my nancy quits the rural train a camps distress to prove all other ills she can sustain but living from her love yet dearest though your soldiers there would not your spirits fail to mark the hardships you must share dear nancy of the dale or should you love each danger share ah how shall i secure your health mid toils which you are born to soothe but not endure a thousand perils i must view a thousand ills assail nor must i tremble even for you dear nancy of the dale    scene ii  an open view near the camp enter o daub o daub well to be sure this same camp is a pretty place with their drums and their fifes and their gigs and their marches and their ladies in their regimentals upon my conscience i believe they would form a troop of sidesaddle cavalry if there was any hopes of an invasion but now i am alone by myself it is time i should be after taking my plan and here i see are some of my directions for it  pulls out a pocket book and pencil i cant think what it is makes my hand shake so unless it is mr blauds wine that is got into my head so so let me study my orders a little for i am not used to this business o p and p s who the devil is to understand that o here is the explanation p s the prompters side and o p opposite the prompter so i am to mark down the view as it is to be taken on one side and the other very well p s and o p let me see somewhere hereabout is certainly the best point to take it from  retires   enter sergeant and the two countrymen  st countryman there you rogues there he is    nd c aye aye that is him sure enough i have seen him skulking about these two days if he bent a spy i will suffer hanging   ser he certainly must be a spy by his drawing figures    nd c do seize on him or the whole camp may be blown up before we are aware   o daub prompters side   ser hush we shall convict him out of his own mouth   o daub o yes the star and garter must certainly be p s   ser p s what the devil does he say    nd c treason you may be sure by your not understanding him   o daub and then o p will have the advantage   ser o p that is the old pretender a damned jacobite spy my life on it    st c and p s is prince charles i suppose   ser no you fool p s is the pretenders son    nd c aye aye like enough   o daub memorandum  the officers tents are in the rear of the line    nd c mark that   o daub n b the generals tents are all houses    st c remember that   o daub then the park of artillery i shall never make any thing of that oh the devil burn the park of artillery   ser there is a villain he will burn the park of artillery will he   o daub well faith this camp is easier taken than i thought it was   ser is it so you rogue but you shall find the difference on it o what a providential discovery   o daub to besure the people will like it much and in the course of the winter it may surprise his majesty   ser o the villain seize him directly  fellow you are a dead man if you stir  we seize you sir as a spy   o daub a spy  phoo phoo get about your business   ser bind him and blinfold him if he resists    nd c aye blindfold him for certain and search him too i dare say his pockets are crowded with powder matches and tinderboxes at every corner   o daub tunder and owns what do you mean    st c hold him fast   o daub why here is some ladies coming who know me here is lady sarah sash and lady plume who were at the fetechampetre and will give me a good character   ser why villain your papers have proved you a spy and sent by the old pretender   o daub o lord o lord i never saw the old gentleman in all my life   ser why you dog didnt you say the camp was easier taken than you thought it was    nd c aye deny that   ser and that you would burn the artillery and surprise his majesty  so come you had better confess before you are hanged   o daub hanged for a spy o to besure myself is got into a pretty scrape   ser bring him away but blindfold him the dog shall see no more   o daub i will tell you what mr soldier or mr sarjeant or what the devils your name upon my conscience and soul i am nothing at all but an irish painter employed by monsieur lanternburg   ser there he has confessed himself a foreigner and employed by marshal leatherbag    nd c oh he will be convicted by his tongue you may swear he is a foreigner by his lingo    st c bring him away i long to see him hanging   o daub tunder and wounds if i am hanged what will become of the theater and the managers and the devil fly away with you all together for a parcel of red blackguards  they hurry him off   scene  part of the camp enter lady gorget lady sash and lady plume l plume o my dear lady sash indeed you are too severe and i am sure if lady gorget had been here she would have been of my opinion   l sash not in the least   lady plume you must know she has been rallying my poor brother sir harry bouquet for not being in the militia and so illnaturedly   l sash so he should indeed but all i said was he looked so french and so finical that i thought he ran a risque of being mistaken for another female chevalier   l plume yet you must confess that our situation is open to a little raillery a few elegancies of accommodation are considerably wanting though ones toilet as sir harry says is not absolutely spread on a drumhead   l sash he vows there is an eternal confusion between stores military and millinery such a description he gives  on one shelf cartriges and and cosmetics pouches and patches here a stand of arms there a file of black pins in one drawer bulletmoulds and essencebottles pistols and tweezer cases with battlepowder mixed with marechelle   l gorget o the malicious creature   l plume but pray lady sash dont renew it for see here comes sir harry to join us   enter sir harry bouquet sir harry now lady sash i beg a truce lady gorget i am rejoiced to see you at this delectable spot where lady plume you may be amused with such a dismal variety   l gorget you see lady plume he perseveres   l sash i assure you sir harry i should have been against you in your raillery   sir harry now as gads my judge i admire the place here is all the pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war mars in a visavis and bellona giving a fetechampetre   l plume but now seriously brother what can make you judge so indifferently of the camp from any body else   sir harry why seriously then i think it the worst planned thing i ever beheld for instance now the tents are all ranged in a strait line now lady gorget can any thing be worse than a strait line and is not there a horrid uniformity in their infinite vista of canvas no curve no break and the avenue of marquees abominable   l sash o to be sure a circus or a crescent would have been vastly better   l gorget what a pity sir harry was not consulted   sir harry as gads my judge i think so for there is great capability in the ground   lady sash a camp cognoscenti possitively sir harry we will have you publish a treatise on military virtue   sir harry very well but how will you excuse this the officers tents are close to the common soldiers what an arrangment is that now if i might have advised there certainly should have been one part for the canaille and the west end of the camp for the noblesse and persons of a certain rank   l gorget very right i dare say you would have thought of proper marquees for hazard and quinze   l plume to be sure with festino tents and opera pavilions   sir harry gad the only plan that could make it supportable for a week well certainly the greatest defect in a general is want of taste   l sash undoubtedly and conduct discipline and want of humanity are no atonements for it   sir harry none in nature   l plume but sir harry it is rather unlucky that the military spirit is so universal for you will hardly find one to side with you   sir harry universal indeed and the ridicule of it is to see how this madness had infected the whole road from maidstone to london the camp jargon is as current all the way as bad silver the very postillions that drive you talk of their cavalry and refuse to charge on a trot up the hill the turnpikes seem converted into redoubts and the dogs demanded the countersign of my servants instead of the tickets then when i got to maidstone i found the very waiters had got a smattering of tactics for enquiring what i could have for dinner a cursed drilled waiter after reviewing his bill of fare with the air of a field marshal proposed an advanced party of soup and bouille to be followed by the main body of ham and chickens flanked by a fricasee with sallads in the intervals and corpse de reserve of sweetmeats and whipped syllabubs to form a hollow square in the center   l plume ha ha ha sir harry i am very sorry you have so strong a dislike to every thing militaty for unless you would contribute to the fortune of our little recruit    sir harry o madam most willingly and very apropos here comes your ladyships protagec and has brought i see the little recruit as you desired   enter nell and nancy nell here nancy make your curtsey or your bow to the ladies who have so kindly promised you protection   nancy simple gratitude is the only return i can make but i am sure the ladies who have hearts to do so good natured a deed will excuse my not being able to answer them as i ought   nell she means an please your ladyships that she will always acknowledge your ladyships goodness to the last hour of her life and as in duty bound will ever pray for your ladyships happiness and prosperity that is what you mean you know  aside to nancy   l plume very well but nancy are you satisfied that your soldier shall continue in his duty   nell o yes your ladyship she is quite satisfied   l plume well child we are all your friends and be assured your william shall be no sufferer by his constancy   nell there nancy say something   l sash but are you sure you will be able to bear the hardships of your situation  retires up with nancy   l plume  to nell you have seen him then   nell o yes your ladyship   l plume go and bring him here  exit nell sir harry we have a little plot which you must assist us in   nancy  coming forward with lady sash o madam most willingly   song the fife and drum sounds merrily a soldier a soldiers the lad for me
