 st officer nothing have i learnt what my own thoughts suggest i fear to tell thee   d officer what have thou heard or seen while others slept    st officer as here i kept my watch some two hours since at depth of midnight when the world around was hushed in awful silence next to death a sudden blast impetuous from the south shook the proud palace to its base and soon a general groan on all sides cohod round me loud shrieks of terror and the languid moans of grief succeeded ever and anon a ghastly face rushed by me full of haste and terror and distraction often i asked what had befallen em but gained no reply save broken words and frantic exclamations   d officer where will destruction stop the eldest hope of every house as far as yet we learn this night expired and egypts proudest boast heir to her empire now lies cold in death air death wherever we turn we meet death has broke through natures bounds death the sighing gales repeat death from every echo sounds  recitative  st

and israels tribes had been dismissed from egypt   st virgin what unknown woes may pharaoh yet incur if yet he grants not the demand of moses  menytis your fears if yet there can be ought to fear are vain for all that israel asks is given now on their march they leave this wasted land and shake the dust of egypt from their feet so willed the king who deaf to comforts voice on the bare earth lies stretched in silent sorrow  air by menytis how vain is grandeurs purple pride and guards and roofs of gold how vain through circling guards can sorrow glide and golden roofs are claimed by pain give me ye powers unknown to dwell remote from pomp and care and strife secure from passions that rebel and sheltered from the storms of life  recitative  st officer but see the king  contending passions shake him   enter pharaoh pharaoh accursed sorcerer  but in vain i curse him i am myself the murderer of my child  why did i fear to take a forfeit life a life twice forfeit  he was once an outcast of a vile slave preserved with erring pity and once a murderer flying unpursud my thoughts are wilder than a whirlwinds rage  yes i will follow him to natures verge and would to bottomless perditions

my spirits all mount upward and i feel as i could tread on air even natures wants almost i could forget and toil and hunger lose their effects upon me as i march air less are youthful charms to love less is danger to the brave less to misers gold must prove less than freedom to the slave chorus this is sacred truths decree truth the friend of human race death is honor to the free life is to the slave disgrace  enter messenger recitative messenger cease the loud triumph of your joyful strains egypts stern tyrant dreadful and resistless as the blue pestilence that rides the wind enraged pursues us with prevailing speed the rapid chariot plows the smoking ground and the proud courser scorns our tardy flight chorus o words of horror dreadful sound a thousand deaths beset us round our hope is vain and vain our prayer it is anguish all it is all despair  enter moses recitative moses so soon ye faithless can ye sear so soon turn not your eye to yonder idle pomp of mortal foes the children of the dust but look before ye where the cloudy pillar that marks your destined way to peace and safety veils the dread power who from himself began and fills eternity before whose eye all nature stands rebuked   st israelite forgive the involuntary fears that rise from dangers such as these so great so sudden behind us drives the foe whose iron hand our suffering tribes have felt and mourned so long before us with inexorable wave the sea far sounding beats the sullen shore  moses let me while thus i lift my hand to heaven teach ye once more to trust eternal truth as he lifts up his rod the sea is supposed to be suddenly divided a symphony expressing the commotion of the waters chorus it parts it parts the liquid walls behold of wave on wave in foaming volumes rolled in terror fixed the sea forgets to flow and leaves unveiled the hoary gulf below in safety pass ye chosen tribes along and let the parted deep resound your song  part iii scene i the red sea the israelites passing on before the egyptians first and second israelite recitative  st israelite still i rejoice with trembling when i gaze on this stupendous precipice above and pass this yet untrodden gulf below my heart dies in me and my fears prevail   d israelite fear not the hand that guides us will protect till we have passed in safety to the shore in times to come when we shall rest in peace beneath the shade of our own vine and fig tree remembrance of our dangers past will raise repose to pleasure pleasure to delight air how blessed is he whose tranquil mind when life declines recalls again the years that time has cast behind and wins delight from toil and pain so when the transient storm is past the sudden gloom and driving shower the sweetest sunshine is the last the lovliest is the evening hour  recitative  st israelite but see our foes pursue us     d israelite far behind discomfited they linger and from hence not even their glittering armor is descried   st israelite their arms we see not for the guiding cloud that led our van now guards us in the rear the way grows sleep ascending from the abyss behold the thousands that pass on before us a moving column rising rank over rank swarm on the ascent and quicken all the way chorus it is done the wondrous journeys over they quit the deep they gain the shore they view with joy the path they trod and hark their shout ascends to god  scene ii the borders of the red sea in the desert the israelites as just landed on the coast recitative  st israelite still stands the deep divided still our foes for now i see their glittering arms advance    d israelite stand back  behold the prophet  give him way    enter moses moses fear not the hosts that now enraged pursue though now ye see them ye shall see no more ye waters who at his command whose voice first called ye forth from nothing left disclosed the worlds foundations now again return and at his bidding in your channel flow air again the voice of god is heard again the rushing waters meet the waters that beheld and scared now pay their homage at his feet  recitative israelite behold where boasting egypt lies overwhelmed over rattling chariots and the shouting host flows the calm wave now silent and at rest  moses thus over the race of man and all his works the stream of time divided for a moment shall close for ever but supreme over all god still remains eternal and unchanged  to him with humble adoration bend and while ye triumph over the sons of egypt let pity still remember they were men  air israelite o god of hosts to thee we raise with humble hearts our songs of praise a weak alas and guilty race our merit claims no partial grace no partial grace thy judgments show the father thou of all below and life and death alike proclaim to man the glorics of thy name  recitative moses but see the deep returns the lifeless corse and spreads the shore with trophies of the dead these were our foes  but enmity and life should cease together  in the silent grave all is unbroken peace the oppressor there from troubling ceases and the weary rest   st israelite far far from us be unrelenting rage revenge and all the furies of the mind if god long suffering shall chastise our foes let us thus warned rejoice with fear before him in just displeasure if our crimes are punished not vainly chastend let us kiss the rod  to these whatever from pity they can take let pity give for man is born to woe air with generous tears the dead deplore they wake to love or war no more no longer now destroy or save the dead alas no more are foes with pious hands their limbs compose and give what all must want a grave  recitative moses to god this sacrifice of love is pleasing for god is love  stupendous are his ways ye cannot fathom them  the depth and height surpass your utmost reach of thought to me by parts disclosed through clouds and dimly seen yet know these wonders are not for this age nor you ye chosen from the nations wrought these are but types the substance is to come  the prince of peace who though from jacob sprung was yet ere abrams day he from worse bondage shall like a shepherd lead his chosen race to yet a better canaan there to quaff the streams of life and taste immortal fruit chorus praise to the lord who reigns supreme above praise to the mystic wonders of his love renew the grateful song of ages past the song through heavens eternal year shall last  the end
