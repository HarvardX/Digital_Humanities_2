part i internal disorders scurvy the scurvy being the principal disease incident to the inhabitants of great britain and the source from whence many of their other disorders flow we thought it necessary to commence this salutary work with an account of the nature of and the remedies against this fatal foe to english constitutions  symptoms the symptoms or signs of this dangerous disease are a frequent laziness and lowness of spirits pains in various parts of the body sometimes livid spots often a sallow complexion a continual itching of the blood difficulty of breathing swelling of the legs bleeding at the nose and spongy gums subject to pains and bleedings but it is to be observed that as constitutions differ the signs or symptoms of the disease vary and people according to their years situations in life and manner of living are attacked by this disease under several appearances but some of the above symptoms always attend it according to the constitution of those afflicted for whose benefit we shall point out the most approved and certain methods of cure hitherto discovered  remedies a milk diet with weak whey greens of all kinds fresh vegetables fruits acids scurvy grass ale fresh beer and cider tar water taken twice a day with camphire one scruple aethiops mineral half an ounce powder of gumguaiacum two drachms honey one ounce mix and make an electuary and take the bigness of a nutmeg every night going to rest the patient may likewise drink the decoction of the woods drinking seawater will be found extremely beneficial as will bathing in the sea  but for the easiest and most efficacious remedy for this dreadful disease we may thank capt cook who in his late voyage round the world by the command of his present majesty in the ship resolution preserved himself and all his men from the scurvy by the use of a very simple medicine though he passed through the temperature the frigid and the torrid zones was absent from england three years and eighteen days and went through such a variety of climates as were sufficient to make the severest attacks on the most robust constitution but as his methods of proceeding will appear with most propriety in his own words we shall present our readers with his letter to sir john pringle bart president of the royal society which letter is dated march        and for which captain cook received a premium medal  sir as many gentlemen have expressed some surprise at the uncommon good state of health which the crew of the resolution under my command experienced during her late voyage i take the liberty to communicate to you the methods that were taken to obtain that end much was owing to the extraordinary attention given by the admiralty in causing such articles to be put on board as either by experience or conjecture were judged to tend most to preserve the health of seamen i shall not trespass upon your time in mentioning all those articles but confine myself to such as were found the most useful  we had on board a large quantity of malt of which was made sweetwort and given not only to those men who had manifest symptoms of the scurvy but to such also as were from circumstances judged to be most liable to that disorder from one to two or three pints in the day to each man or in such proportion as the surgeon thought necessary which sometimes amounted to three quarts in the twentyfour hours this is without doubt one of the best antiscorbutic seamedicines yet found out and if given in time will with proper attention to other things i am persuaded prevent the scurvy from making any great progress for a considerable time but i am not altogether of opinion that it will cure it in an advanced state at sea  sourkrout of which we had also a large provision is not only a wholesome vegetable food but in my judgment highly antiscorbutic and spoils not by keeping a pound of it was served to each man when at sea twice a week or oftener when it was thought necessary  portable soup or broth was another essential article of which we had likewise a liberal supply an ounce of this to each man or such other proportion as was thought necessary was boiled with their peace three days in the week and when we were in places where fresh vegetables could be procured it was boiled with them and with wheat or oatmeal every morning for breakfast and also with dried peace and fresh vegetables for dinner it enabled us to make several nourishing and wholesome messes and was the means of making the people eat a greater quantity of greens than they would have done otherwise  further we were provided with rob of lemons and oranges which the surgeon found useful in several cases  amongst other articles of victualling we were furnished with sugar in the room of oil and with wheat instead of much oatmeal and were certainly gainers by the exchange sugar i imagine is a very good antiscorbutic whereas oil such at least as is usually given to the navy i apprehend has the contrary effect but the introduction of the most salutary articles either as provision or medicines will generally prove unsuccessful unless supported by certain rules of living  on this principle many years experience together with some hints i had from sir hugh palliser the captains campbell wallis and other intelligent officers enabled me to lay down a plan whereby all was to be conducted the crew were at three watches except upon some extraordinary occasions by this means they were not so much exposed to the weather as if they had been at watch and watch and they had generally dry clothes to shift themselves when they happened to get wet care was also taken to expose them as little as possible proper methods were employed to keep their persons hammocks bedding clothes etc constantly clean and dry equal pains were taken to keep the ship clean and dry between decks once or twice a week she was aired with fires and when this could not be done she was smoaked with gunpowder moistened with vinegar or water i had also frequently a fire made in an iron pot at the bottom of the well which greatly purified the air in the lower parts of the ship to this and cleanliness as well in the ship as amongst the people too great attention cannot be paid the least neglect occasions a putrid offensive smell below which nothing but fires will remove and if these be not used in time those smells will be attended with bad consequences proper care was taken of the ships coppers so that they were kept constantly clean the fat which boiled out of the salt beef and pork i never suffered to be given to the people as is customary being of opinion that it promotes the scurvy i never failed to take in water wherever it was to be procured even when we did not seem to want it because i look upon fresh water from the shore to be much more wholesome than that which has been kept for some time on board of this essential article we were never at an allowance but had always abundance for every necessary purpose i am convinced that with plenty of fresh water and a close attention to cleanliness a ships company will seldom be much afflicted with the scurvy though they should not be provided with any of the antiscorbutics beforementioned we came to few places where either the art of man or nature did not afford some sort of refreshment or other either of the animal or vegetable kind it was my first care to procure what could be met with of either by every means in my power and to oblige our people to make use thereof both by my example and authority but the benefits arising from such refreshments soon became so obvious that i had little occasion to employ either the one or the other  these sir were the methods under the care of providence by which the resolution performed a voyage of three years and eighteen days through all the climates from    degrees north to    degrees south with the loss of one man only by disease and who died of a complicated and lingering illness without any mixture of scurvy two others were unfortunately drowned and one killed by a fall so that of the whole number with which i set out from england i lost only four  i have the honor to be sir etc   extract of a letter from captain cook to sir john pringle bart dated plymouth sound july        i entirely agree with you that the dearness of the rob of lemons and oranges will hinder them from being furnished in large quantities but i do not think this so necessary for though they may assist other things i have no great opinion of them alone nor have i an higher opinion of vinegar my people had it very sparingly during the late voyage and toward the latter part none at all and yet we experienced no ill effects from the want of it the custom of washing the inside of the ship with vinegar i seldom observed thinking that fire and smoke answered the purpose much better to the above we shall subjoin the following remarks on captain cooks judicious procedure with some other interesting particulars being a summary of the discovery of the great antiscorbutic virtues of sweetwort by dr macbride etc  captain cook begins his lift of stores with malt of this he says was made sweetwort and given not only to those men who had manifest symptoms of the scurvy but to such also as were judged to be the most liable to it dr macbride who first suggested this preparation was led as he says to the discovery by some experiments that had been laid before the royal society by which it appeared that the air produced by alimentary fermentation was endowed with a power of correcting putrefaction the fact he confirmed by numerous trials and finding this fluid to be fixed air he justly concluded that whatever substance proper for food abounded with it and which could be conveniently carried to sea would make one of the best provisions against the scurvy which he then considered as a putrid disease and as such to be prevented or cured by that powerful kind of antiseptic beer for instance has always been esteemed one of the best antiscorbutics but as that derived all its fixed air from the malt of which it is made he inferred that malt itself was preferable in long voyages as it took up less room than the brewed liquor and would keep longer sound experience has since verified this ingenious theory and the malt has now gained to much credit in the navy that there only wanted so long so healthful and so celebrated a voyage as this to rank it among the most indispensable articles of provision for though captain cook remarks that a proper attention to other things must be joined and that he is not altogether of opinion that the wort will be able to cure the scurvy in an advanced state at sea yet he is persuaded that it is sufficient to prevent that distemper from making any great progress for a considerable time and therefore he does not hesitate to pronounce it one of the best antiscorbutic medicines yet found out  this salutary gas or fixed air is contained more or less in all fermentable liquors and begins to oppose putrefaction as soon as the working or intestine motion commences  in wine it abounds and perhaps no vegetable substance is more replete with it than the fruit of the vine if we join the grateful taste of wine we must rank it first in the list of antiscorbutic liquors cider is likewise good with other vinous productions from fruit as also the various kinds of beer it has been a constant observation that in long cruizes or distant voyages the scurvy is never seen whilst the smallbeer holds out at a full allowance but that when it is all expended the disorder soon appears it were therefore to be wished that this most wholesome beverage could be renewed at sea but our ships afford not sufficient convenience the russians however make a shift to prepare at sea as well as at land a liquor of a middle quality between wort and smallbeer in the following manner they take ground malt and rye meal in a certain proportion which they knead into small loaves and bake in the oven these they occasionally infuse in a proper quantity of warm water which begins so soon to ferment that in the space of twentyfour hours their brewage is completed in the production of a small brisk and acidulous liquor which they call quas palatable to themselves and not disagreeable to the taste of strangers the late dr mounsey member of the royal society who had lived long in russia and had been archiater under two successive sovereigns says that the quas was the common and wholesome drink both of the fleets and armies of that empire and that it was particularly good against the scurvy he added that happening to be at moscow when he perused the observations on the jailfever published here he had been induced to compare what he read in that treatise with what he should see in the several prisons of that large city but to his surprise after visiting them all and finding them full of malefactors for the late empress then suffered none of those who were convicted of capital crimes to be put to death yet he could discover no fever among them nor learn that any acute distemper peculiar to jails had ever been known there he observed that some of those places of confinement had a yard into which the prisoners were allowed to come for the air but that there were others without this advantage yet not sickly so that he could assign no other reason for the healthful condition of those men than the kind of diet they used which was the same with that of the common people of the country who not being able to purchase fleshmeat live mostly on ryebread the most acescent of any bread and drink quas he concluded with saying that upon his return to petersburg he had made the same enquiry there and with the same result  thus far my informer from whose account it would appear that the ryemeal assisted both in quickening the fermentation and adding more fixed air since the malt alone could not so readily produce so acidulous and brisk a liquor and there is little doubt but that whenever the other grains can be brought to a proper degree of fermentation they will more or less in the same way become useful that oats will i am satisfied from what i have been told by one of the intelligent friends of captain cook this gentleman being on a cruize in a large ship in the beginning of the late war and the scurvy breaking out among his crew he bethought himself of a kind of food he had seen used in some parts of the country as the most proper on this occasion some oatmeal is put into a wooden vessel hot water is poured upon it and the infusion continues until the liquor begins to taste sourish that is till a fermentation comes on which in a place moderately warm may be in the space of two days the water is then poured off from the grounds and boiled down to the consistence of a jelly this he ordered to be made and dealt out in messes being first sweetened with sugar and seasoned with some prizewine he had taken which though turned sour yet improved the taste and made this aliment no less palatable than medicinal  gout symptoms the urine of the person afflicted is high colored and has a sandy sediment of a reddish cast the part affected looks red and is swelled the pain is exceedingly acute as if the bone was broken and is succeeded by a slight fever and a chilness or shivering which seizes the great toe ancle heel calf of the leg etc  remedy before the afflicted go to bed at night they should take a tea spoonful of volatile tincture of guaiacum in a glass of water keep themselves warm and drink sack whey exercise is very requisite for those afflicted with this disorder  as the duke of portlands gout powder is remarkably efficacious in the cure of this disorder we shall here transcribe the receipt for making it  take of round birthwort root and gentian root of the tops and leaves of germander ground pine and centaury take of all these well dried powdered and sifted as fine as possible an equal quantity mix them well together and take one dram of this mixed powder every morning fasting in a cup of wine and water broth tea or any other vehicle you like best keep fasting an hour and an half after it continue this medicine for three months without interruption then diminish the dose to three quarters of a dram for three months longer then to half a dram for six months more taking it regularly every morning if possible after the first year it will be sufficient to take half a dram every other day as this medicine operates insensibly it will take perhaps two years before you receive any great benefit so you must not be discouraged though you do not perceive at first any great amendment it works slow but sure it does not confine the patient to any particular diet if he lives soberly and abstains from those meats and liquors that have always been accounted pernicious in the gout as champaign drams high sauces etc  rheumatism symptoms feverish and costive body loss of appetite coldness of the extreme parts heaviness of the joints chilness shivering and racking pains in the limbs  remedies be covered warm when you go to bed and take a dram of powder of gumguaiacum the duke of portlands gout powder is likewise used in this disorder but it is to be observed that in the rheumatism which is only accidental and not habitual a few of the dram doses may do but if habitual or has been of long duration then you may take it as for the gout the remedy requires patience as it operates but slow in both distempers  pleurisy symptoms heat thirst a troublesome cough and a violent pain of the side if the patient is bled the blood has a resemblance of tallow when melted  remedies frequent bleedings a blister on the side and half a pint of the following infusion taken twice a day a quart of boiling penny royal water poured en six ounces of fresh horse dung strain it when cold and sweeten it with a quarter of an ounce of venice treacle  fevers symptoms there are two principal sources of fevers one comprehends the causes which render the blood and other fluids of the body too thick the other includes those which make them too thin let us now examine how one sort may be distinguished from the other  it should be observed that in all fevers of every kind there is a morbid or malignant quality introduced and subsisting in the blood as the productive cause and the proper means for curing them are such methods and medicines as by experience have been found effectual for removing their morbid quality and recovering the sick in the shortest time  in some persons when there is too much blood such bleeding may be advised as will draw off the excess except in pestilential distempers in which bloodletting has proved almost always mortal even in the bodies fullest of blood this evacuation must be moderately used in pleurisies as the extremity of pain and difficulty of breathing shall acquire it  that the common people who generally know when persons have fevers may have a little more knowledge of these acute diseases and how to distinguish one kind of them from the other the person who is to direct for the sick should carefully enquire into the state of his body he should examine his pulse let him feel the pulse of two or three that are in health and his own pulse and then compare them with the pulse of the patient and thereby he will come nearly to know how much it differs from the healthful standard as to quickness or slowness and as to its strength and weakness and be able to deduce some conclusions which may guide his conduct then let him learn the degree of febrile heat and one way to do this may be by feeling the side of the neck below the ears through which the large blood vessels pass to and from the brain and thus the degree of the heat of the blood may be known and the other symptoms of the patient should be particularly enquired into  if the heat of the body be excessive the pulse quick and strong the flesh very dry the pores of the skin very close and the thirst very great it may be concluded that the cause which produced that fever has rendered the blood too thick  if the pulse is too quick and not strong and the heat of the body not great if the tongue is very black or dry and the thirst is great or it the patient voids blood by urine or spitting or at his nose or by stool or if he has flat spots on his skin black or reddish in color or if he has a great looseness with watery or thin stools or if he has profuse sweats with a sensible sinking of his spirits and decrease of strength it may be inserted that the fever is of a putrid kind  remedies the following general rules should be observed to drink as plentifully as possible some diluting liquor whenever thirsty such as barleywater mint and balm and sage tea thin water gruel or beef tea made as follows  take a pound of lean beef out it small pour upon it two quarts of water boil it for the space of five minutes then keep for use  to use such nutritious food as most freely may be taken because it abates the acrimony of the blood repairs the waste of the body and is one of the best cordials small whey made with canary or mountain wine may be frequently used  it may be necessary before we proceed farther to premise that in liquid by four table spoonfuls is meant half a gill or two ounces two spoonfuls one ounce one spoonful half an ounce or four drachms  if seized with any feverish complaint take the following mixture  salt of wormwood two drachms lemon juice or any acid a sufficient quantity to make a neutral medicine sugar about two drachms common water about half a pint and about two ounces of nutmeg water or any spirit mix together and take two spoonfuls every three hours  at night take a little sweat going to rest and the next morning continue the mixture or if inconvenient to make up the above medicine or too poor to get it we recommend salt petre as an efficacious as well as cheap remedy  we shall mention one instance of its utility a poor woman asked advice for her husband a man about forty years of age who had a fever with a violent pain in his side and was lightheaded at times  we advised her to get an ounce of saltpeter and powder it then to divide it into four equal parts and each of them into four others for so many doses each of which will contain about half a dram directing that she should give one of them dissolved in a coffee dish of sage tea sweetened with sugar to his palate every three or four hours and when he had taken this salt she came and said that his fever was gone but that his cough remained we then advised her to give him about twenty drops of balsam capivi with powder sugar night and morning and he happily recovered  but if troubled with a cough add of spermaceti in powder two drachms dissolved with the yolk of an egg to be taken in the same manner  or if that cannot be had the following powder  take spermaceti in powder half an ounce sugar and saltpeter each two drachms mixed together and take as much as will lay on a shilling every three or four hours in any liquid  if bound take the following opening mixture  take two drachms of senna leaves boil in ten ounces of common water to eight ounces strain off and add manna half an ounce tincture of senna one ounce mix and take two table spoonfuls every three hours till it operates  this medicine is easily prepared and very handy on many occasions especially when the body calls for a remedy of this nature it is cooling as well as laxative washes its passage through the bowels without any griping or disorder and stands in need at the same time of no over strict regimen  thus far fevers in general proceed we therefore to those more particular  of an acute inflammatory fever the young robust plethoric habit will ever be most liable to inflammations whilst on the contrary in the weakly and infirm the circulation cannot readily be worked up to such a pitch as is requisite to constitute a disease of an inflammatory kind in both cold or obstructed perspiration is almost the only occasional cause this fever may be easily known from the constitution of the sick person a quick full and tense pulse hard beyond its natural state florid countenance with great heat and thirst acute pains in the head back and loins etc  to the cure of an inflammatory fever therefore it is necessary first to take away about six or eight ounces of blood then give about fifteen grains of ipecacuanha in a cup of any liquid and work it off with camomile flower tea having nothing after it that night but a little mulled wine to settle the stomach  tartar emetic two grains diaphoretic antimony ten grains barley water eight ounces mix and take two spoonfuls every four hours and every now and then about as much saltpeter as will lay on a shilling dissolved in the drink  if all this should not open the body it will be necessary to add an emollient clyster  if at the end of the disease the pulse should flag discontinue the medicines and use cordials  if an intermission should happen with gentle sweats and turbid urine the bark in small doses or rather a decoction of it may be thrown in  of a nervous fever this low nervous fever is directly opposite to the acute inflammatory and therefore must be differently treated  it mostly happens from profuse evacuations and to those of relaxed solids and dissolved watery fluids the pulse though quick is here weak and low the heat of body but little beyond the natural and the symptoms in general of the spasmodic kind and independent of inflammation  in the one it becomes necessary to lower the impetus of the circulation by evacuations and coolers in the other the warm cordial the stimulating medicines are by all means advisable to excite the vis vitae and promote such a degree of fever as may suffice for its expulsion  evacuations of blood and by stool can then be of no service in the cure of a low fever but a great detriment a gentle vomit in the beginning and a breathing sweat throughout its continuance will be useful  a warm light nourishing diet and plenty of generous wine will be expedient with blisters and sinapisms or mustard plasters and other drawers of the feet for the relief of the symptoms  first then give the ipecacuanha vomit with the mulled wine as before described and going to bed half a dram of mithridate the next day the following mixture  take venice treatle two drachms syrup of saffron half an ounce simple mint water eight ounces strong cinnamon water two ounces volatile tincture of valerian two drachms mix and take two spoonfuls every three or four hours  to these may be added as occasion requires a little opiate camphire contrayerva valerian cochineal warm aromatics and some volatile salts and when better the gum pills but if toward the latter end of the disease when gentle sweats break out and the urine becomes turbid or thick the bark will be attended with great advantage though there should appear no intermission  intermitting fever or ague symptoms according to the air constitution and strength of the patient intermittents frequently vary some will have a tendency to the inflammatory or degenerate into an acute continual fever especially if too hot a regimen has been used which if it should have been the case gentle cooling purges will reduce it and then give the bark with nitre joined with it on the contrary intermittents will urge on the nervous fever in which case join the cordial aromatics such as snake root contrayerva myrrh camphire and the like with the bark  remedies to cure an intermission the following is advisable  best bark one ounce finely bruised snake root two drachms finely bruised boil in common water from a pint and a half to one pint strain it off and take four spoonfuls every three or four hours if it should purge add to each dose five or six drops of liquid laudanum if it should bind about five or six grains of powdered rhubarb if want of appetite about five or six drops of elixir of vitriol  a variety of different medicines have been found to succeed but the preference has ever been given to the bark twelve drachms of which generally puts by the fit though it is necessary to continue a few doses more to prevent a return  one or two grains of roman vitriol given during the intermission two three or four times in the twentyfour hours or about a dram of alum with thirty grains of nutmeg or snakeroot in half a pint of warm ale or barley water has succeeded well  intermitting fevers those especially whose fits return every other day have been often cured with a few doses of cochineal by taking about half a dram of it in powder some time before the accession of each fit and others have been recovered by taking five six or seven grains of the virginian snake root three times on the days of intermission at about four or five hours distance and i have with success advised some of the poor to drink a quarter of a pint of tea made with the root of burdock every third or fourth hour during the intermissions sweetened with sugar or not sweetened as the patient chooses  these sort of intermittents allow a good opportunity for taking the peruvian bark and that the poor those great objects of our compassion and charity may have the benefit of that excellent remedy at the least expense advise the following method viz  to buy an ounce of the best bark in powder then divide it into eight or twelve equal parts and take a dose of it every third hour during the intermissions beginning as soon as they are quite free from a fit in the following manner viz  mix a dose of the bark with a tea cup of hot water with which it will mix easily and when it is cool enough then let the patient drink it and take after it a glass of punch made in the common way and take his meals at his usual times suppose the time for taking the bark happens at the time of dining let him first take the bark and then eat his dinner i have done so myself  we advise the patient to take the bark in the night as well as in the day which i have done myself several times having a person to sit up and wake me when the time for taking the bark comes  if the patient can take a dram of the bark for a dose without finding his stomach loaded let that quantity be the dose and when he has taken one ounce though he misses the fit yet let the bark be prepared and the doses taken at four hours distance  hectic fevers attended with coughs or consumptions symptoms hectic fevers with coughs are commonly called consumptions on account of the great waste or decrease of the bodies afflicted with them  the symptoms which are obvious and necessary consequences of an ulcerated state of the lungs are a cough a copious spitting of a purulentlike matter which is thrown up night and morning and if tried sinks in water  oppression of the breast bad appetite thirst great hectic fever colliquative sweats which succeed night and morning alternately a lowness and great discharge of urine the pulse becomes quick and sharp the body pines and is emaciated and its several functions totally impaired and decayed  remedies the air where the patient lies ought to be free and pure the constitution must be kept in action and take as much exercise every day as it can bear  horseriding giving the body motion with little fatigue if convenient is preferable to any carriage which should be before dinner else it proves hurtful great care must be taken to prevent catching cold by damp things or otherwise  a southern voyage by sea frequently cures when all things else fail provided the provisions are fresh and as milk cannot there be easily obtained fruits broths and balsamics must supply the place  a proper regimen with the patients own endeavors act mostly toward the cure a mind kept easy with varying objects to divert the attention yet it may be necessary to subjoin some serviceable medicines  first i would recommend for diet light but restorative and diluting drink milk asses milk if obtainable water gruel made of meal or fine white flour with a little butter or sugar or cider whey or barley water or ground ivy tea sweetened with sugar or honey acidulated with the juice of lemon or an apple boiled in a pint of water with one large spoonful of brandy and sweetened as before directed as necessary to promote the spitting up the phlegm  secondly to remove the fever give the following medicine  saltpeter two drachms cochineal half a dram pure water half a pint syrup of balsam or sugar or honey sufficient to palate brandy or rather rum two ounces mix these and take two spoonfuls every third or fourth hour  if there should be a flux then the following  tincture of roses one pint liquid laudanum twenty grains drink a cupful often  if restless at night take storax pill four grains when there is great difficulty of breathing the amnoniac medicine with the oxymel of squills give the most relief  ulcerated lungs the symptoms are described in the last article  remedies compound powder of gumtragacanth one scruple saltpeter ten grains make a powder to be taken in any soft liquid four times a day  if the chest or stomach should be sore emultions of spermaceti or oil of almonds will be useful as well as twenty drops of the balsam capivi night and morning and continued for some weeks even after well and to strengthen all the muscular fibers and vessels of the body close with the preparation of the bark and elixir of vitriol  pestilential disorders symptoms these disorders which go under the different names of morbid malignant putrid pestilential petechial hospital and goal fevers differ only in a degree from each other they arise from many causes such as foul air or putrid animal and vegetable effluvia or from confined places not properly ventilated or kept clean or frequently communicated by contagion  the symptoms in general are lassitude and weakness or loss of strength an oppression or pain in the stomach pulse low or weak bitter taste in the mouth drowth foetid breath a dejected mind frequently sighing wanting to vomit great pain in the head back and loins tongue black chaped though at first white and small spots about the skin resembling the measles but of a purple or livid color eyes heavy yellowish and inflamed and frequently profuse sweating  remedies bleeding here is to be avoided as most dangerous and the first thing clear the stomach by ipecacuanha wine about one ounce worked off with camomile flower tea and mulled wine at night  then begin and take the recipe prescribed for intermitting fevers and drink weak mountain whey with tincture of roses plentifully acidulated with the elixir of vitriol likewise the following bolus three times a day in some tormentile root tea and sweetened with the finest sugar  powder of valerian ten grains powder of snake root ten grains cochineal four grains gum camphire five grains syrup of saffron a sufficient quantity to bind it  if bound the bowels should be gently opened by powdered rhubarb in small doles and if occasion emolient clysters if a diarrhoe or purging cordial restringents and gentle opiates occasionally omit all volatiles as prejudicial  if any morbid quality of the blood discovers itself by any symptom on the skin it is an argument against every evacuating remedy which makes a revulsion from the surface of the body therefore never use them for the cure of any cutaneous disease  st anthonys fire symptoms chillness and shivering great thirst restlessness the face suddenly swelled becomes painful and appears red and pimply and the eyes are closed with the swelling  remedies the patient must lose eight or ten ounces of blood which must be repeated if the symptoms continue strong apply to the part a pultice of white bread and milk and a little hogs lard in it let the pultice be changed twice in a day but flannels wrung out of a strong decoction of elder flowers applied warm afford the speediest ease and relief and every other morning take the following purge till the disorder is cured viz  glaubers salt one ounce manna half an ounce mix and dissolve it in warm water for one dose  the diet in this disease must be very low chiefly water gruel or at most weak broth all strong liquors and flesh meat must be avoided as poison  apoplexy symptoms short breathings imaginary noises in the ears drowsiness loss of memory tremblings staggerings a giddiness in the head and dimness of sight  the disease at its height is a total deprivation of all sense and motion respiration excepted and even that is performed with great difficulty it greatly injures the faculty both of the mind and body and is seldom perfectly curable

an inactive life and live high are most subject to this disease though it is sometimes hereditary and then it attacks more early in life than when it is accidental they may be occasioned by an excess of bloody by strong aloetic purges high seasoned foods by drinking great quantities of wines the neglect of any customary evacuations much riding great costiveness or any thing that occasions hard or difficult stools pregnant women are sometimes afflicted with them  remedies if only little swellings within and without the fundament touch them with a little oil of amber or take lime water four ounces liquid laudanum half an ounce mix together and make a linament so bathe the parts with it very often  if they are bleeding piles care must be taken not to stop them too soon especially if they are periodical and return frequently as they prove salutary but if they continue in such quantity as to waste the patients strength hurt his digestion or impair any functions then a proper regimen and astringent medicines must check the discharge  a linen cloth dipped in camphorated spirits of wine may be applied to the parts and a bread and milk poultice if excessively painful or a little cooling ointment of elder equal parts of each mixed together a dose of manna and salts or sena tea or some cooling physic given in the morning and an electuary made of one ounce of lenitive electuary flower of brimstone half an ounce of cream of tartar two drachms syrup of roses a sufficient quantity to mix together then take the bigness of a nutmeg twice a day occasionally leeches applied to the part or

if tired with running carries his tail bent inwards runs without distinction against all he meets with great fury and bites hurrying on in an hasty and uncertain course dogs that are well are afraid and fly both at the sight and barking of one that is mad the first mad symptom in a dog is an unusual trembling  with respect to the symptoms in persons bit they are principally confused and mischievous looks and an utter abhorrence of water  remedies mix one pound of common salt in a quart of water and then squeeze bathe and wash the wound with the same for an hour and not drink any of it then bind a little salt to the part affected for twelve hours but be very careful to apply it instantly after the bite of the animal  take the leaves of rue picked from the stalks and braised six

a few days after the biting of the dog apply some of the ingredients from which the liquor was strained to the bitten place  bathing in the sea where the patient can be accommodated with conveniences is likewise deemed an admirable remedy  to this we may add that o cure the bite of a viper or adder if you will rub the part bitten with some of the fat of the animal it will prevent any bad effects from arising but if the fat of the animal cannot be procured warm sallad oil will be attended with the same good consequences  cancer symptoms this dreadful disorder originates from a small tumor which often remains for years without increasing and does not change the color of the skin however when the humor becomes more active the swelling suddenly grows large livid round unequal painful then breaks and sharp stinking sores succeed which eat away the sound parts when the lips of the wound become exceeding disgustful to the sight this disorder generally affecs the breasts but sometimes

ounce of spermaceti melt them together over a gentle fire and afterward keep them stirring till the whole is cold  chilblains symptoms chilblains are swellings on the hands and feet from excessive cold accompanied with intolerable pains prickings itchings heat and redness  remedies on their first appearance bathe them with snow water if that can be procured or hold them over the steam of boiling vinegar  if they grow sore and break use the fomentation mentioned in the article of green wounds and then apply a dressing of yellow basilicon mixed with a few drops of spirits of turpentine

half an ounce hogs lard a quarter of a pound mixed together the smell if disagreeable may be taken off by adding a few drops of essence of lemons if necessary rub the whole body let it be done at different times the linen should not be changed and should afterward be well dried and fumigated with brimstone to prevent a fresh infection when cured and three or four brisk purges at different times taken it will not be amiss to drink a glass of cream of tartar whey every morning for a week or more using wholesome food and observing cleanliuess  soreeyes symptoms the symptoms of sore eyes are easily known being redness a stiff gumminess a salt rheum or water flowing from them weakness of sight dimness a painful heat in the eyelids and many others unnecessary to relate as those who feel them must be well acquainted with their nature proceed we therefore to the  remedies we shall here present our reader with the great sir hans sloans celebrated remedies  take of prepared tutty one ounce of lapis haematitis prepared two scruples of the best aloes prepared twelve grains of prepared pearl four grains put them into a prophyry or marble mortar and rub them with a pestle of the same stone very carefully with a sufficient quantity of vipers grease or fat to make a liniment to be used daily morning or evening or both according to the convenience of the patient  the doctor prescribes bleeding and blistering in the neck and behind the ears in order to draw off the humors from the eyes and afterward according to the degree of inflammation or acrimony of the juices to make a drain by issues between the shoulders or perpetual blister and for washing the eyes recommends cold spring water and the best inward medicines which he has experienced to be conserve of rosemary flowers antiepileptic powders such as purvis ad guttetam betony sage rosemary eyebright wild valerian root castor etc washed down with a tea made of the same ingredients as also drops of spirit lavandulae composit and sal vol oleos  if the inflammation returns the dotor says drawing about six ounces of blood from the temples by leeches or cupping on the shoulders is very proper  the liniment

black basilicon inwardly  take a dram of the best peruvian bark in fine powder every four hours in a gill of mountain wine  old ulcers symptoms ulcers are wounds or sores of long continuance and their symptoms virulent matter issuing from them  when any ulcer is of long standing it is dangerous to dry it up without substituting in the place of a discharge which is become almost natural some others such as purging from time to time or cutting an issue near the diseased part  to forward the cure salt meat spices and strong liquors must be most avoided the usual quantity of flesh meat should be lessened and the body be kept moderately open by a vegetable or milk diet and if the ulcers are in the legs it is of great importance to keep in a lying posture for negligence in this material point changes the slightest wounds into ulcers and the most trifling ulcers into obstinate and incurable ones to cure which  take a quarter of a pound of basilicon and an ounce and an half of oil of olives and mix therewith half an ounce of verdigrease dress the sore with this ointment spread open a little tow after fomenting it well with a decoction made of camomile flowers and mallow leaves take

and take half a quarter of a pint frequently in this disorder frequent bleeding in small quantities is proper not exceeding four or at the most six ounces at each time according to the strength of the sick person  a lip salve this may be made by adding a quarter of an ounce of alkanet root to the spermaceti ointment mentioned among the remedies for a cancer and letting them simmer together a few minutes over a gentle fire  biles apply a plaster of diachylon with the gums once every day till they are cured to prevent their return a few doses of cooling physic are proper  burns and scalds take may butter unsalted and white wax of each six ounces oil of olives half a pint lapis calaminaris one ounce and an half melt the wax and butter with the oil and stir in the lapis calaminaris finely powdered till it is too hard to let it settle this is an excellent ointment for the above purposes and is to be applied once a day spread on a fine linen rag  bruises external bathe the part with a little spirits of wine and camphire which in slight cases will effect a cure but if that fails it will be necessary to apply a poultice of stale beer grounds and oatmeal with a little hogs lard which must be applied fresh every day till the bruise is entirely cured  bruises internal take a large spoonful of cold drawn linseed oil two or three times in a day the patient must also be blooded to the quantity of eight or ten ounces and if the symptoms are violent the bleeding must be repeated at discretion  cholic take two ounces of daffys elixir and repeat it as occasion may require or half a dram of powder of rhubarb toasted a little before the fire  colds colds may be cured by lying much in bed by drinking plentifully of warm sackwhey with a few drops of spirits of hartshorn in it or any

compound powder of contrayerva taken night and morning or half an ounce of mindereruss spirit may be given every night going to rest drinking a plentiful draught of weak sackwhey after it  this is a much more easy natural and certain method than the common practice by balsamics linctuss and the like which spoil the stomach destroy the appetite and hurt the constitution  aches and pains rub a little opodeldock upon the part affected two or three times a day and wear a flannel upon it if this does not give relief take twenty drops of volatile tincture of guaiacum every night and morning in

the same  the methods pursued by the humane society for the recovery of persons apparently dead by drowning the society established in london for the recovery of persons apparently drowned induced by a principle of humanity have undertaken to make public the following methods of treating such cases which are now practiced in several countries of europe with amazing success and which they earnestly recommend to the attention of every man but particularly to those who live in seaport towns or places adjacent to rivers brooks ponds etc  method of treatment i in removing the body to a convenient place great care must be taken that it be not bruised nor shaken violently nor roughly handled nor carried over any ones shoulders with the head hanging downwards nor rolled upon the ground or over a barrel nor lifted up by the heels except with the greatest caution for experience proves that all these methods are injurious and often destroy the small remains of life the unfortunate object should be cautiously conveyed by two or more persons or in a carriage upon straw lying as on a bed with the head a little raised and kept in as natural and easy a position as possible  ii the body being well dried with a cloth should be placed in a moderate degree of heat but not too near a large fire the windows or door of the room should be left open and no more persons be admitted into it than those who are absolutely necessary as the life of the patient greatly depends upon their having the benefit of a pure air the warmth most promising of success is that of a bed or blanket properly warmed bottles of hot water should be laid at the bottoms of the feet in the joints of the knees and under the armpits and a warmingpan moderately heated or hot bricks wrapped in cloths should be rubbed over the body and particularly along the back the natural and kindly warmth of a healthy person lying by the side of the body has been found in many cases very efficacious the shirt or clothes of an attendant or the skin of a sheep fresh killed may also be used with advantage should these accidents happen in the neighborhood of a warm bath brew house baker glasshouse saltern soapboiler or any fabric where warm lees ashes embers grains sand water etc are easily procured it would be of the utmost service to place the body in any of these moderated to a degree of heat but very little exceeding that of a healthy person  iii the subject being placed in one or other of these advantageous circumstances as speedily as possible various stimulating methods should next be employed the most efficacious are to blow with force into the lungs by applying the mouth to that part of the patient closing his nostrils with one hand and gently expelling the air again by pressing the chest with the other imitating the strong breathing of a healthy person the medium of a handkerchief or cloth may be used to render the operation less indelicate whilst one assistant is constantly employed in this operation another should throw the smoke of tobacco up by the fundament into the bowels by means of a pipe or fumigator such as are used in administering clysters a pair of bellows may be used until the others can be procured a third attendant should in the mean time rub the belly chest back and arms with a coarse cloth or flannel dipped in brandy rum gin or with dry salt so as not to rub off the skin spirits of hartshorn volatile salts or any other stimulating substance must also be applied to the nostrils and rubbed upon the temples very frequently the body must at intervals be shaken also and varied in its position  iv if there be any signs of returning life such as sighing gasping twitching or any convulsive motions beating of the heart the return of the natural color and warmth opening a vein in the arm or neck may prove beneficial but the quantity of blood taken away should not be large nor should any artery ever be opened as profuse bleeding has appeared prejudicial and even destructive to the small remains of life the throat should be tickled with a feather in order to excite a propensity to vomit and the nostrils also with a feather snuff or any other stimulant so as to provoke sneezings a teaspoonful of warm water may be administered now and then in order to learn whether the power of swallowing be returned and if it be a tablespoonful of warm wine or brandy and water may be given with advantage but not before as the liquor might get into the lungs before the power of swallowing returns the other methods should be continued with vigor until the patient be gradually restored  we have been as circumstantial as possible in the above directions that if one convenience should be wanting the attendants may not be at a loss for others where the patient has lain but a short time senseless blowing into the lungs or bowels has been in some cases found sufficient yet a speedy recovery is not to be expected in general on the contrary the above methods are to be continued with spirit for two hours or upwards although there should not be the least symptoms of returning life the vulgar notion that a person will recover in a few minutes or not at all and the ignorant foolish ridiculing of those who are willing to persevere as if they were attempting impossibilities has most certainly caused the death of many who might otherwise have been saved  most of the above rules are happily of such a nature that they may be begun immediately and that by persons who are not acquainted with the medical art yet it is always advisable to seek the assistance of some regular practitioner as soon as possible not only as bleeding is proper and frequently necessary but as it is to be presumed that such a one will be more skilful and expert and better able to vary the methods of procedure as circumstances may require  n b it is proper to observe that these means of restoration are applicable to various other cases of apparent deaths such as hanging suffocation by damp and noxious vapors whether proceeding from coalmines the confined air of wells cisterns caves or the must of fermenting liquors to those seized with apoplectic and convulsive fits and also to the frozen  wherever any good has been produced by the means recommended the person who has superintended the cure is desired to write a circumstantial account of it to james horsfall esquire treasurer middle temple or mr m robinson gardencourt middle temple secretary to the society  an universal preservative against the plague or any other infection every person who sees others languishing under any sickness or distemper if he has a mind to preserve himself from the infection ought always to discharge his saliva or spittle and never swallow it whilst he remains in the sphere of infected vapors for the saliva is the first thing that very readily attracts the infected vapors which being swallowed with it are carried as it were by this vehicle into the stomach where they occasion most fatal effects  the greater part of distempers and particularly malignant fevers are contagious this contagion arising from the ferment that proceeds from the sick person diffuses itself as a vapor in the ambient air and infects every thing to a certain distance so that these infected vapors being drawn into the mouth by respiration are capable of corrupting the saliva which being swallowed infects the stomach and afterward the rest of the body but when one spits the body is secured from infection  for this reason tobacco or spicey substances or of a strong smell kept in the mouth and chewed for exciting the saliva may be of great service to all those who visit infected persons  directions concerning bleeding of all the remedies recurred to in relieving the diseased part of mankind there are none of such general service and advantage as that of bleeding as there is no one on the other hand attended with more pernicious consequences when indirectly and injudiciously ordered a number of illnesses are absolutely owing to too great a quantity of blood in which case there is ever of course an indispensable necessity for proportionably draining this fluid  in all inflammatory distempers it is next kin to a sacrilege to omit it as it is on the contrary exposing the patient to the utmost hazard to injoin it in a low languid depressed state where the spirits before were too much exhausted and nature consequently unable to support the least evacuation  in a word wherever prevail soreeyes a sciatic a dry husky cough an headache inflammations of the womb or bladder a virulent gonorrhoea cordee venereal stricture inflamed piles hot rheumatism dry gripes sore throat an asthma cholic strangury gravel nephretic pains haemorrhages an inveterate itch and the like the opening of a vein is of peculiar service but in dropsies a jaundice the gout and all complaints arising from too great a relaxation of the vessels or obstruction of them remedies adapted to the respective disorders must be sought for from other specific quarters without the least thought of increasing those disorders by abrupt and preposterous bleeding  finis
