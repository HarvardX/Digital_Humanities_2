essays on suicide and the immortality of the soul ascribed to the late david hume esquire  never before published  with remarks intended as an antidote to the poison contained in these performances by the editor  to which is added two letters on suicide from rosseaus eloisa  london printed for m smith and sold by the booksellers in piccadilly fleet street and paternosterrow        price   s   d sewed  preface these two essays on suicide and the immortality of the soul though not published in any edition of his works are generally attributed to the late ingenious mr hume  the wellknown contempt of this eminent philosopher for the common convictions of mankind raised an apprehension of the contents from the very title of these pieces but the celebrity of the authors name renders them notwithstanding in some degree objects of great curiosity  owing to this circumstance a few copies have been clandestinely circulated at a large price for some time but without any comment the very mystery attending this mode of selling them made them more an object of request than they would otherwise have been  the present publication comes abroad under no such restraint and possesses very superior advantages the notes annexed are intended to expose the sophistry contained in the original essays and may show how little we have to fear from the adversaries of these great truths from the pitiful figure which even mr hume makes in thus violently exhausting his last strength in an abortive attempt to traduce or discredit them  the two very masterly letters from the eloisa of rosseau on the subject of suicide have been much celebrated and we hope will be considered as materially increasing the value of this curious collection  the admirers of mr hume will be pleased with seeing the remains of a favorite author rescued in this manner from that oblivion to which the prejudices of his countrymen had in all appearance consigned them and even the religious part of mankind have some reason of triumph from the striking instance here given of truths superiority to error even when error has all the advantage of an elegant genius and a great literary reputation to recommend it  m  essay i on suicide one considerable advantage that arises from philosophy consists in the sovereign antidote which it affords to superstition and false religion all other remedies against that pestilent distemper are vain or at least uncertain plain good sense and the practice of the world which alone serve most purposes of life are here found ineffectual history as well as daily experience furnish instances of men endowed with the strongest capacity for business and affairs who have all their lives crouched under slavery to the grossest superstition even gaiety and sweetness of temper which infuse a balm into every other wound afford no remedy to so virulent a poison as we may particularly observe of the fair sex who though commonly possessed of these rich presents of nature feel many of their joys blasted by this importunate intruder but when sound philosophy has once gained possession of the mind superstition is effectually excluded and one may fairly affirm that her triumph over this enemy is more complete than over most of the vices and imperfections incident to human nature love or anger ambition or avarice have their root in the temper and affections which the soundest reason is scarce ever able fully to correct but superstition being founded on false opinion must immediately vanish when true philosophy has inspired juster sentiments of superior powers the contest is here more equal between the distemper and the medicine and nothing can hinder the latter from proving effectual but its being false and sophisticated  it will here be superfluous to magnify the merits of philosophy by displaying the pernicious tendency of that vice of which it cures the human mind   the superstitious man says tully de divin lib ii is miserable in every scene in every incident in life even sleep itself which banishes all other cares of unhappy mortals affords to him matter of new terror while he examines his dreams and finds in those visions of the night prognostications of future calamities i may add that though death alone can put a full period to his misery he dares not fly to this refuge but still prolongs a miserable existence from a vain fear lest he offend his maker by using the power with which that beneficent being has endowed him the presents of god and nature are ravished from us by this cruel enemy and notwithstanding that one step would remove us from the regions of pain and sorrow her menaces still chain us down to a hated being which she herself chiefly contributes to render miserable  it is observed by such as have been reduced by the calamities of life to the necessity of employing this fatal remedy that if the unseasonable care of their friends deprive them of that species of death which they proposed to themselves they seldom venture upon any other or can summon up so much resolution a second time as to execute their purpose so great is our horror of death that when it presents itself under any form besides that to which a man has endeavored to reconcile his imagination it acquires new terrors and overcomes his feeble courage but when the menaces of superstition are joined to this natural timidity no wonder it quite deprives men of all power over their lives since even many pleasures and enjoyments to which we are carried by a strong propensity are torn from us by this inhuman tyrant let us here endeavor to restore men to their native liberty by examining all the common arguments against suicide and showing that that action may be free from every imputation of guilt or blame according to the sentiments of all the ancient philosophers    if suicide be criminal it must be a transgression of our duty either to god our neighbor or ourselves  to prove that suicide is no transgression of our duty to god the following considerations may perhaps suffice in order to govern the material world the almighty creator has established general and immutable laws by which all bodies from the greatest planet to the smallest particle of matter are maintained in their proper sphere and function to govern the animal world he has endowed all living creatures with bodily and mental powers with senses passions appetites memory and judgment by which they are impelled or regulated in that course of life to which they are destined these two distinct principles of the material and animal world continually encroach upon each other and mutually retard or forward each others operation the powers of men and of all other animals are restrained and directed by the nature and qualities of the surrounding bodies and the modifications and actions of these bodies are incessantly altered by the operation of all animals man is stopped by rivers in his passage over the surface of the earth and rivers when properly directed lend their force to the motion of machines which serve to the use of man but though the provinces of the material and animal powers are not kept entirely separate there results from thence no discord or disorder in the creation on the contrary from the mixture union and contrast of all the various powers of inanimate bodies and living creatures arises that sympathy harmony and proportion which affords the surest argument of supreme wisdom the providence of the deity appears not immediately in any operation but governs every thing by those general and immutable laws which have been established from the beginning of time all events in one sense may be pronounced the action of the almighty they all proceed from those powers with which he has endowed his creatures a house which falls by its own weight is not brought to ruin by his providence more than one destroyed by the hands of men nor are the human faculties less his workmanship than the laws of motion and gravitation when the passions play when the judgment dictates when the limbs obey this is all the operation of god and upon these animate principles as well as upon the inanimate has he established the government of the universe every event is alike important in the eyes of that infinite being who takes in at one glance the most distant regions of space and remotest periods of time there is no event however important to us which he has exempted from the general laws that govern the universe or which he has peculiarly reserved for his own immediate action and operation the revolution of states and empires depends upon the smallest caprice or passion of single men and the lives of men are shortened or extended by the smallest accident of air or diet sunshine or tempest nature still continues her progress and operation and if general laws be ever broke by particular volitions of the deity it is after a manner which entirely escapes human observation as on the one hand the elements and other inanimate parts of the creation carry on their action without regard to the particular interest and situation of men so men are entrusted to their own judgment and discretion in the various shocks of matter and may employ every faculty with which they are endowed in order to provide for their ease happiness or preservation what is the meaning then of that principle that a man who tired of life and hunted by pain and misery bravely overcomes all the natural terrors of death and makes his escape from this cruel scene that such a man i say has incurred the indignation of his creator by encroaching on the office of divine providence and disturbing the order of the universe shall we assert that the almighty has reserved to himself in any peculiar manner the disposal of the lives of men and has not submitted that event in common with others to the general laws by which the universe is governed this is plainly salse the lives of men depend upon the same laws as the lives of all other animals and these are subjected to the general laws of matter and motion the fall of a tower or the infusion of a poison will destroy a man equally with the meanest creature an inundation sweeps away every thing without distinction that comes within the reach of its fury since therefore the lives of men are for ever dependant on the general laws of matter and motion is a mans disposing of his life criminal because in every case it is criminal to encroach upon these laws or disturb their operation but this seems absurd all animals are entrusted to their own prudence and skill for their conduct in the world and have full authority as far as their power extends to alter all the operations of nature without the exercise of this authority they could not subsist a moment every action every motion of a man innovates on the order of some parts of matter and diverts from their ordinary course the general laws of motion putting together therefore these conclusions we find that human life depends upon the general laws of matter and motion and that it is no encroachment on the office of providence to disturb or alter these general laws has not every one of consequence the free disposal of his own life and may he not lawfully employ that power with which nature has endowed him in order to destroy the evidence of this conclusion we must show a reason why this particular case is excepted is it because human life is of such great importance that it is a presumption for human prudence to dispose of it but the life of a man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster and were it of ever so great importance the order of human nature has actually submitted it to human prudence and reduced us to a necessity in every incident of determining concerning it  were the disposal of human life so much reserved as the peculiar province of the almighty that it were an encroachment on his right for men to dispose of their own lives it would be equally criminal to act for the preservation of life as for its destruction if i turn aside a stone which is falling upon my head i disturb the course of nature and i invade the peculiar province of the almighty by lengthening out my life beyond the period which by the general laws of matter and motion he had assigned it    a hair a fly an insect is able to destroy this mighty being whose life is of such importance is it an absurdity to suppose that human prudence may lawfully dispose of what depends on such insignificant causes it would be no crime in me to divert the nile or danube from its course were i able to effect such purposes where then is the crime of turning a few ounces of blood from their natural channel  do you imagine that i repine at providence or curse my creation because i go out of life and put a period to a being which were it to continue would render me miserable far be such sentiments from me i am only convinced of a matter of fact which you yourself acknowledge possible that human life may be unhappy and that my existence if further prolonged would become ineligible but i thank providence both for the good which i have already enjoyed and for the power with which i am endowed of escaping the ill that threatens me agamus dei gratias quad nemo in vita teneri potest sen epist    to you it belongs to repine at providence who foolishly imagine that you have no such power and who must still prolong a hated life though loaded with pain and sickness with shame and poverty  do not you teach that when any ill befalls me though by the malice of my enemies i ought to be resigned to providence and that the actions of men are the operations of the almighty as much as the actions of inanimate beings when i fall upon my own sword therefore i receive my death equally from the hands of the deity as if it had proceeded from a lion a precipice or a fever the submission which you require to providence in every calamity that befalls me excludes not human skill and industry if possible by their means i can avoid or escape the calamity and why may i not employ one remedy as well as another  if my life be not my own it were criminal for me to put it in danger as well as to dispose of it nor could one man deserve the appellation of hero whom glory or friendship transports into the greatest dangers and another merit the reproach of wretch or miscreant who puts a period to his life from the same or like motives  there is no being which possesses any power or faculty that it receives not from its creator nor is there any one which by ever so irregular an action can encroach upon the plan of his providence or disorder the universe its operations are his works equally with that chain of events which it invades and which ever principle prevails we may for that very reason conclude it to be most favored by him be it animate or inanimate rational or irrational it is all a case its power is still derived from the supreme creator and is alike comprehended in the order of his providence when the horror of pain prevails over the love of life when a voluntary action anticipates the effects of blind causes it is only in consequence of those powers and principles which he has implanted in his creatures divine providence is still inviolate and placed far beyond the reach of human injuries it is impious says the old roman superstition tacit ann lib i to divert rivers from their course or invade the prerogatives of nature it is impious says the french superstition to inoculate for the smallpox or usurp the business of providence by voluntarily producing distempers and maladies it is impious says the modern european superstition to put a period to our own life and thereby rebel against our creator and why not impious say i to build houses cultivate the ground or sail upon the ocean in all these actions we employ our powers of mind and body to produce some innovation in the course of nature and in none of them do we any more they are all of them therefore equally innocent or equally criminal but you are placed by providence like a centinal in a particular station and when you desert it without being recalled you are equally guilty of rebellion against your almighty sovereign and have incurred his displeasure  i ask why do you conclude that providence has placed me in this station for my part i find that i owe my birth to a long chain of causes of which many depended upon voluntary actions of men but providence guided all these causes and nothing happens in the universe without its consent and cooperation if so then neither does my death however voluntary happen without its consent and whenever pain or sorrow so far overcome my patience as to make me tired of life i may conclude that i am recalled from my station in the clearest and most express terms it is providence surely that has placed me at this present in this chamber but may i not leave it when i think proper without being liable to the imputation of having deserted my post or station when i shall be dead the principles of which i am composed will still perform their part in the universe and will be equally useful in the grand fabric as when they composed this individual creature the difference to the whole will be no greater than betwixt my being in a chamber and in the open air the one change is of more importance to me than the other but not more so to the universe   it is a kind of blasphemy to imagine that any created being can disturb the order of the world or invade the business of providence it supposes that that being possesses powers and faculties which it received not from its creator and which are not subordinate to his government and authority a man may disturb society no doubt and thereby incur the displeasure of the almighty but the government of the world is placed far beyond his reach and violence and how does it appear that the almighty is displeased with those actions that disturb society by the principles which he has implanted in human nature and which inspire us with a sentiment of remorse if we ourselves have been guilty of such actions and with that of blame and disapprobation if we ever observe them in others  let us now examine according to the method proposed whether suicide be of this kind of actions and be a breach of our duty to our neighbor and to society  a man who retires from life does no harm to society he only ceases to do good which if it is an injury is of the lowest kind  all our obligations to do good to society seem to imply something reciprocal i receive the benefits of society and therefore ought to promote its interests but when i withdraw myself altogether from society can i be bound any longer but allowing that our obligations to do good were perpetual they have certainly some bounds i am not obliged to do a small good to society at the expense of a great harm to myself why then should i prolong a miserable existence because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me if upon account of age and infirmities i may lawfully resign any office and employ my time altogether in fencing against these calamities and alleviating as much as possible the miseries of my future life why may i not cut short these miseries at once by an action which is no more prejudicial to society  but suppose that it is no longer in my power to promote the interest of society suppose that i am a burden to it suppose that my life hinders some person from being much more useful to society in such cases my resignation of life must not only be innocent but laudable and most people who lie under any temptation to abandon existence are in some such situation those who have health or power or authority have commonly better reason to be in humor with the world    a man is engaged in a conspiracy for the public interest is seized upon suspicion is threatened with the rack and knows from his own weakness that the secret will be extorted from him could such a one consult the public interest better than by putting a quick period to a miserable life this was the case of the famous and brave strozi of florence  again suppose a malefactor is justly condemned to a shameful death can any reason be imagined why he may not anticipate his punishment and save himself all the anguish of thinking on its dreadful approaches he invades the business of providence no more than the magistrate did who ordered his execution and his voluntary death is equally advantageous to society by ridding it of a pernicious member  that suicide may often be consistent with interest and with our duty to ourselves no one can question who allows that age sickness or misfortune may render life a burden and make it worse even than annihilation i believe that no man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping for such is our natural horror of death that small motives will never be able to reconcile us to it and though perhaps the situation of a mans health or fortune did not seem to require this remedy we may at least be assured that any one who without apparent reason has had recourse to it was cursed with such an incurable depravity or gloominess of temper as must poison all enjoyment and render him equally miserable as if he had been loaded with the most grievous misfortunes  if suicide be supposed a crime it is only cowardice can impel us to it if it be no crime both prudence and courage should engage us to rid ourselves at once of existence when it becomes a burden it is the only way that we can then be useful to society by setting an example which if imitated would preserve to every one his chance for happiness in life and would effectually free him from all danger of misery it would be easy to prove that suicide is as lawful under the christian dispensation as it was to the heathens there is not a single text of scripture which prohibits it that great and infallible rule of faith and practice which must control all philosophy and human reasoning has left us in this particular to our natural liberty resignation to providence is indeed recommended in scripture but that implies only submission to ills that are unavoidable not to such as may be remedied by prudence or courage thou shall not kill is evidently meant to exclude only the killing of others over whose life we have no authority that this precept like most of the scripture precepts must be modified by reason and common sense is plain from the practice of magistrates who punish criminals capitally notwithstanding the letter of the law but were this commandment ever so express against suicide it would now have no authority for all the law of moses is abolished except so far as it is established by the law of nature and we have already endeavored to prove that suicide is not prohibited by that law in all cases christians and heathens are precisely upon the same footing cato and brutus arrea and portia acted herocially those who now imitate their example ought to receive the same praises from posterity the power of committing suicide is regarded by pliny as an advantage which men possess even above the deity himself deus non sibi potest mortem consciscere si velit quod homini dedit optimum in tantis vitae paenis lib ii cap       essay ii on the immortality of the soul by the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the immortality of the soul the arguments for it are commonly derived either from metaphysical topics or moral or physical but in reality it is the gospel and the gospel alone that has brought life and immortality to light  i metaphysical topics suppose that the soul is immaterial and that it is impossible for thought to belong to a material substance    but just metaphysics teach us that the notion of substance is wholly confused and imperfect and that we have no other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular qualities inhering in an unknown something matter therefore and spirit are at bottom equally unknown and we cannot determine what qualities inhere in the one or in the other   they likewise teach us that nothing can be decided a priori concerning any cause or effect and that experience being the only source of our judgments of this nature we cannot know from any other principle whether matter by its structure or arrangement may not be the cause of thought abstract reasonings cannot decide any question of fact or existence  but admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the universe like the etherial fire of the stoics and to be the only inherent subject of thought we have reason to conclude from analogy that nature uses it after the manner she does the other substance matter she employs it as a kind of paste or clay modifies it into a variety of forms and existences dissolves after a time each modification and from its substance erects a new form as the same material substance may successively compose the bodies of all animals the same spiritual substance may compose their minds their consciousness or that system of thought which they formed during life may be continually dissolved by death and nothing interests them in the new modification the most positive assertors of the mortality of the soul never denied the immortality of its sustance and that an immaterial substance as well as a material may lose its memory or consciousness appears in part from experience if the soul be immaterial  reasoning from the common course of nature and without supposing any new interposition of the supreme cause which ought always to be excluded from philosophy what is incorruptible must also be ingenerable the soul therefore if immortal existed before our birth and if the former existence no ways concerned us neither will the latter  animals undoubtedly feel think love hate will and even reason though in a more imperfect manner than men are their souls also immaterial and immortal    ii let us now consider the moral arguments chiefly those derived from the justice of god which is supposed to be farther interested in the farther punishment of the vicious and reward of the virtuous  but these arguments are grounded on the supposition that god has attributes beyond what he has exerted in this universe with which alone we are acquainted whence do we infer the existence of these attributes  it is very safe for us to affirm that whatever we know the deity to have actually done is best but it is very dangerous to affirm that he must always do what to us seems best in how many instances would this reasoning fail us with regard to the present world  but if any purpose of nature be clear we may affirm that the whole scope and intention of mans creation so far as we can judge by natural reason is limited to the present life with how weak a concern from the original inherent structure of the mind and passions does he ever look farther what comparison either for steadiness or efficacy betwixt so floating an idea and the most doubtful persuasion of any matter of fact that occurs in common life there arise indeed in some minds some unaccountable terrors with regard to futurity but these would quickly vanish were they not artificially sostered by precept and education and those who foster them what is their motive only to gain a livelihood and to acquire power and riches in this world their very zeal and industry therefore is an argugument against them  what cruelty what iniquity what injustice in nature to confine all our concern as well as all our knowledge to the present life if there be another scene still waiting us of infinitely greater consequence ought this barbarous deceit to be ascribed to a beneficent and wise being  observe with what exact proportion the task to be performed and the performing powers are adjusted throughout all nature if the reason of man gives him great superiority above other animals his necessities are proportionably multiplied upon him his whole time his whole capacity activity courage and passion find sufficient employment in fencing against the miseries of his present condition and frequently nay almost always are too slender for the business assigned them  a pair of shoes perhaps was never yet wrought to the highest degree of perfection which that comodity is capable of attaining yet it is necessary at least very useful that there should be some politicians and moralists even some geometers poets and philosophers among mankind the powers of men are no more superior to their wants considered merely in this life than those of foxes and hares are compared to their wants and to their period of existence the inference from parity of reason is therefore obvious   on the theory of the souls mortality the inferiority of womens capacity is easily accounted for their domestic life requires no higher faculties either of mind or body this circumstance vanishes and becomes absolutely insignificant on the religious theory the one sex has an equal task to perform as the other their powers of reason and resolution ought also to have been equal and both of them infinitely greater than at present as every effect implies a cause and that another till we reach the first cause of all which is the deity every thing that happens is ordained by him and nothing can be the object of his punishment or vengeance  by what rule are punishments and rewards distributed what is the divine standard of merit and demerit shall we suppose that human sentiments have place in the deity how bold that hypothesis we have no conception of any other sentiments  according to human sentiments sense courage good manners industry prudence genius etc are essential parts of personal merits shall we therefore erect an elysium for poets and heroes like that of the ancient mythology why confine all rewards to one species of virtue punishment without any proper end or purpose is inconsistent with our ideas of goodness and justice and no end can be served by it after the whole scene is closed punishment according to our conception should bear some proportion to the offense why then eternal punishment for the temporary offenses of so frail a creature as man can any one approve of alexders rage who intended to extirminate a whole nation because they had seized his favorite horse bucephalus quint curtius lib vi cap     heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men the good and the bad but the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue  were one to go round the world with an intention of giving a good supper to the righteous and a sound drubbing to the wicked he would frequently be embarrassed in his choice and would find that the merits and the demerits of most men and women scarcely amount to the value of either  to suppose measures of approbation and blame different from the human confounds every thing whence do we learn that there is such a thing as moral distinctions but from our own sentiments  what man who has not met with personal provacation or what goodnatured man who has could inflict on crimes from the sense of blame alone even the common legal frivolous punishments and does any thing steel the breast of judges and juries against the sentiments of humanity but reflection on necessity and public interest by the roman law those who had been guilty of parricide and confessed their crime were put into a sack alone with an ape a dog and a serpent and thrown into the river death alone was the punishment of those whose who denied their guilt however fully proved a criminal was tried before augustus and condemned after a full conviction but the humane emperor when he put the last interrogatory gave it such a turn as to lead the wretch into a denial of his guilt you surely said the prince did not kill your father suet augus cap   this lenity suits our natural ideas of right even toward the greatest of all criminals and even though it prevents so inconsiderable a sufference nay even the most bigoted priest would naturally without reflection approve of it provided the crime was not heresy or infidelity for as these crimes hurt himself in his temporal interest and advantages perhaps he may not be altogether so indulgent to them the chief scource of moral ideas is the reflection on the interest of human society ought these interests so short so frivolous to be guarded by punishments eternal and infinite the damnation of one man is an infinitely greater evil in the universe than the subversion of a thousand millions of kingdoms nature has rendered human infancy peculiarly frail and mortal as it were on purpose to refute the notion of a probationary state the half of mankind die before they are rational creatures  iii the physical arguments from the analogy of nature are strong for the mortality of the soul and are really the only philosophical arguments which ought to be admitted with regard to this question or indeed any question of fact  where any two objects are so closely connected that all alterations which we have ever seen in the one are attended with proportionable alterations in the other we ought to conclude by all rules of analogy that when there are still greater alterations produced in the former and it is totally dissolved there follows a total dissolution of the latter  sleep a very small effect on the body is attended with a temporary extinction at least a great confusion in the soul  the weakness of the body and that of the mind in infancy are exactly proportioned their vigor in manhood their sympathetic disorder in sickness their common gradual decay in old age the step further seems unavoidable their common dissolution in death the last symptoms which the mind discovers are disorder weakness insensibility and stupidity the forerunners of its annihilation the farther progress of the same causes increasing the same effects totally extinguish it judging by the usual analogy of nature no form can continue when transferred to a condition of life very different from the original one in which it was placed trees perish in the water fishes in the air animals in the earth even so small a difference as that of climate is often fatal what reason then to imagine that an immense alteration such as is made on the soul by the dissolution of its body and all its organs of thought and sensation can be effected without the dissolution of the whole every thing is in common betwixt soul and body the organs of the one are all of them the organs of the other the existence therefore of the one must be dependant on that of the other  the souls of animals are allowed to be mortal and these bear so near a resemblance to the souls of men that the analogy from one to the other forms a very strong argument their bodies are not more resembling yet no one rejects the argument drawn from comparative anatomy the metempsychosis is therefore the only system of this kind that philosophy can hearken to    nothing in this world is perpetual every thing however seemingly firm is in continual flux and change the world itself gives symptoms of frailty and dissolution how contrary to analogy therefore to imagine that one single form seemingly the frailest of any and subject to the greatest disorders is immortal and indissoluble   what daring theory is that how lightly not to say how rashly entertained how to dispose of the infinite number of posthumous existences ought also to embarrass the religious theory every planet in every solar system we are at liberty to imagine peopled with intelligent mortal beings at least we can fix on no other supposition for these then a new universe must every generation be created beyond the bounds of the present universe or one must have been created at first so prodigiously wise as to admit of this continual influx of beings   ought such bold suppositions to be received by any philosophy and that merely on the pretext of a bare possibility when it is asked whether agamemnon thersites hannibal varro and every stupid clown that ever existed in italy seythia bactria or guinea are now alive can any man think that a scrutiny of nature will furnish arguments strong enough to answer so strange a question in the affirmative the want of argument without revelation sufficiently establishes the negative   quanto facilius says pliny lib   cap      certius que sibi quemque credere ac specimen securitatis antigene tali sumere experimento our insensibility before the composition of the body seems to natural reason a proof of a like state after dissolution  were our horrors of annihilation an original passion not the effect of our general love of happiness it would rather prove the mortality of the soul for as nature does nothing in vain she would never give us a horror against an impossible event she may give us a horror against an unavoidable event provided our endeavors as in the present case may often remove it to some distance death is in the end unavoidable yet the human species could not be preserved had not nature inspired us with an aversion toward it all doctrines are to be suspected which are favored by our passions and the hopes and fears which gave rise to this doctrine are very obvious  it is an infinite advantage in every controversy to defend the negative if the question be out of the common experienced course of nature this circumstance is almost if not altogether decisive by what arguments or analogies can we prove any state of existence which no one ever saw and which no way resembles any that ever was seen who will repose such trust in any pretended philosophy as to admit upon its testimony the reality of so mavelous a scene some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose and some new faculties of the mind that may enable us to comprehend that logic  nothing could set in a fuller light the infinite obligations which mankind have to divine revelation since we find that no other medium could ascertain this great and important truth  anti suicide   this elaborate eulogium on philosophy points obliquely at religion which we christians consider as the only sovereign antidote to every disease incident to the mind of man it is indeed hard to say what reason might do were it freed from all restraints especially if a succession of philosophers were incessantly improving on one another as they went on avoiding and correcting the mistakes of those who preceded them in the same pursuit till at last one complete and rational system was effected great things might probably be accomplished in this manner but no such plan in fact ever was or is likely to be finished neither priestcraft nor magisterial powers however cramped the progres of improving reason or baffled the genius of enquiring man the principles of religion and virtue were freely canvassed by the boldest spirits of antiquity in truth the superior advantage and necessity of the christian religion seems manifest from this particular circumstance that it has taken away every possible restraint from natural religion allowing it to exert itself to the utmost in sinding out the fundamental truths of virtue and in acquiescing in them in openly avowing and acknowledging them when revealed in extending the views and expectations of men in giving them more just and liberal sentiments and in publicly and uniformly disclaiming any intention of establishing a kingdom for its votaries or believers in this world  the doctrines of the gospel are not intended to instruct us in the knowledge of every thing which may be really useful in the present life far less of every thing which from curiosity alone we may have a mighty desire to know revelation considers mankind in their highest capacity as the rational and accountable subjects of god and as capable both of present and future happiness or misery according to their behavior its chief if not its sole design is to give us those views and impressions of our nature of our state of the perfections the counsels the laws and the government of god which under the influence of providence are the immediate and infallible means of the purity of the comfort and of the moral order rectitude and excellence of our immortal souls as corrupted and disordered we are incapable of true happiness till purified and restored to order as guilty and mortal creatures we can have no true consolation without the hopes of pardon in a future and separate state of existence as surrounded with dangers and obnoxious to every dismal apprehension we can posses no solid or permanent content but in the sincere and well grounded convictions of that gracious and righteous administration so minutely and explicity delineated in the scriptures it is evident therefore that the principal excellence and utility of revealed truths must lie or consist in the influence they have upon the sanctification and consolation of our hearts they tally exactly with the present circumstances of mankind and are admirably adapted to cure every disease every disorder of the human mind to beget to cherish and confirm every pure every virtuous every pious disposition  mankind are certainly at present in a state of the deepest corruption and depravity and at the same time apt to continue strangely insensible of the misery and danger to which under the government of infinite wisdom it necessarily renders them nothing can be conceived more fit to rouse them from their lethargy and to awaken them to a just sense of their condition than a messenger from heaven clothed with divine authority setting before them the intrinsic baseness malignity and wretchedness of vice together with the certain the dreadful the eternal consequences of continuing in it  could we enter upon a particular view of all those maladies and disorders which infest and destroy the souls of men it were easy to show that a steadfast belief of religion is in truth the most natural and the best antidote or remedy for each of them it is obvious at least that the clear and full manifestation which the gospel has given of the character of god and the laws of his moral government and of the terms of salvation through faith in the religion of his son are all finely calculated to root out the principles of superstition and all false notions destructive to the virtue and happiness of mankind and to plant in their room whatever has a natural and direct tendency to promote our virtue our perfection our felicity m    cleomenes king of sparta when suffering under misfortune was advised to kill himself by tharyceon think thou wicked man said he to show thy fortitude by rushing upon death an expedient always at hand the dastardly resource of the basest minds better than we by the fortune of arms or overpowered by numbers have left the field of battle to their enemies but he who to avoid pain or calamity or from a slavish regard to the praise or censures of men gives up the contest is overcome by his own cowardice if we are to seek death that death ought to be in action it is base to live or die only for ourselves all we gain by suicide is to get rid of present difficulty without increasing our own reputation or doing the least service to our country in hopes then we may yet be of some use to others both methinks are bound to preserve life as long as we can whenever these hopes shall have altogether abandoned us death if sought for will readily be found    of all the refined cobwebs to which sophistry has given birth this seems at once the most elaborate and the most flimsy it seems one of the first and most indisputable maxims in all sound reasoning that no ideas whatever should have a place in the premises which do not communicate a sensible energy to the conclusion but where is the connection between the beginning and end of this wiredrawn argument what have the various beautiful facts thus elegantly stated to do with a mans taking away his own life though the greatest philosopher be of no more consequence to the general system of things than an oyster and though the life of the one were in every respect as perfectly insignificant as that of the other still the meanest of mankind is not without importance in his own eyes and where is he who is guided uniformly in all his actions more by a sense of his relation to the universe at large than by the value he retains for himself or the deference he has to his own opinion  no deduction however plausible can produce conviction in any rational mind which originates in a supposition grossly absurd is it possible to conceive the author of nature capable of authenticating a deed which ultimately terminates in the total annihilation of the system by which of the creatures beneath us is the first law of their being thus daringly violated and if suicide be eligible to man under any possible misfortune or distress why not to them are not they also subject to the various miseries which arise from wayward accidents and hostile elements why therefore open a door for our escape from those evils of which others have their share to whom however it must remain for ever shut  in truth the existence of all animals depends entirely on their inviolable attachment to selfpreservation their attention to all possible means of selfdefence and sustenance is accordingly the obvious and common condition of all their natures by this great and operative principle nature has chiefly consulted her own safety our philosophers notions are so extremely hostile to her most essential institutions that she could not possibly survive a general conviction of them and in spite of all the sophistry he is master of the question here will eternally recur whether the wisdom of nature or the philosophy of our author deserves the preference    this apology for the commission arising from mans insignificance in the moral world from the reciprocation of social duty being dissolved or from the benefit resulting from the voluntary dismission of being is contrary to the soundest principles of jurisprudence to the condition of human nature and to the general establishment of things  that a man who retires from life ad libitum does no harm to society is a proposition peculiarly absurd and erroneous what is lawful for one may be lawful for all and no society can subsist in the conviction of a principle thus hostile to its being  it seems to be a maxim in human existence that no creature has a right to decide peremptorily on the importance utility or necessity of his own being there are an infinite variety of secret connections and associations in the vast system of things which the eye of created wisdom cannot explore  man is not perhaps so ignorant of anything or any creature as of himself his own system after all the art and inquisition of human ingenuity is still to him the profoundest mystery in nature his knowledge and faculties are adequate to the sphere of his duty beyond this his researches are impertinent and all his acquisitions useless he has no adequate notions what the laws of the universe are with respect to any species of existence whatever a cloud rests on the complicated movements of this great machine which baffles all the penetration of mortals and it will for ever remain impossible for man from the most complete analysis of his present situation to judge with any degree of precision of his own consequence either as a citizen of the world at large or as a member of any particular society  final causes form a system of knowledge too wonderful for man it is the perrogative of nature alone to decide upon them in the fullness of time her creative hand brought him into existence and it belongs to her alone in consequence of an arrangement equally wonderful and mysterious to dismiss him from his present mode of being this is an authority with which she alone is invested and which according to our apprehensions it is impossible for her to delegate dissolution as well as creation is hers and he who would attempt to infringe her sovereignty in this instance would usurp a prerogative which does not belong to him and become a traitor to the laws of his being nay on this extravagant and licentious hypothesis the right of assuming and relinquishing existence is made reciprocal for he who arrogates the liberty of destroying himself were he possessed of the power might also be his own creator his imaginary insignificance to society being as inconclusive in the one case as any chimerical advantage that may accidentally strike him can be in the other it is a strange doctrine which cannot be established but at the obvious expense of what seem the plainest dictates of common sense  indeed the absurdities of this daring and paradoxical doctrine are endless and infinite when we come to pronounce on the condition of human infancy and to separate childhood or nonage from a state of maturity we can scarce trace one useful or salutary consequence it is calculated to produce in society in this view children seem less adapted to serve any special or important end than even beetles gnats or flies experience however has long convinced the world of their present inestimable value from their future destination and were a legislator from the plausible pretext of their being a burden to the state to exterminate the race of mankind in the insignificant stage of infancy his decree like that of a certain monster recorded in the gospel would shock the sentiments of every nation under heaven in whom there remained only the dregs of humanity  it is not only impossible for a man to decide in any given period of the progress of his existence or what utility or consequence he may be to society but without the faculty of prescience it is still more impracticable for him to divine what purposes he may be intended to serve in the many mysterious revolations of futurity how far his mortal may be connected with his immortal life must rest with him who has the sole disposal of it but who told him that his load of misery was too much to bear that he was not able to sustain it or that his merciful father would not proportionate his sufferings to his abilities how does he know how shortlived the pressure of incumbent sorrow may prove it becomes not him to prescribe to his maker or because his evils are enormous to conclude they must be permanent rash man thy heart is in the hand of heaven and he who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb may either lighten the burden that oppresses thee or blunt the edge of that sensibility from which it derives the greatest poignancy what medicine is to the wounds of the body that resignation is to those of the soul be not deficient in this virtue and life will never prescribe a duty you cannot perform or inflict a pang which you cannot bear resignation changes the grizzly aspect of affliction turns sickness into health and converts the gloomy forebdoings of despair into the grateful presentiments of hope besides the most insignificant instruments are sometimes in the hands of eternal providence employed in bringing about the most general and beneficent revolutions it is by making weakness thus subservient to power evil to good and pain to pleasure that he who governs the world illustrates his sovereinty and omnipotence till then thou art able to comprehend the whole mysterious system of every possible existence till thou art certain that thy life is totally insignificant till thou art convinced it is not in the might of infinite power to render thee serviceable either to thyself or others counteract not the benignity of providence by suicide or in this manner by the blackest of all treasons betray thy trust and wage at fearful odds hostility against the very means and author of thy being  one very obvious consequence arising from suicide which none of its advocates appear to have foreseen and which places it in a light exceedingly gross and shocking is that it supposes every man capable not only of destroying himself but of delegating the power of committing murder to another that which he may do himself he may commission any one to do for him on this supposition no law human or divine could impeach the shedding of innocent blood and on what principle of right or expediency admit that which produces such a train of the most horrid and detestable consequences    the preceding note is perhaps the most audacious part in the whole of this very extraordinary performance in our holy religion it is expressly declared that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him that murderers shall in no wise inherit the kingdom of god and that it is the prerogative of heaven alone to kill and make alive it is a fundamental doctrine in the gospel that except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish and how are they to perform their duty who in the instant of dying contract a guilt which renders it indispensible but this horrid supposition is repugnant to the whole genius of revelation which inculates every virtue that can possibly administer to our present and future welfare it inforces obedience and resignation to the righteous government of god it inspires and produces those very dispositions which it recommends all its doctrines exhortations and duties are formed to elevate the mind to raise the affections to regulate the passions and to purge the heart of whatever is hostile to happiness in this or another life this impious slander on the christian faith is the obvious consequence of the grossest inattention to its nature and tendency it is calculated chiefly to make us happy and what happy man was ever yet chargeable with suicide in short we may as well say that because the physician does not expressly prohibit certain diseases in his prescriptions the very diseases are authenticated by the remedies devised on purpose to counteract them  immortality of the soul   the ingenuity of skepticism has been long admired but here the author boldly outdoes all his former outdoings much has been said against the authenticity of religion on the supposition that the evidence to which she appeals is not either sufficiently general or intelligible to the bulk of mankind but surely an argument is not conclusive in one case and inconclusive in another admit this reasoning against revelation to be valid and you must also admit it against our authors hypothesis there never at least was an objection started that could in the remotest degree affect the truths of the gospel more intricate metaphysical and abstracted than that by which our essayest would destroy the popular doctrine of the souls immortality how many live and die in this salutary conviction to whom these refined speculations must forever remain as unintelligible as if they had never been formed it is a sentiment so congenial to the heart of man that few of the species would choose to exist without it unable as they are to account for its origin they cordially and universally indulge it as one of their tenderest best and last feelings it inhabits alike the rudest and most polished minds and never leaves any human breast which is not either wholly engrossed by criminal pleasure deadened by selfish pursuits or perverted by false reasoning it governs with all the ardor and influence of inspiration and never meets with any opposition but from the weak the worthless or the will above what is written all the world have uniformly considered it as their last resource in every extremity and for the most part still regard and cherish the belief of it as an asylum in which their best interests are ultimately secured or deposited beyond the reach of all temporary disaster or misfortune where therefore is the probability of exterminating so popular and prevailing a notion by a concatenation of ideas which perhaps not one out of a million in any country under heaven is able to trace or comprehend    the natural perceptions of pleasure or pain cannot be said to act on the mind as one part of matter does on another the substance of the soul we do not know but are certain her ideas must be immaterial and these cannot possibly act either by contact or impulse when one body impels another the body moved is affected only by the impulse but the mind whenever roused by any pleasing or painful sensation in most cases looks round her and deliberates whether a change of state is proper or the present more eligible and moves or rests accorddingly her preceptions therefore contribute no further to action than by exciting her active powers on the contrary matter is blindly and obstinately in that state in which it is whether of motion or rest till changed by some other adequate cause suppose we rest the state of any body some external force is requisite to put it in motion and in proportion as this force is greater or small the motion must be swift or flow did not this body continue in its former state no external force would be requisite to change it nor when changed would different degrees of force be necessary to move it in different degrees of velocity when motion is impressed on any body to bring it to rest an extraforce must always be applied in proportion to the intended effect this resistance is observable in bodies both when moved in particular directions and to bear an exact proportion to the vis impressia and to the quantity of matter moved were it possible to extract from matter the qualities of solidity and extension the matter whence such qualities were extracted would no longer resist and consequently resistance is the necessary result of them which therefore in all directions must be the same the degree of resistance in any body being proportionate to the vis impressa it follows when that body is considered in any particular state whether of motion or rest the degrees of resistance must either indefinitely multiply or decrease according to all possible degrees of the moving force but when the same body is considered absolutely or without fixing any particular state the resistance is immutable and all the degrees of it which that body would exert upon the accession of any impressed force must be conceived as actually in it nor can matter have any tendency contrary to that resistance otherwise it must be equal or superior if equal the two contrary tendencies would destroy each other if superior the resistance would be destroyed thus change would eternally succeed to change without one intermediate instant so that no time would be assigned when any body was in any particular state gravitation itself the most simple and universal law seems far from being a tendency natural to matter since it is found to act internally and not in proportion to the superfices of any body which it would not do if it were only the mechanical action of matter upon matter from all this it appears that matter considered merely as such is so far from having a principle of spontaneous motion that it is stubbornly inactive and must eternally remain in the same state in which it happens to be except influenced by some other  that is some immaterial power of such a power the human soul is evidently possessed for every one is conscious of an internal activity and to dispute this would be to dispute us out of one of the most real and intimate perceptions we have  though a material automaton were allowed possible how infinitely would it fall short of that force and celerity which every one feels in himself how sluggish are all the movements which fall under our observation how slow and gradual their transitions from one part of space to another but the mind by one instantaneous effort measures the distance from pole to pole from heaven to earth from one fixed star to another and not confined within the limits of the visible creation shoots into immensity with a rapidity to which even that of lightning or sunbeams is no comparison who then shall assign a period which though depressed with so much dead weight is ever active and unconscious of fatigue or relaxation the mind is not only herself a principle of action but probably actuates the body without the assistance of any intermediate power both from the gradual command which she acquires of its members by habit and from a capacity of determining in some measure the quantity of pleasure or pain which any sensible perception can give her supposing the interposing power a spirit the same difficulty of spirit acting upon matter still remains and the volition of our own mind will as well account for the motion of the body as the formal interference of any other spiritual substance and we may as well ask why the mind is not conscious of that interposition as why she is ignorant of the means by which she communicates motion to the body    it is always bad reasoning to draw conclusions from the premises not denied by your adversary whoever yet of all the assertors of the souls immortality presumed to make a monopoly of this great privilege to thehuman race who can tell what another state of existence may be or whether every other species of animals may not possess principles as immortal as the mind of man but that mode of reasoning which militates against all our convictions solely on account of the unavoidable ignorance to which our sphere in the universe subjects us can never be satisfactory reason it is true cannot altogether solve every doubt which arises concerning this important truth but neither is there any other truth of any denomination whatever against which sophistry may not conjure up a multitude of exceptions we know no mode of existence but those of matter and spirit neither of which have uniformly and successfully defied the extreme subtilty of argumentation still a very great majority of mankind are staunch believers in both so well constituted is the present disposition of things that all the principles essential to human life and happiness continue as it is likely they ever will to operate in spite of every sort of clamor which sophistry or skepticism has raised or can raise against them    there is not a single word in all this elabarate and tedious deduction which has not been urged and refuted five hundred times our ignorance of the divine perfections as is usual with this writer is here stated as an unanswerable exception to the conclusion usually drawn from them but he very artfully overlooks that this great ignorance will be equally conclusive as applied to either side of the argument when we compare however the character of god as a wise superintendant and generous benefactor with the state in which things at present appear where virtue is  depressed and afflicted and vice apparently triumphs it will be treated with the infamy it merits and virtue receive that happiness and honor which from its own intrinsic worth it deserves and from its conformity to the nature of god it has reason to expect  this subject perhaps has been too much exaggerated and some pious men have weakly thought the best way to convince us that order and happiness prevailed in a future state was to persuade us that there was none at all in this external advantages have been taken for the only goods of human nature and because in this view all things speak the appearance of maladministration we have been taught to expect a government of rectitude and benevolence hereafter let us on the contrary heartily own that virtue is sovereignly and solely good lest by depreciating her charms we obliquely detract from the character of god himself let us confess her undowered excellence superior to all the inconveniences that may attend her even in the present situation but without allowing some difference between poverty and riches sickness and health pain and pleasure etc we shall have no foundation to preference and it will be in vain to talk of selecting where no one choice can be more agreeable or disagreeable to nature than another upon this difference therefore however it be called let the present argument proceed  if infinite goodness be the spirit and characteristic of this universal government then every advantage however inconsiderable in kind or degree must either be supposed immediately bestowed on virtue or at least that such retributions will at some time be made her as may not only render her votaries equal but superior to those of vice in proportion to their merit but how different the case is in human life history and observation may easily convince us so that one whose eyes are not intent on the character of god and the nature of virtue would often be tempted to think this world a theater merely intended for mournful spectacles and pomps of horror how many persons do we see perish by the mere wants of nature who had they been in different circumstances would have thanked god with tears of joy for the power of communicating those advantages they now implore from others in vain while at the same time they have perhaps the additional misery of seeing the most endeared relations involved in the same deplorable fate how often do we see those ties which unite the soul and body worn out by the gradual advances of a lingering disease or burst at once by the sudden efforts of unutterable agony while the unhappy sufferers had they been continued in  might have diffused happiness not only through the narrow circle of their friends and neighborhood but as extensively as their country and even the world at large how many names do we see buried in obscurity or soiled with detraction which ought to have shone the first in fame how many heroes have survived the liberties of their country or died in abortive attempts to preserve them and by their fall only left a larger field for the lawless ravages of tyranny and oppression  but were it possible how long and insuperable would be the task to enumerate all the ingredients which compose the present cup of bitterness and is this the consummation of things will supreme and essential goodness no way distinguish such as have invariably pursued his honor and the interest of his government from those who have industriously violated the order he has appointed in things who have blotted the face of nature with havoc murder and desolation and shown a constant intention to counteract all the benevolent designs of providence it is confessed that the virtuous happy in the possession of virtue alone make their exit from the present scene with blessings to the creator for having called them to existence and given them the glorious opportunity of enjoying what is in itself supremely eligible they are conscious that this felicity can receive no accession from any external luster or advantage whatever yet it seems highly necessary in the divine administration that those who have been dazzled with the false glare of prosperous wickedness should at last be undeceived that they should at last behold virtue conspicuous in all her native splendour and majesty as she shines the chief delight of god and ultimate happiness of all intelligent nature  the language of religion and our own hearts on this important argument is equally comfortable and decisive it accumulates and enforces whatever can inspire us with confidence in that god who is not the god of the dead but of the living who reigns in the invisible as well as in the visible world and whose attention to our welfare ceases not with our lives but is commensurate to the full extent of our being indeed the votaries of the souls mortality may as well be honest for once and speak out what so many fools think in their hearts for what is god to us or we to him if our connection extends but to the pitiful space allotted us in such a pitiful world as this is to be sure no absurdity will be rejected which can smother the feelings or keep the vices of profligates in countenance but if only made like worms and reptiles beneath our feet to live this moment and expire the next to struggle in a wretched life with every internal and external calamity that can assault our bodies or infest our minds to bear the mortifications of malignity and the unmerited abhorrence of those who perhaps may owe us the greatest and tenderest esteem and then sunk in everlasting oblivion our fate would stand on record in the annals of the universe an eternal exception to all that can be called good  suppose a father possessed of the most exquisite tenderness for his son delighted with his similarity of form his promising constitution his strength gracefulness and agility his undisguised emotions of filial affection with the various presages of a superior genius and understanding let us suppose this father pleased with the employment of improving his faculties and inspiring him with future hopes of happiness and dignity but that he may give him a quicker sensibility to the misfortunes of others and a more unshaken fortitude to sustain his own he often presers younger brethren and even strangers to those advantages which otherwise merit and the force of nature would determine him to bestow on so worthy an offspring let us go further and imagine if we can that this father without the least diminution of tenderness or any other apparent reason destroys his son in the bloom of life and height of expectation who would not lament the fate of such a youth with inconsolable tears doomed never more to behold the agreeable light of heaven never more to display his personal graces nor exercise his manly powers never more to feel his heart warm with benevolent regards nor taste the soultransporting pleasure of obliging and being obliged blotted at once from existence and the fair creation he sinks into silence and oblivion with all his sublime hopes disappointed all his immense desires ungratified and all his intellectual faculties unimproved without mentioning the instinctive horror which must attend such an action how absurd to reason and how inconsistent with the common feelings of humanity would it be to suppose a father capable of such a deed forbid it god forbid it nature that we should impute to the munificent father of being and happiness what even in the lowest of rational creatures would be monstrous and detestable    the truth is that form which all mankind have deemed immortal is so far from being the frailest that it seems in fact the most indissoluble and permanent of any other we know all the rational and inventtive powers of the mind happily conspire to proclaim her infinitely different in nature and superior in dignity to every possible modification of pure matter were mankind joined in society was life polished and cultivated were the sciences and arts not only of utility but elegance produced by matter by a brute mass a substance so contrary to all activity and intelligence that it seems the work of an omnipotent hand alone to connect them what judgment should we form of that principle which informed and enlightened a galileo a copernicus or a newton what inspiration taught them to place the sun in the center of this system and assign the various orbs their revolutions round him reducing motions so diverse and unequal to uniform and simple laws was it not something like that great eternal mind which first gave existence to those luminous orbs and prescribed each of them their province whence the infinite harmony and variety of sound the copious flows of eloquence the bolder graces and more inspired elevations of poetry but from a mind an immaterial being the reflected image of her allperfect creator in whom eternally dwells all beauty and excellence were man only endowed with a principle of vegetation fixed to one peculiar spot and insensible of all that passed around him we might then with some color suppose that energy if it may be so called perishable were he like animals possessed of mere vitability and qualified only to move and feel still we might have some reason to fear that in some future period of duration our creator might resume his gift of existence but can any one who pretends to the least reflection imagine that such a being as the human soul adorned with such extensive intellectual powers will ever cease to be the object of that love and care which eternally holds the universe in its embrace did she obtain such a boundless understanding merely to taste the pleasure of exercising it to catch a transient glance of its objects and perish formed as she is to operate on herself and all things round her must she cease from action while yet the mighty task is scarce begun must she lose those faculties by which she retains the past comprehends the presents and presages the future must she contemplate no more those bright impressions of divinity which are discovered in the material world nor those stronger and more animated features of the same eternal beauty which shine in her own godlike form and must she be absorbed forever in the womb of unessential nothing strange that in the view and even in the arms of infinite power and goodness a dawn so fair and promising should at one be clouded with all the horrors of eternal night such a supposition would be contrary to the whole conduct and laws of nature  the following letters on suicide are extracted from rosseaus eloisa letter cxiv to lord b  yes my lord i confess it the weight of life is too heavy for my soul i have long endured it as a burden i have lost every thing which could make it dear to me and nothing remains but irksomeness and vexation i am told however that i am not at liberty to dispose of my life without the permission of that being from whom i received it i am sensible likewise that you have a right over it by more titles than one your care has twice preserved it and your goodness is its constant security i will never dispose of it till i am certain that i may do it without a crime and till i have not the least hope of employing it for your service  you told me that i should be of use to you why did you deceive me since we have been in london so far from thinking of employing me in your concerns you have been kind enough to make me your only concern how superfluous is your obliging solicitude my lord you know i abhor a crime even worse than i detest life i adore the supreme being  i owe every thing to you i have an affection for you you are the only person on earth to whom i am attached friendship and duty may chain a wretch to this earth sophistry and vain pretenses will never detain him enlighten my understanding speak to my heart i am ready to hear you but remember that despair is not to be imposed upon  you would have me apply to the test of reason i will let us reason you desire me to deliberate in proportion to the importance of the question in debate i agree to it let us investigate truth with temper and moderation let us discuss this general proposition with the same indifference we should treat any other robeck wrote an apology for suicide before he put an end end to his life i will not after his example write a book on the subject neither am i well satisfied with that which he has penned but i hope in this discussion at least to imitate his moderation  i have for a long time meditated on this awful subject you must be sensible that i have for you know my destiny and yet i am alive the more i reflect the more i am convinced that the question may be reduced to this fundamental proposition every man has a right by nature to pursue what he thinks good and avoid what he thinks evil in all respects which are not injurious to others when our life therefore becomes a misery to ourselves and is of advantage to no one we are at liberty to put an end to our being if there is any such thing as a clear and selfevident principle certainly this is one and if this be subverted there is scarce an action in life which may not be made criminal  let us hear what the philosophers say on this subject first they consider life as something which is not our own because we hold it as a gift but because it has been given to us is it for that reason our own has not god given these sophists two arms nevertheless when they are under apprehensions of a mortification they do not scruple to amputate one or both if there be occasion by a parity of reasoning we may convince those who believe in the immortality of the soul for if i sacrifice my arm to the preservation of something more precious which is my body i have the same right to sacrifice my body to the preservation of something more valuable which is the happiness of my existence if all the gifts which heaven has bestowed are naturally designed for our good they are certainly too apt to change their nature and providence has endowed us with reason that we may discern the difference if this rule did not authorize us to choose the one and reject the other to what use would it serve among mankind  but they turn this weak objection into a thousand shapes they consider a man living upon earth as a soldier placed on duty god say they has fixed you in this world why do you quit your station without his leave but you who argue thus has he not stationed you in the town where you was born why therefore do you quit it without his leave is not misery of itself a sufficient permission whatever station providence has assigned me whether it be in a regiment or on the earth at large he intended me to stay there while i found my situation agreeable and to leave it when it became intolerable this is the voice of nature and the voice of god i agree that we must wait for an order but when i die a natural death god does not order me to quit life he takes it from me it is by rendering life insupportable that he orders me to quit it in the first case i resist with all my force in the second i have the merit of obedience  can you conceive that there are some people so absurd as to arraign suicide as a kind of rebellion against providence by an attempt to fly from his laws but we do not put an end to our being in order to withdraw ourselves from his commands but to execute them what does the power of god extend no farther than to my body is there a spot in the universe is there any being in the universe which is not subject to his power and will that power have less immediate influence over me when my being is refined and thereby becomes less compound and of nearer resemblance to the divine essence no his justice and goodness are the foundation of my hopes and if i thought that death would withdraw me from his power i would give up my resolution to die  this is one of the quibbles of the phaedo which in other respects abounds with sublime truths if your slave destroys himself says socrates to cebes would you not punish him for having unjustly deprived you of your property prithee good socrates do we not belong to god after we are dead the case you put is not applicable you ought to argue thus if you incumber your slave with a habit which confines him from discharging his duty properly will you punish him for quitting it in order to render you better service the grand error lies in making life of too great importance as if our existence depended upon it and that death was a total annihilation our life is of no consequence in the sight of god it is of no importance in the eyes of reason neither ought it to be of any in our sight when we quit our body we only lay aside an inconvenient habit is this circumstance so painful to be the occasion of so much disturbance my lord these declaimers are not in earnest their arguments are absurd and cruel for they aggravate the supposed crime as if it put a period to existence and they punish it as if that existence was eternal  with respect to platos phaedo which has furnished them with the only specious argument that has ever been advanced the question is discussed there in a very light and desultory manner socrates being condemned by an unjust judgment to lose his life in a few hours had no occasion to enter into an accurate enquiry whether he was at liberty to dispose of it himself supposing him really to have been the author of those discourses which plato ascribes to him yet believe me my lord he would have meditated with more attention on the subject had he been in circumstances which required him to reduce his speculations to practice and a strong proof that no valid objection can be drawn from that immortal work against the right of disposing of our own lives is that cato read it twice through the very night that he destroyed himself  the same sophisters make it a question whether life can ever be an evil but when we consider the multitude of errors torments and vices with which it abounds one would rather be inclined to doubt whether it can ever be a blessing guilt incessantly besieges the most virtuous of mankind every moment he lives he is in danger of falling a prey to the wicked or of being wicked himself to struggle and to endure is his lot in this world that of the dishonest man is to do evil and to suffer in every other particular they differ and only agree in sharing the miseries of life in common if you required authorities and facts i could recite you the oracles of old the answers of the sages and produce instances where acts of virtue have been recompensed with death but let us leave these considerations my lord it is to you whom i address myself and i ask you what is the chief attention of a wise man in this life except if i may be allowed the expression to collect himself inwardly and endeavor even while he lives to be dead to every object of sense the only way by which wisdom directs us to avoid the miseries of human nature is it not to detach ourselves from all earthly objects from every thing that is gross in our composition to retire within ourselves and to raise our thoughts to sublime contemplations if therefore our misfortunes are derived from our passions and errors with what eagerness should we wish for a state which will deliver us both from the one and the other what is the fate of those sons of sensuality who indiscreetly multiply their torments by their pleasures they in fact destroy their existence by extending their connections in this life they increase the weight of their crimes by their numerous attachments they relish no enjoyments but what are succeeded by a thousand bitter wants the more lively their sensibility the more acute their sufferings the stronger they are attached to life the more wretched they become  but admitting it in general a benefit to mankind to crawl upon the earth with gloomy sadness i do not mean to intimate that the human race ought with one common consent to destroy themselves and make the world one immense grave but there are miserable beings who are too much exalted to be governed by vulgar opinion to them despair and grievous torments are the passports of nature it would be as ridiculous to suppose that life can be a blessing to such men as it was absurd in the sophister possidonius to deny that is was an evil at the same time that he endured all the torments of the gout while life is agreeable to us we earnestly wish to prolong it and nothing but a sense of extreme misery can extinguish the desire of existence for we naturally conceive a violent dread of death and this dread conceals the miseries of human nature from our sight we drag a painful and melancholy life for a long time before we can resolve to quit it but when once life becomes so insupportable as to overcome the horror of death then existence is evidently a great evil and we cannot disengage ourselves from it too soon therefore though we cannot exactly ascertain the point at which it ceases to be a blessing yet at least we are certain that it is an evil long before it appears to be such and with every sensible man the right of quitting life is by a great deal precedent to the temptation  this is not all after they have denied that life can be an evil in order to bar our right of making away with ourselves they confess immediately afterward that it is an evil by reproaching us with want of courage to support it according to them it is cowardice to withdraw ourselves from pain and trouble and there are none but dastards who destroy themselves o rome thou victrix of the world what a race of cowards did thy empire produce let arria eponina lucretia be of the number they were women but brutus cassius and thou great and divine cato who did share with the gods the adoration of an astonished world thou whose sacred and august presence animated the romans with holy zeal and made tyrants tremble little did thy proud admirers imagine that paltry rhetoricians immured in the dusty corner of a college would ever attempt to prove that thou were a coward for having preferred death to a shameful existence  o the dignity and energy of your modern writers how sublime how intrepid are you with your pens but tell me thou great and valiant hero who do so courageously decline the battle in order to endure the pain of living somewhat longer when a spark of fire lights upon your hand why do you withdraw it in such haste how are you such a coward that you dare not bear the scorching of fire nothing you say can oblige you to endure the burning spark and what obliges me to endure life was the creation of a man of more difficulty to providence than that of a straw and is not both one and the other equally the work of his hands  without doubt it is an evidence of great fortitude to bear with firmness the misery which we cannot shun none but a fool however will voluntarily endure evils which he can avoid without a crime and it is very often a great crime to suffer pain unnecessarily he who has not resolution to deliver himself from a miserable being by a speedy death is like one who would rather suffer a wound to mortify than trust to a surgeons knife for his cure come thou worthy  out off this leg which endangers my life i will see it done without shrinking and will give that hero leave to call me coward who suffers his leg to mortify because he dares not undergo the same operation  i acknowledge that there are duties owing to others the nature of which will not allow every man to dispose of his life but in return how many are there which give him a right to dispose of it let a magistrate on whom the welfare of a nation depends let a father of a family who is bound to procure subsistence for his children let a debtor who might ruin his creditors let these at all events discharge their duty admitting a thousand other civil and domestic relations to oblige an honest and unfortunate man to support the misery of life to avoid the greater evil of doing injustice is it therefore under circumstances totally different incumbent on us to preserve a life oppressed with a swarm of miseries when it can be of no service but to him who has not courage to die kill me my child says the decrepid savage to his son who carries him on his shoulders and bends under his weight the enemy is at hand go to battle with thy brethren go and preserve thy children and do not suffer thy helpless father to fall alive into the hands of those whose relations he has mangled though hunger sickness and poverty those domestic plagues more dreadful than savage enemies may allow a wretched cripple to consume in a sick bed the provisions of a family which can scarce subsist itself yet he who has no connections whom heaven has reduced to the necessity of living alone whose wretched existence can produce no good why should not he at least have the right of quitting a station where his complaints are troublesome and his sufferings of no benefit  weigh these considerations my lord collect these arguments and you will find that they may be reduced to the most simple of natures rights of which no man of sense ever yet entertained a doubt in fact why should we be allowed to cure ourselves of the gout and not to get rid of the misery of life do not both evils proceed from the same hand to what purpose is it to say that death is painful are drugs agreeable to be taken no nature revolts against both let them prove therefore that it is more justifiable to cure a transient disorder by the application of remedies than to free ourselves from an incurable evil by putting an end to our life and let them show how it can be less criminal to use the bark for a fever than to take opium for the stone if we consider the object in view it is in both cases to free ourselves from painful sensations if we regard the means both one and the other are equally natural if we consider the repugnance of our nature it operates equally on both sides if we attend to the will of providence can we struggle against any evil of which it is not the author can we deliver ourselves from any torment which the hand of god has not inflicted what are the bounds which limit his power and when is resistance lawful are we then to make no alteration in the condition of things because every thing is in the state he appointed must we do nothing in this life for fear of infringing his laws or is it in our power to break them if we would no my lord the occupation of man is more great and noble god did not give him life that he should supinely remain in a state of constant inactivity but he gave him freedom to act conscience to will and reason to choose what is good he has constituted him sole judge of all his actions he has engraved this precept in his heart do whatever you conceive to be for your own good provided you thereby do no injury to others if my sensations tell me that death is eligible i resist his orders by an obstinate resolution to live for by making death desirable he directs me to put an end to my being  my lord i appeal to your wisdom and candor what more infallible maxims can reason deduce from religion with respect to suicide if christians have adopted contrary tenets they are neither drawn from the principles of religion nor from the only sureguide the scriptures but borrowed from the pagan philosophers lactantius and augustine the first who propagated this new doctrine of which jesus christ and his apostles take no notice ground their arguments entirely on the reasoning of phaedo which i have already controverted so that the believers who in this respect think they are supported by the authority of the gospel are in fact only countenaced by the authority of plato in truth where do we find throughout the whole bible any law against suicide or so much as a bare disapprobation of it and is it not very unaccountable that among the instances produced of persons who devoted themselves to death we do not find the least word of improbation against examples of this kind nay what is more the instance of samsons voluntary death is authorized by a miracle by which he revenges himself of his enemies would this miracle have been displayed to justify a crime and would this man who lost his strength by suffering himself to be seduced by the allurements of a woman have recovered it to commit an authorized crime as if god himself would practice deceit on men  thou shall do no murder says the decalogue what are we to infer from this if this commandment is to be taken literally we must not destroy malefactors nor our enemies and moses who put so many people to death was a bad interpreter of his own precept if there are any exceptions certainly the first must be in favor of suicide because it is exempt from any degree of violence and injustice the two only circumstances which can make homicide criminal and because nature moreover has in this respect thrown sufficient obstacles in the way  but still they tell us we must patiently endure the evils which god inflicts and make a merit of our sufferings this application however of the maxims of christianity is very ill calculated to satisfy our judgment man is subject to a thousand troubles his life is a complication of evils and he seems to have been born only to suffer reason directs him to shun as many of these evils as he can avoid and religion which is never in contradiction to reason approves of his endeavors but how inconsiderable is the account of these evils in comparison with those he is obliged to endure against his will it is with respect to these that a merciful god allows man to claim the merit of resistance he receives the tribute he has been pleased to impose as a voluntary homage and he places our resignation in this life to our profit in the next true repentance is derived from nature if man endures whatever he is obliged to suffer he does in this respect all that god requires of him and if any one is so inflated with pride as to attempt more he is a madman who ought to be confined or an impostor who ought to be punished let us therefore without scruple fly from all the evils we can avoid there will still be too many left for us to endure let us without remorse quit life itself when it becomes a torment to us since it is in our own power to do it and that in so doing we neither offend god nor man if we would offer a sacrifice to the supreme being is it nothing to undergo death let us devote to god that which he demands by the voice of reason and into his hands let us peaceably surrender our souls  such are the liberal precepts which good sense dictates to every man and which religion authorizes a strange letter this for the discussion of such a subject do men argue so coolly on a question of this nature when they examine it on their own accounts is the letter a forgery or does the author reason only with an intent to be refuted what makes our opinion in this particular dubious is the example of robeck which he cites and which seems to warrant his own robeck deliberated so gravely that he had patience to write a book a large voluminous weighty and dispassionate book and when he had concluded according to his principles that it was lawful to put an end to out being he destroyed himself with the same composure that he wrote let us beware of the prejudices of the times and of particular countries when suicide is out of fashion we conclude that none but madmen destroy themselves and all the efforts of courage appear chimerical to dastardly minds every one judges of others by himself nevertheless how many instances are there well attestested of men in every other respect perfectly discreet who without remorse rage or despair have quitted life for no other reason than because it was a burden to them and have died with more composure than they lived  let us apply these precepts to ourselves you have condescended to disclose your mind to me i am acquainted with your uneasiness you do not endure less than myself and your troubles like mine are incurable and they are the more remediless as the laws of honor are more immutable than those of fortune you bear them i must confess with fortitude virtue supports you advance but one step farther and she disengages you you entreat me to suffer my lord i dare importune you to put an end to your sufferings and i leave you to judge which of us is most dear to the other  why should we delay doing that which we must do at last shall we wait till old age and decrepid baseness attach us to life after they have robbed it of its charms and till we are doomed to drag an infirm and decrepid body with labor and ignominy and pain we are at an age when the soul has vigor to disengage itself with ease from its shackles and when a man knows how to die as he ought when farther advanced in years he suffers himself to be torn from life which he quits with reluctance let us take advantage of this time when the tedium of life makes death desirable and let us tremble for fear it should come in all its horrors at the moment when we could wish to avoid it i remember the time when i prayed to heaven only for a single hour of life and when i should have died in despair if it had not been granted ah what a pain it is to burst asunder the ties which attach our hearts to this world and how advisable it is to quit life the moment the connection is broken i am sensible my lord that we are both worthy of a purer mansion virtue points it out and destiny invites us to seek it may the friendship which invites us preserve our union to the latest hour o what a pleasure for two sincere friends voluntary to end their days in each others arms to intermingle their latest breath and at the same instant to give up the soul which they shared in common what pain what regret can infect their last moments what do they quit by taking leave of the world they go together they quit nothing  letter cxv answer thou art distracted my friend by a fatal passion be more discreet do not give counsel whilst thou stands so much in need of advice i have known greater evils than yours i am armed with fortitude of mind i am an englishman and not afraid to die but i know how to live and suffer as becomes a man i have seen death near at hand and have viewed it with too much indifference to go in search of it  it is true i thought you might be of use to me my affection stood in need of yours your endeavors might have been serviceable to me your understanding might have enlightened me in the most important concern of my life if i do not avail myself of it who are you to impute it to where is it what is become of it what are your capable of of what use can you be in your present condition what service can i expect from you a senseless grief renders you stupid and unconcerned thou art no man thou art nothing and if i did not consider what thou might be i cannot conceive any thing more abject  there is need of no other proof than your letter itself formerly i could discover in you good sense and truth your sentiments were just your reflections proper and i liked you not only from judgment but choice for i considered your influence as an additional motive to excite me to the study of wisdom but what do i perceive now in the arguments of your letter with which you appear to be so highly satisfied a wretched and perpetual sophistry which in the erroneous deviations of your reason shows the disorder of your mind and which i would not stoop to refute if i did not commiserate your delirium  to subvert all your reasoning with one word i would only ask you a single question you who believe in the existence of a god in the immortality of the soul and in the freewill of man you surely cannot suppose that an intelligent being is embodied and stationed on the earth by accident only to exist to suffer and to die it is certainly most probable that the life of man is not without some design some end some moral object i entreat you to give me a direct answer to this point after which we will deliberately examine your letter and you will blush to have written it  but let us wave all general maxims about which we often hold violent disputes without adopting any of them in practice for in their applications we always find some particular circumstances which makes such an alteration in the state of things that every one thinks himself dispensed from submitting to the rules which he prescribes to others and it is well known that every man who establishes general principles deems them obligatory on all the world himself excepted once more let us speak to you in particular  you believe that you have a right to put an end to your being your proof is of a very singular nature because i am disposed to die say you i have a right to destroy myself this is certainly a very convenient argument for villains of all kinds they ought to be very thankful to you for the arms with which you have furnished them there can be no crimes which according to your arguments may not be justified by the temptation to perpetrate them and as soon as the impetuosity of passion shall prevail over the horror of guilt their disposition to do evil will be considered as a right to commit it  is it lawful for you therefore to quit life i should be glad to know whether you have begun to live what was you placed here on earth to do nothing in this world did not heaven when it gave you existence give you some task or employment if you have accomplished your days work before evening rest yourself for the remainder of the day you have a right to do it but let us see your work what answer are you prepared to make the supreme judge when he demands an account of your time tell me what can you say to him  i have seduced a virtuous girl i have forsaken a friend in distress thou unhappy wretch point out to me that just man who can boast that he has lived long enough let me learn from him in what manner i ought to have spent my days to be at liberty to quit life  you enumerate the evils of human nature you are not ashamed to exhaust commonplace topics which have been hackneyed over a hundred times and you conclude that life is an evil but search examine into the order of things and see whether you can find any good which is not intermingled with evil does it therefore follow that there is no good in the universe and can you confound what is in its own nature evil with that which is only an evil accidentally you have confessed yourself that the transitory and passive life of man is of no consequence and only bears respect to matter from which he will soon be disencumbered but his active and moral life which ought to have most influence over his nature consists in the exercise of free will life is an evil to a wicked man in prosperity and a blessing to an honest man in distress for it is not its casual modification but its relation to some final object which makes it either good or bad after all what are these cruel torments which force you to abandon life do you imagine that under your affected impartiality in the enumeration of the evils of this life i did not discover that you was ashamed to speak of your own trust me and do not at once abandon every virtue preserve at least your wonted sincerity and speak thus openly to you friend i have lost all hope of seducing a modest woman i am oliged therefore to be a man of virtue i had much rather die  you are weary of living and you tell me that life is an evil sooner or later you will receive consolation and then you will say life is a blessing you will speak with more truth though not with better reason for nothing will have altered but yourself begin the alteration then from this day and since all the evil you lament is in the disposition of your mind correct your irregular appetites and do not set your house on fire to avoid the trouble of putting it in order  i endure misery say you is it in my power to avoid suffering but this is changing the state of the question for the subject of enquiry is not whether you suffer but whether your life is an evil let us proceed you are wretched you naturally endeavor to extricate yourself from misery let us see whether for that purpose it is necessary to die  let us for a moment examine the natural tendency of the afflictions of the mind as in direct opposition to the evils of the body the two substances being of contrary nature the latter become worse and more inveterate the longer they continue and at length utterly destroy this mortal machine the former on the contrary being only external and transitory modifications of an immortal and uncompounded essence are insensibly effaced and leave the mind in its original form which is not susceptible of alteration grief disquietude regret and despair are evils of short duration which never take root in the mind and experience always falsifies that bitter reflection which makes us imagine our misery will have no end i will go farther i cannot imagine that the vices which contaminate us are more inherent in our nature than the troubles we endure i not only believe that they perish with the body which gives them birth but i think beyond all doubt that a longer life would be sufficient to reform mankind and that many ages of youth would teach us that nothing is preferable to virtue  however this may be as the greatest part of our physical evils are incessantly increasing the acute pains of the body when they are incurable may justify a mans destroying himself for all his faculties being distracted with pain and the evil being without remedy he has no longer any use either of his will or of his reason he ceases to be a man before he is dead and does nothing more in taking away his life than quit a body which incumbers him and in which his soul is no longer resident  but it is otherwise with the afflictions of the mind which let them be ever so acute always carry their remedy with them in fact what is it that makes any evil intolerable nothing but its duration the operations of surgery are generally much more painful than the disorders they cure but the pain occasioned by the latter is lasting that of the operation is momentary and therefore preferable what occasion is there therefore for any operation to remove troubles which die of course by their duration the only circumstance which could render them insupportable is it reasonable to apply such desperate remedies to evils which expire of themselves to a man who values himself on his fortitude and who estimates years at their real value of two ways by which he may extricate himself from the same troubles which will appear preferable death or time have patience and you will be cured what would you desire more  oh you will say it doubles my afflictions to reflect that they will cease at last this is the vain sophistry of grief an apophthegm void of reason of propriety and perhaps of sincerity what an absurd motive of despair is the hope of terminating misery no my lord we do not put an end to misery by these means but rather fill the measure of affliction by bursting asunder the last ties which attach us to felicity when we regret what was dear to us grief itself still attaches us to the object we lament which is a state less deplorable than to be attached to nothing  even allowing this fantastical reflection who would not choose to increase the present pain for a moment under the assurance of putting an end to it as we scarify a wound in order to heal it and admitting any charm in grief to make us in love with suffering when we release ourselves from it by putting an end to our being do we not at that instant incur all that we apprehend hereafter  reflect thoroughly young man what are ten twenty thirty years in competition with immortality pain and pleasure pass like a shadow life slides away in an instant it is nothing of itself its value depends on the use we make of it the good that we have done is all that remains and it is that alone which marks its importance  therefore do not say any more that your existence is an evil since it depends upon yourself to make it a blessing and if it be an evil to have lived this is an additional reason for prolonging life do not pretend neither to say any more that you are at liberty to die for it is as much as to say that you have power to alter your nature that you have a right to revolt against the author of your being and to frustrate the end of your existence but when you add that your death does injury to no one do you recollect that you make this declaration to your friend  your death does injury to no one i understand you you think the loss i shall sustain by your death of no importance you deem my affliction of no consequence i will urge to you no more the rights of friendship which you despise but are there not obligations still more dear obligations more dear than those of friendship is it a philosopher who talks thus but this affected sophist was of an amorous disposition  which ought to induce you to preserve your life if there be a person in the world who loved you to that degree as to be unwilling to survive you and whose happiness depends on yours do you think that you have no obligations to her will not the execution of your wicked design disturb the peace of a mind which has been with such difficulty restored to its former innocence are not you afraid to add fresh torments to a heart of such sensibility are not you apprehensive left your death should be attended with a loss more fatal which would deprive the world and virtue itself of its brightest ornament and if she should survive you are not you afraid to rouse up remorse in her bosom which is more grievous to support than life itself thou ungrateful friend thou indelicate lover will thou always be taken up wholly with thyself will thou always think on thy own troubles alone have thou no regard for the happiness of one who was so dear to thee and cannot thou resolve to live for her who was willing to die with thee  you talk of the duties of a magistrate and of a father of a family and because you are not under those circumstances you think yourself absolutely free and are you then under no obligations to society to whom you are indebted for your preservation your talents your understanding do you owe nothing to your native country and to those unhappy people who may need your existence o what an accurate calculation you make among the obligations you have enumerated you have only omitted those of a man and of a citizen where is the virtuous patriot who refused to enlist under a foreign prince because his blood ought not to be spilt but in the service of his country and who now in a fit of despair is ready to shed it against the express prohibition of the laws the laws the laws young man did any wise man ever despise them socrates though innocent out of regard to them refused to quit his prison you do not scruple to violate them by quitting life unjustly and you ask what injury do i  you endeavor to justify yourself by example you presume to mention the romans you talk of the romans it becomes you indeed to cite those illustrious names tell me did brutus die a lover in despair and did cato plunge the dagger in his breast for his mistress thou weak and abject man what resemblance is there between cato and thee show me the common standard between that sublime soul and thine ah vain wretch hold thy peace i am afraid to profane his name by a vindication of his conduct at that august and sacred name every friend to virtue should bow to the ground and honor the memory of the greatest hero in silence  how ill you have selected your examples and how meanly you judge of the romans if you imagine that they thought themselves at liberty to quit life so soon as it became a burden to them recur to the excellent days of that republic and see whether you will find a single citizen of virtue who thus freed himself from the discharge of his duty even after the most cruel misfortunes when regulus was on his return to carthage did he prevent the torments which he knew were preparing for him by destroying himself what would not posthumus have given when obliged to pass under the yoke at caudium had this resource been justifiable how much did even the senate admire that effort of courage which enabled the consul varro to survive his defeat for what reason did so many generals voluntary surrender themselves to their enemies they to whom ignominy was so dreadful and who were so little afraid of dying it was because they considered their blood their life and their latest breath as devoted to their country and neither shame nor misfortune could dissuade them from this sacred duty but when the laws were subverted and the state became a prey to tyranny the citizens resumed their natural liberty and the right they had over their own lives when rome was no more it was lawful for the romans to give up their lives they had discharged their duties on earth they had no longer any country to defend they were therefore at liberty to dispose of their lives and to obtain that freedom for themselves which they could not recover for their country after having spent their days in the service of expiring rome and in fighting for the defense of its laws they died great and virtuous as they had lived and their death was an additional tribute to the glory of the roman name since none of them beheld a sight above all others most dishonorable that of a true citizen stooping to an usurper  but thou what art thou what have thou done do thou think to excuse thyself on account of thy obscurity does thy weakness exempt thee from thy duty and because thou have neither rank nor distinction in thy country art thou less subject to the laws it becomes you vastly to presume to talk of dying while you owe the service of your life to your equals know that a death such as you meditate is shameful and surreptitious it is a theft committed on mankind in general before you quit life return the benefits you have received from every individual but say you i have no attachments i am useless in the world o thou young philosopher art thou ignorant that thou can not move a single step without finding some duty to fulfill and that every man is useful to society even by means of his existence alone  hear me thou rash young man thou art dear to me i commiserate thy errors if the least sense of virtue still remains in thy breast attend and let me teach thee to be reconciled to life whenever thou art tempted to quit it say to thyself  let me do at least one good action before i die then go in search for one in a state of indigence whom thou may relieve for one under misfortunes whom thou may comfort for one under oppression whom thou may defend introduce to me those unhappy wretches whom my rank keeps at a distance do not be afraid of misusing my parle or my credit make free with them distribute my fortune make me rich if this consideration restrains you today it will restrain you tomorrow if to morrow it will
