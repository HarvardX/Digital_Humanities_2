and the originality and truth of his observations  new thoughts on medical electricity dear sir feb         having lately met with as remarkable a case in medical electricity as perhaps has yet appeared in the world i give myself the pleasure of sending you an account of it  in the month of june      a young person had the misfortune to break her right arm which as it was only a simple fracture was easily reduced but unhappily the bandage being made too tight the arm was soon invaded with a very severe pain which in about twentyfour hours became intolerable a surgeon happening to pass by the house in which the patient then was was called in who immediately cut open the bandage when great part of the arm appeared to be in a gangrenous state and a mortification had actually begun at the elbow these symptoms however were without much difficulty overcome by proper applications and the cure of the fracture went on very well but from that time the use of the arm was lost about three months after this the whole arm and hand began to waste and gradually became an object too full of distress to be beheld without exciting the emotions of surprise and compassion a large and hard knob was formed on the forepart of the arm a little above the bend of the elbow and another on the hinderside near the upper head of the shoulder bone the fracture itself was near the middle of the bone the whole arm was so weak that when it hung by her side she was not able to raise it without the assistance of the other and when supported in an horizontal posture the wrist fell as in a palsy the fingers were drawn backwards to such a degree that the heads of the fingerbones were forced out of the sockets where they join to the palm of the hand at the same time the other joints of all the fingers were contracted forwards so that the hand could not be opened or shut and according to her own expression looked more like a birds claw than a hand both the hand and arm were almost void of sensation except of an obtuse pain at times with a pricking numbness and so emaciated as to become a mere skeleton every application of baths liniments fomentations cataplasms etc etc was tried without the least appearance of success but it was observed that those of the astringent kind seemed to be most injurious and the calamity was much heightened by the melancholy prospect of it is growing continually worse to which was added the mortification of the patients being assured that if she did not find relief in a very little time she would have a completely withered arm in this deplorable situation she remained at the beginning of march    0 when the surgeon under whose care she was advised her to try the effect of electricity adding that he was thoroughly persuaded that nothing within the practice of surgery could possibly be of any service to her on this she went to london and after consulting several surgeons some of whom very earnestly recommended it and others as earnestly dissuaded her from it at length determined to put herself under the direction of mr long of little compton street soho an experienced practitioner who has made medical electricity great part of his study and employment for many years this gentleman heartily told her that her case appeared so bad that he could not give her any great hopes of success that she might try if she pleased but if she should receive benefit it would be next to a miracle  willing to try though in a manner without hope about the latter end of the same month she began to enter on a course at first the operation was carried on very gently as by drawing the electric stream small sparks and slight shocks which were attended with no visible alteration the operator then proceeded to electrify more sharply after which she soon began to find some small signs of relief thus she went on for about six months continuing to be electrified every day sundays excepted the method in general was to draw sparks with a large and powerful machine on one day and to give strong shocks another day both which were continued as long as the patient could well endure it i cannot determine how strong the shocks were but by the patients own description some of them might be from a threepint or twoquart jar full charged sometimes the number of shocks amounted to one hundred and fifty and even to two hundred so insensible was the arm at that time they were however sufficient in number and strength to make the whole limb swell exceedingly the effect was a slow improvement of the sensation use and strength of the limb insomuch that by michaelmas    0 her condition was become quite happy in comparison of what it had been she could now lift the arm without assistance move the elbow and wrist and had some power of moving the fingers the heads of the fingerbones were reduced into their sockets but the hand remained about half open without the ability of extending or clenching the fingers the fleshy parts of the arm were visibly increased in bulk as were those of the hand though in a less degree at this time her affairs calling her into the country the electrification was discontinued until about the middle of january      when the patient came into my neighborhood on a visit to a relation and being within a convenient distance of my house an opportunity presented itself for carrying on the operation which i have endeavored to perform in the same manner as it was practiced in london as near as i can collect from the patients account it is now about six weeks since i began and i have the satisfaction of perceiving the arm and especially the hand improved in a degree that has exceeded my warmest expectation the power of clenching and extending the fingers is wonderfully increased and the whole limb better covered with flesh about a week ago the muscles on the back of the arm were upon moving the fingers observed for the first time to work under the skin and she now began to make a feeble use of her needle to lace her stays and dress her head and remains in a pleasing expectation of receiving further benefit from the continuation of the same means that have hitherto been so successfully applied  from the aforementioned appearances particularly the wasting of the limb may we not conclude that not only the muscles and tendons of the os humeri but also the great nerve itself was injured especially if it be considered that the patient is a person of a very slender make her arms being so exceeding small that it would require no violent pressure to injure every muscle tendon and nerve between the skin and the bone there was undoubtedly a violent tension of the muscles and tendons if not of the great nerve itself to which electricity seems to be a remedy peculiarly adapted for my own part i never could perceive any great benefit arising from it unless there was reason to suspect something of this kind and in cases of this nature i do not recollect a single instance in all my practice where it sailed in affording more or less relief in a slight burn or scald it is well known there is a tension on the skin and i will venture to say that electricity properly applied will afford more immediate ease to the pain occasioned thereby than any thing contained in the whole materia medica  i am sir etc  from the date of the foregoing letter till past the middle of april following the patient whose case is related therein continued the electrification with little or no alteration to the afflicted limb the weather being all that time very dry and the wind north or northeast but about the   st or   nd the weather becoming of a sudden remarkably mild and soft as remarkable and sudden a change was experienced by her which exceedingly flattered our hopes the numbness and pricking sensation which had never ceased from the time the misfortune happened was now entirely gone off but as the fine mild weather did not last long and the wind returned into the northeast the disagreeable numbness returned with it and has ever since continued in a greater or less degree in proportion as the air has been more or less cold sharp or dry  it is further observable that the limb during that season and at times ever since has been more painful than when the calamity was at the worst for from christmas      till march      notwithstanding the great improvements made in the summer of    0 so great was its insensibility that all kinds of weather were alike to it at the same time the patient began to be more shy of the electric stroke which obliged us to diminish the strength and number of the shocks at the latter end of june      a free perspiration first appeared on the hand and fingers and the skin which had hitherto wore a very shining polish began to look more like that of the other hand on the  th of july we were agreeably surprised on discovering the fingers to have a much greater power of extension than usual since which time nothing has happened that requires particular description it is sufficient to say in general that the limb continues improving in all respects that these improvements are seldom observed to be regularly gradual but appear mostly on a sudden and after such long intervals that we more than once began to despair of farther success and that the progress of the cure is always very much advanced or retarded by good or bad weather  that the powers of nature alone were not sufficient to work such wonderful alterations as i have described appears very plain from the state of the arm between michaelmas    0 and the middle of january      in which space of time the patient declares she did not perceive the arm grow better or worse during the omission of electricity that omission therefore seems to be a very fortunate circumstance as it enables us to determine with a great degree of certainty the vast importance of electricity in medicine  at the latter end of the last summer the writer of the preceding letter had an opportunity of seeing his friend to whom it was addressed when the conversation turning on medical electricity furnished some hints that occasioned a second letter as follows  letter ii dear sir jan  0      our last conversation which turned chiefly on the different and opposite success of electricity on contracted limbs has to me been a subject of much consideration and i am not without hope that such seemingly various effects may be accounted for without imputing any uncertainty to the operation itself  we are to observe that a limb or joint may become contracted from opposite causes either from a real injury or morbid contraction of a muscle or from the mere relaxation of its antagonist the consideration of this difference you well know to be of the utmost importance in practice and it often requires great skill and attention to make the distinction if a muscle or tendon be relaxed in any great degree its antagonist may by its own natural contractile power shrink in such a manner as to give the limb a srightful appearance and if this should be mistaken for a tension or unnatural contraction the treatment will consequently be a perverse one and instead of relief the patient will most probably find his malady increased hence we may see why the same method of treatment shall sometimes succeed and sometimes fail in cases apparently the same and also why complaints seemingly different shall often yield to the very same medicines and hence may arise that uncertainty of success so frequently attributed to electricity by those who are no friends to it electricity as well as other medicines may be used contrary to the true intention of cure there is however one happy circumstance attending it viz that if it should happen to be used improperly unless in a very imprudent manner there is not so much danger in it as may be imagined a fair proof of this is that noted case mentioned by diverse writers of a girl who had a palsy in her right arm which was twice increased by electric shocks and as often restored to the state in which it was before electrification now if we consider electricity as a relaxer of the solids we may i presume reasonably enough conclude the true state of that case to be this the first complaint was a relaxation consequently the electricity was ill applied yet notwithstanding as the accounts declare the shocks were pretty fevere it did but a temporary damage for the fibers although much injured before had elasticity sufficient to recover their former debilitated state whence we may infer that in cases of uncertainty a moderate degree of electricity may nay sometimes ought to be applied were it only to find out whether the distortion arose from an unnatural tension of one muscle or an unnatural distension of another hence also appears a reason why even in cases wherein electricity is properly applied it can afford but a temporary relief as in persons whose fibers are become habitually rigid from the several causes of time heats colds labor strains hard drinking etc etc in such subjects nothing more than a temporary relief can reasonably be expected because the dry impervious fibers will inevitably return to their rigid state for want of that vital warmth and lubricating moisture which are necessary to preserve their flexibility but in young and healthy persons the contracted shall be restored to their due tone provided the injury be not too great of which there are many authentic proofs and it has often happened that when the injury has been too great to admit of a perfect cure a partial one has been obtained which never relapsed and this after the most approved remedies had been tried in vain from all which i infer that where there is already too great a relaxation of the solids electricity is at best but useless  experience proves electricity to be a great promoter of the purulent discharge in issues blisters etc which discharge arises from the relaxation of the mouths of the cuticular vessels after the tension is destroyed for otherwise they discharge only a thin watery humor or rather no moisture at all from whence it is plain that electricity ought not to be administered in fluxes proceeding from weakness except as sometimes happens there be a tension on the injured vessels mr cavallo observes that before fluxes discover any signs of amendment from electricity they appear to be increased  but perhaps you will say if electricity be so efficacious in destroying tensions as is pretended it should seem to be a probable means of cure for ardent fevers pleurisies inflammatory rheumatisms and such kind of disorders in which there is a manifest tension on the vessels  but it ought to be considered that in such cases as these there is something more than bare tension there is a latent cause which produces and continues the tension and counteracts the operation of the electricity electricity will soon remove the tension and pain attending a slight burn or scald here the cause of the tension and pain i e the fire or scalding liquor has already ceased to act upon the affected part and the cause being taken away the effect is soon made to cease on the other hand it can give little or no relief in bites or stings of venomous animals so long as the cause of the tension and pain i e the injected poison remains indeed i cannot say what a long continued use of electricity might bring about by relaxing the capillaries and promoting perspiration or the impeded circulation or how far it may contribute to dissolve the viscidities of the blood and humors but as such tedious operations are in these cases hardly practicable on account of the pain weakness and impatience of the sick it seems to be scarce worth our while to consider much about it my humble opinion is that such attempts would serve only to bring a very valuable acquisition in medicine into disrepute  in old callous ulcers electricity is said to have proved efficacious in such i presume as were owing to too tight and continued bandages or other mismanagement rather than a bad habit of body but for the reasons given before i would not wish a practitioner to risk the credit of his art by applying it to such as arise from a malignity of the humors  it is also said to be a good remedy for sore throats and i verily believe it may but it must be for such as spring from some recent cause such as sudden gold etc which may bring on a tension that may be removed before the humors become vitiated  in like manner perhaps it may be of wonderful service in preventing the excruciating pains of the rheumatism i mean of the true acute inflammatory rheumatic fever a distemper which seems to have it is beginning in the solids viz a tension caused by sudden cold especially after the body has been much heated  it has been observed by men of great skill that this is a disorder that seldom or never attacks any but those who are otherwise sound and healthy and for my own part i doubt not but that whoever is afflicted with it might if he paid due attention tell when and how he contracted it supposing this to be true it is highly probable that could the tension of the fibers be removed before the blood and humors become inflamed the disease would be eradicated while in embryo for a little experience might be sufficient to convince any one of the great power electricity has to take off that rigidity so commonly felt after violent exercise in a cold air  so great a stress has of late been laid on drawing or throwing the electric stream with points that shocks and even sparks have been almost laid aside as useless or dangerous there are certainly many cases in which gentle methods are highly proper and the rougher kinds of treatment both painful and dangerous as when the affected part is very tender such as an eye ear etc also if the tension be slight or easily removable it is unnecessary to torment the patient with strong shocks or even sparks but when the tension is obstinate and not situated in a tender part the degree of electricity ought to be proportioned thereto as far as the patient can bear it there are certainly many cases in which the very gentle kinds of electricity would signify little or nothing i have often relieved very slight burns or scalds by only drawing the stream but i had lately an opportunity of observing that method fail in a scald that was somewhat severe i drew the stream a long time to no purpose at length i proceeded to draw sparks which soon had the desired effect this scald was so great that a blister arose before the person who received it could come to the machine although the accident happened in the house electricity in this case effected no other cure than relieving the pain the blister was healed as other blisters usually are  a person who lives in a neighboring parish about a year ago broke his leg and was confined to his bed eleven weeks the fracture being a bad one he was obliged to lie all that time in one posture the consequence of which was an anchylosis at the knee of the same leg which continued for many weeks after he left his bed without the least perceiveable alteration as soon as he was able to ride he was brought to me and electrified twice every day for a fortnight the method i used was to draw sparks and give four or five moderate shocks i e from a pint vial about onethird charged the success answered our expectation every operation being attended with a visible improvement except one wherein i purposely omitted the shocks for the sake of experiment at the end of the fortnight the knee which was at first nearly straight was become so flexible that he could bring the sole of his foot to the ground while sitting in a common chair he has been with me three times since and not without more of less improvement according to the state of the weather which i always found to be of great importance toward a cure but the grand proof of the great expediency and even necessity of strong shocks in obstinate tensions of the larger nerves and tendons was exhibited in the case of the contracted arm of which i have already given you an account  it has been said by an eminent physician a friend to medical electricity that he never knew the cure advance after the patient had undergone six or seven times of trial with submission i think that either the patients were not proper subjects for electrification or that the electrification was not sufficiently continued  if the rigidity tension etc be too stubborn to admit of a perfect cure on the forementioned number of trials the practitioner may almost depend upon it that he will not observe any farther improvement for a considerable time nay in some cases for many weeks of this i have already produced a remarkable instance in the patient who is the subject of my first letter and of whom i then took notice that the improvements did by no means proceed in a regular manner but by sudden fits or starts and indeed i must acknowledge that had it not been for the patients amazing perseverance which i sometimes took for obstinacy the affair had been long ago given up something like this i have observed in another case but that already related is sufficient and here i desire leave to recommend one thing to your serious attention viz to consider whether under such circumstances it be better to continue the electrification constantly as a preparative toward a farther improvement or when it is found that the part will suffer no greater degree of distension for the present to let it rest a while that nature may have time to supply the newstretched fibers with nourishment and sit them for distension again this is an object of great importance for if as i am most inclined to believe the omission be no hindrance to the progress of the cure it will be happy for those patients whose occupations and circumstances will not allow of a long and constant attendance as well as for those of all degrees who will in a great measure be freed from suffering perpetually a disagreeable sensation  from the foregoing considerations we may discover the reason why even in cases to which electricity is well adapted it is more difficult to perfect a cure than to begin it for at the first application when the fibers are in the most stiff and rigid state the inflating or distending power of the electricity will have the greatest influence upon them the effects of which will naturally decrease in proportion as the fibers grow pliable because through their newacquired elasticity they will become capable of eluding the force a smith with a stroke of his great hammer or sledge can without much difficulty bend or break a stiff iron bar of considerable size but if the bar be first made elastic it will in proportion to the degree of it is elasticity require a greater degree of violence to produce the same effect thus we may easily account for an observation made by the generality of electricians viz that electricity if not unreasonbly applied never injures an healthy fiber and also why it is injurious to such as through weakness or laxity have lost the power of recovering their tone and hence we may conclude that the farther the cure of a contraction tension etc is advanced the more slow will be it is future progress and consequently that the electric force ought under such circumstances provided the patients constitution will bear it to be rather increased than diminished but as the patients sensibility always increases as the fibers become more elastic it will in many cases require a large share of resolution and perseverance to perfect the cure or even to make any considerable advances toward rendering it complete  the reason why some sprains receive much benefit from electrization and others none at all but rather injury is because some are attended with tensions others with relaxation hence a reason why the cold bath and other bracers will sometimes do much good and at other times great mischief  one evening about a year and a half ago the servant boy who then lived with me happened to sprain his wrist the cure was attempted by pumping which was continued till the wrist was greatly swelled with much inflammation and pain as soon as i was informed of the accident i caused the pumping to cease and directed the hand and wrist to be bathed in warm water after the pain and inflammation were by these means somewhat abated i electrified with sparks and shocks which soon reduced the swelling much more and the pain was now become very tolerable the next morning the warm bath and electricity were repeated and the cure perfected here indeed i lost a fine opportunity of trying the efficacy of electricity alone but i was at that time hardly got into this train of thinking it however serves to show that electricity and the warm bath belong to the same class and that they may be successfully used together  i have also known electricity fail of curing a sprain  a person wringing some clothes out of the water sprained her hand in such a manner that on the back of it there arose a small swelling the same as is usually called the springing or starting of a tendon it was soft and without pain or inflammation this was several times electrified without success but was soon after cured by the cold bath and a bandage  hence we may venture to conclude that to nervous cases in general electricity does not seem to be well adapted so far indeed as weak fibers are sometimes liable to tension as well as strong ones it will if judiciously administered be attended with great probability of success but whoever expects electricity to strengthen a weak habit will most certainly be deceived  the degree of electricity proper to be administered at a time should be determined by the degree of obstinacy in the tension contraction etc  the strength weakness or tenderness of the part affected  the age strength constitution etc of the patient considered together as in the administration of other medicines  from what has been advanced the following quaere will naturally arise  if electricity be indeed injurious to weakness or laxity how comes it to be of service in a palsy the very definition of which is a lax immobility of a muscle answ though a palsy be a lax immobility of a muscle it frequently arises from causes which astringe the nerves as colds astringent aliments or medicines ligatures etc whence the muscles become lax and collapsed and lose the power of motion from the defect of the influx of the vital spirit into them so that it is not the relaxed muscle but the astringed nerve that is the immediate object of cure or relief in a palsy because from the nerves the muscles derive their power of motion if the palsy proceed from laxity or debility of the nervous system doubtless electricity will be so far from restoring the patients strength that it will rather increase his calamity  concerning the use of electrometers and the nice distinction between metal and wooden points which at present are considered as of great importance my opinion is that they are more curious than useful i am very sensible that electricity imprudently applied may do much harm but the very severe manner in which many patients have been treated without any fatal consequence sufficiently proves that it is not necessary to dispense it like a strong chemical preparation of which half a grain too much may endanger life the case being once hit on he must be but an indifferent practitioner who cannot charge his jar within the bounds of discretion according to circumstances be the jar of whatever size it may he may take care to begin with moderation and increase till he has found the degree that will answer his intention and when he has once discovered it he may if he has any tolerable degree of judgment keep near enough to it to answer any good purpose moreover the apparatus of an electrometer wires etc added to the conductor will cause so great a waste of the electricity as to render the operation extremely tedious especially if the globe or cylinder be small and a large number of shocks are required at a time which often happens in obstinate tensions of the larger nerves or tendons add to this the disagreeable situation of the patient waiting with terror for the stroke which happens sooner or later according as the jar may acquire it is charge and that will be in proportion to the number of wires and other encumbrances and as those encumbrances are more or less loaded with dust damps etc my present method of giving the shock is this  i take the jar a pint vial in general in my right hand and a metal rod in my left and having a wire not a chain of any convenient length form the circuit by grasping one end of the wire with the rod and the other end with the jar being thus prepared i charge the jar to what height i judge proper which may be done with certainty sufficient then pressing the rod against that part of the body which occasion may require and advancing the ball of the jar to any other proper part i direct the shock at pleasure but if i suspect danger of a shock to myself from any cause that may turn the force of the electricity by way of the ground or floor as thick clothes a paralytick limb the bare earth a brick or damp floor i insulate the patient or mount the stool myself which gives perfect security sometimes i fasten one end of a chain to one part of the patient and connecting the other end with the charged vial in one hand only give the shock without fear by this means at least twothirds of the labor and wear attending the use of electrometers and wires are saved which is of no small importance to those who practice much with respect to points i could never discover but that metal points would answer every purpose for which points may be required because they may be made to operate in any degree that can possibly be procured by those made of wood and to exceed them either in mildness or sharpness they are also more certain in their operation not being liable to grow moist or dry the operator may be furnished with as many as he pleases but in this as in shocks or sparks he must be directed by the feelings of his patient on whom he may rely that he will not willingly bear enough to do himself any great harm  for a proof of the relaxing power of electricity take the account of two men killed by lightning at eastbourn in sussex sep   th    0 whose bodies after they had been dead two days were as pliable as when alive see univ mag for nov      where the same is transcribed from the philos transact vol lxxi  mr ferguson in his introduction to electricity says i have often drawn sparks from chilblains and have always found they were cured thereby i have often done the same but never found it succeed were it certain that chilblains were curable by electricity alone it might furnish an argument that would be fatal to my chief position viz that electricity is peculiarly adapted to the removal of rigidity tension etc but pernicious in cases of laxity now i presume chilblains are allowed to be the effect of blood stagnated in relaxed vessels few being subject to them except children and persons of lax habits but perhaps it may be possible to give some account for the mistake  it was that gentlemans method and a very proper one it is in all cases where an electrical operation is performed to order the electrified part to be kept very warm and this alone was sufficient for the cure of the chilblains and that in a little time too now an objection starts of it is accord  if electricity be indeed a good remedy for tensions it should according to the rule laid down by myself be a likely means of cure for the complaint of which we are speaking wherein there is a manifest tension as appears by the inflammation and hardness of the part affected  that there is such tension i readily admit yet still insist on it that electricity alone is not sufficient for the cure for unless it could strengthen the part alter the habit or remove the astringing cold along with the tension there is nothing to prevent it is immediate return whereas a good warm flannel a double pair of worsted stockings or whatever else may preserve the part in sufficient warmth will seldom or never fail of answering every purpose  electricity has been known to cure blindness and deafness but it is acknowledged that it has much more frequently disappointed the expectation this affords no argument for the uncertainty of it is effects but rather the contrary for let it be but considered that though the diseases of the eyes and ears are sometimes attended with a tension yet much the greatest part of them arise from laxity  concerning the cure of agues i must acknowledge my opinion to be at present unsettled for want of experience that such cures have been effected by electricity is affirmed by writers of credit and therefore is not to be questioned but being thoroughly persuaded that electricity operates directly contrary to such medicines as are in general esteem for the cure of agues as the peruvian bark and diverse other astringents i find it difficult to suppose how it should be attended with success unless agues may be allowed to proceed from two very different causes and indeed the body appears to be both astringed and relaxed at different periods in the same intermittent perhaps then the good effects of the electricity might be owing to a fortunate application of it in point of time what that point of time may be i cannot say but if there be any ground for the conjecture i should think it might be easily determined by one who has the advantage of frequent practice mr cavallo in his medical electricity thinks it should be a little before the fit is expected which may perhaps answer the expectation by removing the tension before it begins to show itself perhaps also it may sometimes succeed at the end of the fit when notwithstanding the apparent relaxation of the solids there may be some small remains of a tension that may give birth to another fit  early in the spring of      many persons in my neighborhood were attacked with a fever resembling a tertian which was very obstinate baffling for a long time all the endeavors of the faculty one of my family being seized with it i embraced the opportunity of trying electricity and at a time when i thought the fits were become pretty regular passed two or three very slight shocks through the sides and stomach those being the parts in which the patient complained of a troublesome pain after this the fit went off so very light that i was much pleased and began to look on electricity as a specific for an ague consequently did not fail to repeat it at the next return but how great was my disappointment when i observed that fit to be attended with symptoms more than ordinary severe i then desisted for fear of mischief for instead of believing electricity to be a specific for an ague i now began to consider it in the light of certain boasted medicines for the gout serving only to avert the paroxysm for a while which will be sure to come at last and make the greater havoc  it must be acknowledged however that this was not a perfect ague for upon a more exact observation i could plainly discern that between the paroxysms the fever did not entirely subside but the case may be offered in support of the opinion before laid down viz that electricity does not seem to be a good remedy for continual fevers and disorders where a morbid cause is supposed to lie concealed for unless it has a power of expelling the morbific matter from the blood the complaint must remain and i do not know that experience has shown it to have any such power it has indeed been found to cause a very sudden translation of pain from a limb or joint to the stomach or bowels and back again but surely such sudden translations are not always to be effected without danger especially where there is a great malignity of the humors and one fatal accident might do infinite prejudice both to the professor and his art  there have been many instances of agues cured by such accidents as have caused great surprise thus electricity may stand a good chance to succeed for it is certainly surprising enough especially to those who are unacquainted with it but curing by accident does not prove it fitted for any particular purpose were it once established in regular practice it would be a benefit to mankind but while it is used at random it cannot be deemed better than a quack medicine the effects of which whether good or bad depend on accident  if any electrification were proper in inflammatory fevers and others proceeding from a morbific cause it seems to be the simple which is equally distributed throughout the whole habit and creates the least disturbance but as the most gentle electrification will quicken the circulation and increase perspiration whether increase of circulation can be of any service at a time when the velocity of the blood is already too great or promotion of perspiration produce any great good while the blood and humors are too clammy and viscid and robbed of their fluid parts must with me remain a question till it be proved that it is also a good divider and dissolver of the viscidities and suited to bring the disease to a happy crisis or to effect a cure by expelling the latent cause at once till this be proved i must repeat it i cannot place any confidence in electricity for the cure of inflammatory fevers much less in putrid fevers where the solids have already lost too much of their cohesion  in fevers of the nervous kind there seems to be as little reason to expect relief nevertheless it often happens that in fevers merely nervous the nerves and tendons are terribly affected with tensions spasms contractions etc therefore as i before hinted concerning nervous cases in general in that respect it may prove of wonderful service provided it be used no farther than to answer the intention of removing such spasms etc and nothing more ought to be expected from it in such cases it frequently happens that the patient appears to receive surprising relief at first but on frequent repetitions finds it disagree with him but for such rigidities contractions etc as frequently remain after severe fevers inflammations rheumatisms and such like it is most certainly an admirable remedy and very little experience is sufficient to prove it  electricity has been said to cure a dropsy  without repeating what has been said concerning palsies agues etc it may be sufficient to observe  that large draughts of cold liquors taken by persons much heated with exercise are by physicians enumerated among the principal causes of a dropsy if then electricity be as is here affirmed an efficacious remedy in tensions etc it will follow that where such a cause has preceded while the disease is recent and before the waters become viscid it may prove one of the best remedies that ever was introduced into practice because as cavallo says in med elect page   it seems to act even within those parts of the body which especially when diseased are mostly out of the reach of other remedies as on the contrary when the disease arises in a languid and wornout constitution it will bid fair to hasten the patients departure  from what has been advanced it is easy to infer   st that the most immediate effect to be expected from electricity administered in the medical way is the removal of tension rigidity spasm etc   ndly that the best chance for success is when the primary cause is removed if a burning coal be laid on the hand no benefit is to be expected from electricity until the coal be taken away and then it will remove the secondary cause of the pain i e the tension nevertheless in cases where the primary cause acts with less rigor it may perhaps be of service in relieving or mitigating the pain at least from time to time until the primary cause shall cease thus in some fevers the convulsions and pain may probably be rendered tolerable while the fever is running it is course but this being conjecture only i shall not dwell on it but leave it to your consideration and experience only this i have to say that in the imperfect ague abovementioned and a few other feverish cases that have fallen within my observations it did not seem to be attended with great success   dly that in cases of laxity it is generally pernicious but under some circumstances may if managed with prudence be applied with great advantage  from whence it will follow that sometimes it ought to be accompanied with such assistants as seem best adapted to promote the intention whether astringents corroborants discutients laxitives emollients etc etc  after the strictest enquiries i have been able to make as well as from my own experience it appears to me that simple electrification drawing or throwing the stream sparks and shocks of all degrees differ only in the power and strength of their operation they all relax and render pliable and yet the milder kinds may relieve a malady which the more powerful would increase we know that mild astringents mild purgatives etc are frequently of the greatest service at times when strong ones would do great mischief not because they differ in quality but because the patients constitution cannot bear them all alike the peruvian bark given in small doses often proves a salutary bracer to the bowels but if dispensed in too large quantities has a contrary effect thus i presume it is with electricity strong shocks may by overacting their part increase a palsy they were intended to relieve suppose for instance a large nerve leading to a limb from some injurious cause to be astringed the consequence will be that the muscles of that limb will become paralytic if now that nerve can by any means be so far relaxed as to recover it is exact due tone the whole limb will be restored to health but if the nerve by a too powerful application of the very same means be over relaxed the muscles will be still paralytic in proportion to the degree of that over relaxation hence the limb may be cured or made worse by a skilful or unskilful application of the same means and thus an electric stroke may either relieve a palsy or increase it  but although the mildest operations in electricity may many times be of the greatest service yet i could wish every practitioner in this infant state of the science to be very cautious that he does not impute to the mildness of his operations the credit of cures toward which electricity never afforded the smallest assistance this is of immense importance to the practice in general for so long as men remain under mistakes or uncertainties concerning the real effects of medicines it will be impossible for them ever to arrive at any regular method of proceeding let us suppose a limb to be weakened from a luxation and to be free from tension this i trust you will grant is no wild supposition and that strong shocks are repeated to no purpose or rather to the patients prejudice suppose also that the operator perceiving this severe treatment to be more injurious than useful should omit the shocks and have recourse to sparking or drawing the stream this though a perverse treatment likewise may not be powerful enough to prevent the relaxed fibers recovering their tone by their own elastic power here kind nature performs the cure of a malady that was begun by misfortune increased by mismanagement and at last is by mistake imputed to one particular species of electricity which in truth did not in the least contribute toward it and the use of shocks is condemned as generally if not universally prejudicial only because they were injudiciously applied  although i insist so much on shocks and the frequent expediency of strong ones i do not at present make use of any thing more powerful than an apothecarys pint vial and that very seldom full charged by which you may judge that i am far enough from recommending desperate or dangerous experiments experience has however demonstrated that on proper occasions double treble and even four times that force may be advised with great safety and advantage  what alteration electricity may make in the blood and humors i do not pretend to determine that i never perceived any i can with truth declare from the surprising power it has of hastening the fluids through the orifices of the vessels and consequently of very much increasing perspiration it must i conjecture leave the blood somewhat more dry than it was before the operation but i could never observe or indeed hear of any proof of it is attenuating qualities on the solids it is influence is unquestionably very great it is most certainly a relaxer and remover of rigidity etc and frequently in a most astonishing manner i am therefore thoroughly persuaded that if medical philosophers had attended to this single circumstance it had long before this time been brought into regular practice and many miserable objects might have received the benefit of a relief which the whole faculty armed with the most powerful medicines were not able to afford  how or by what means the removal of tensions etc is performed i will not undertake to account there is no necessity to search into analyze or explain the nature of electricity perhaps it is more than the most ingenious man will ever be able to do it is sufficient for our purpose if electricity be found to produce certain regular effects and he who knows what those effects are may apply it with as much certainty and success as if he understood the whole theory of effluvia and subtle mediums and could descant in the most learned manner on the arcana of nature however from several very common experiments in electricity it appears to act by a wonderful kind of inflation which forces the particles of bodies both solid and fluid either suddenly or gradually into or toward a separation hence you may easily guess the reason why the particles of all fluids and particularly the globules of the blood are carried through tubes and vessels with an increased velocity and perhaps mr cavallo in his ingenious essay on medical electricity page    is very near the point where he says admitting dr franklins hypothesis of electricity we see that it is not the direction of the electric fluid that determines the fluids of the body one way or the other but that the effects usually observed upon the body when electrized must be owing to the irritation or dilatation occasioned by the action of that fluid  i am sir etc  finis
