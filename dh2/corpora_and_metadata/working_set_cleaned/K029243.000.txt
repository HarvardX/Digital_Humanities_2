an account of the virtues use dose and wonderful manner of operation of the pilulae polychrestae which speedily and safely extirpate those opprobrias of physicians the gout madness and melancholy of all sorts stone and gravel in the kidneys etc herein specified  printed in the year mdccxix  an account of the virtues use dose and wonderful manner of operation of the pilulae polychrestae as there seems no necessity to indicate to the reader the signs and causes of those dangerous diseases that are most certainly and safely cured by the pilulae polychrestae for non eloquentia sed remediis curantur morbi said celsus that privycouncellor to nature so we thought it better to be potent in fact than only to appear puissant in words as do the generality of our modern doctors and to relieve persons under exquisite pain than to divert our reader with conclusions drawn from topics grounded on fundamental truths or essential verities expect not therefore to meet with many profound philosophical hypothesiss or that i should prove the abstruce principles or real grounds of sympathy or concupiscible attraction and coition nor with mathematical demonstrations which i mention last because i think the least necessary in physic  it is enough at least for a time that we have made known for universal good such a polichrestick or sovereign medicine as one operating consimilar to it cannot be produced by any doctor chemist or apothecary in great britain yea and such a one as will extirpate those hydras of diseases undermentioned which have for so many ages bid defiance to the most eminent and sage physicians let not this seem a bold and emperical assertion but suspend your verdict till you have perused the following account which before we proceed to give it will be requisite to tell you that the author has used them with admirable yea almost incredible success above these thirty three years not only in this metropolis but in most parts of great britain and though he seldom administered them to any but such as were by the ablest physicians pronounced incurable and had languished under their misfortunes some three some seven some ten and some twenty years yet there were none though their cases were never so complicated or of never so long continuance but were in the space of one month at most restored by the help of these pills to a perfect state of health and though i could nominate above a hundred extraordinary and almost incredible cures performed by them to many of which some of our eminent doctors now in being are no strangers yet i decline it and refer the matter to experience which is the only true examen or lydian touchstone to distinguish truth from falsity and matter of fact from spurious and odible imposture  the virtues of these pilulae polychrestae first they cure all manias or madness in either sex but sooner in men than women by reason of the furer vterinus which is commonly either the primary or secondary cause concerning which disease and the mistaken notions both of its cause and cure i propose at a convenient time to treat   dly melancholy of all sorts whteher splenetic hypocondriac or hysteric which is commonly called vapors though of ever so long duration   dly pains in the head chiefly sympathetic that is which proceed from some indisposition of the hypochonders spleen womb etc   thly all wandering pains whether rheumatic or scorbutic in any part of the body   thly pains in the stomach whether from wind pent up in viscid slime or from some pungent acid or acrid humor pricking and lcating the vessels   thly the cholic from what cause soever   thly the stone and gravel in the kidneys   thly suppression of urine either from stones gravel sand wind or slimy matter whence stones etc are commonly generated   thly obstructions in the liver and spleen and ductus biliarius or gall passage   0thly heat and hardness of the liver which usually causes the jaundies both yellow and black and a schirrhus or stony hardness of the liver generally thought incurable and indeed if the patient has been a hard drinker and in years if likewise the distemper has been of long continuance it may be concluded so but if none of these three circumstances occur these pills have been found experimentally to restore the liver to its proper function they also perfectly cure the black and yellow jaundies    thly dropsies of all sorts whether ascites anasarcites or tympanities which is a dropsy of the womb or that disease which in outward appearance symboliseth with it the tumor of the ovarium as some doctors call it whether from wind or water or both but as the tympany of the womb always proceeds from wind it is impossible to cure it by purges the more you exhibit the worse they are neither by tapping after which i dont remember one to have lived above    days    thly the gout provided it be neither nodose nor cretaceous that is if it be accompanied with neither knots nor chalky concretions in the joints and one dose taken spring and fall perfectly prevents its returning under any form or symptom whatever in any part of the body what affinity there is between the chalky concretions lodged in the joints of gouty people and the stone generated in the kidneys shall one time or other be farther considered    thly the pleurisy and all pains in the sides or in any other part of the body whether wandering or fixed though of the longest continuance without bleeding cupping or blistering    thly the palsy whether of any particular part or member of the body or universal all over whether with a tremor or trembling or numb or dead as it is called provided they have been neither vomited purged nor clystered much less blooded blistered or cupped provided also that the patient be of a plethoric or full habit of body not thin meagre or lean old or superannuated or that the palsy has not supervened some preceding distemper as a fever etc then these pills will certainly restore the members to their pristine strength and the patient to perfect health    thly all hardness with extension or swelling of the peritonaeum and belly not only about the navel but between that and the pit of the stomach accompanied with pain and difficulty of bending the body downwards which in men has by many doctors been taken for a dropsy as they do a tympany of the womb and handled with the like success several other cases i could mention surpassing belief attended with such symptoms as the doctors could neither tell what to call nor how to manage which perhaps we may take occasion to insert in the next edition of these directions this only will i add as a general rule that in all cronic and complicated cases if the party has store of fluids these pills are never given without the desired success  i have by by this time it is supposed a little startled you by citing such a scroll or catalogue of direful diseases and the gout it self which for many ages has withstood the force of all medicines that could be opposed by the most learned academicks i say no doubt but you will wonder that they should be eradicated by a dose or two of one only medicine but we boldly and openly bid defiance to all the aesculapian tribe in great britain to produce a medicine operating like this the subsequent account of which will probably put the matter out of all dispute and to your entire satisfaction  their manner of operation and the method of ordering the patient a convenient room with a fire in it being provided and two persons to attend let the patient go into a warmed bed at eight a clock in the evening or any other time in case of necessity put at the same time a blade or two of mace and an upper crust of bread into a pint of ale and cover it up close which done give him the pills in the pulp of a roasted apple which is the best or a wafer moistened with water or canary drinking nothing either with or after them then composing himself he will presently be a sleep and continue so four hours and no longer during which time he will sweat most powerfully and care must be had neither to wipe the sweat off his face nor do any thing else to disturb him the four hours being expired and the patient awake let two people rub him dry with hot clothes and put on him a clean hot shirt and gown then bring him to the fire and let him eat a morsel of the bread and sip some of the mace ale made very hot and well sweetened with single refined loafsugar when he has done this and drank the remaining part of the ale sweating will immediately cease which is e diametro or directly contrary to all the sudorifics or sweating medicines now in use presently after they work plentifully by urine which when cold in some cases and constitutions may be cut with a knife as size to see the contents of which a clean whiteware chamber pot must be in a readiness for they cleanse the kidneys and ureters of abundance of stones sand slime etc if any be lodged there when he has been up betwixt a quarter and half an hour let him repair to bed again it being turned and well warmed or another well seasoned put in its place the sheets and blankets likewise being changed and others well heated put on then the pills begin to work strongly by breaking wind downwards to his own and the bystanders great surprise  the patient must neither eat nor drink any thing till dinner if he can fast so long if he cannot a morsel of bread and a quarter of a pint of hot ale sweetened with single refined loafsugar may be taken let his dinner be hot but neither of baked fried nor frigofyd meat his drink also must be hot and i forbid wines of all sort during the whole course of these operations and    hours after they all cease and it would be better if necessity would permit to forbear wine for    hours before the pills are taken  about two hours after dinner they begin to work downwards by stool except the patient has obstructions in the liver kidneys lacteals etc or a tympany of the womb or that distemper which the doctors call a tumor of the ovarium in all which cases and some others the working by stool is introduced by one large but easy vomit without any previous nausea or sickness which brings up none of the meat with it during the time they purge which is without any sickness or gripes the patient must by no means stop a motion or expose himself to any cold or damp air or place neither except in cases of extreme thirst which i never knew to happen must he drink any thing but if thirstiness urge a little tea made of good juniper berries and sweetened with single refined loafsugar may be drank  about an hour and half or two hours at most after supper which must be hot the patient must go to a well warmed bed and the pills taken the night before will repeat their operations successively as at first but in a much weaker degree so that sometimes there is no occasion either to rub the party or change his linen in some cases and constitutions the first dose will work   or   nights and days and the second dose   or   especially in hot weather or summer time and then there must be an intermission of   or   days before the third dose be taken but two doses commonly perform the cure be the case never so chronic and complicated in all my    years practice and upward i never knew but one patient that had occasion for the third dose whose case and many others very wonderful shall in another essay be fully related  indeed their manner of operation is so particular and extraordinary that i almost think it has scarce been paralleled in any age for though they work most powerfully by all the emunctories yet they are so gentle and agreeable to nature that she is not only exceedingly refreshed by them afterward but even pleassd with the seeming disturbance they give her hence it is no wonder that these pilulae polychrestae should extirpate so many dreadful diseases in so short a time  the dose of these pills is first four then five lastly six taken as above but if the patient labors under any acute and painful disease as the gout etc let him begin with five increasing one the next dose after the cure of any chronic distemper it is requisite to take one dose every spring and fall which must be as large as the last dose that was taken before and this will be sufficient to carry off whatever peccant matter may be collected since the last time of taking  these pills are sealed up in little thumb bottles by which means their virtues will be preserved twenty years in all regions but observe that in all hot climates the dose must be less than in england or a colder climate  sold only at mr winstones at the black boy and comb near fleet bridge in fleet street at one guinea per bottle containing three doses wo of which is commonly sufficient to cure any of the abovesaid diseases  where this book is gave away gratis to any ne that will ask for it  for the encouragement of the buyers and at they may not in the least suspect being posd upon any persons agreeing to the proposals made at the place of sale may be attended and no money received till the cure be perfected  n b no woman with child must take these pills nor any one that has an erysipelas which is the st anthonys fire elephantiasis or noli me tangere  above all things great care must be taken that no sort of liquor be drank either presently before with or after these pills even not so much as one drop to moisten the mouth or wash them down otherwise they will be of no effect  secondly observe that while the patient sweats no more clothes be put upon him than usual  lastly all the directions given in this paper are to be exactly and punctually observed if you intend to receive benefit by them or else you must blame your self and not me  finis
