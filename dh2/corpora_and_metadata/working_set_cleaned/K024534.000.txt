an inquiry into the nature cause and cure of the croup by francis home m d his majestys physician and fellow of the royal college of physicians in edinburgh  edinburgh printed for a kincaid and j bell mdcclxv  price one shilling  an inquiry into the nature cause and cure of the croup the science of medicine has been gradually advancing for these two thousand years by past and is now brought to a great degree of improvement perhaps to as great a degree every circumstance considered as the difficulty of the art the limitation of the human faculties and the continual attempts to further refinement too often conducted merely by fancy will admit of  one used to consider the progress of the different arts their gradual advancement to perfection and their subsequent decay may be apt to contemplate with some alarm the present situation of physic more attention is paid to the classing of diseases as if they were natural and permanent entities than to the complete history of each particular one more to the subdivision and splitting of them into separate species from some slight difference in the symptoms than to the general turn and complexion of the whole disease more to the novelty and change of application than to the improvement of what is already discovered and in use these a speculative mind will be apt to consider as proofs of too great refinement and distant marks of a future change  it is by a close attention to the history of particular diseases that the science has made such great advances the accuracy of ancient and modern authors has left few diseases untouched by describing every circumstance belonging to them and the appearances which occurred on inspecting the bodies after death they have ascertained most diseases and laid a foundation for arriving at as certain a knowledge of the rest as the narrow limits of our powers will allow for cases in medicine are the experiments of this branch of natural philosophy  there is one disease however which had entirely escaped all regular examination and concerning which there was little to be learned by inquiry and still less from books i mean the croup i never have seen any thing written on this subject except a thesis where the author gives us no facts and classes it amongst the spasmodic distempers to which it has no resemblance either in its progress or cure the catarrhus suffocativus of etmuller though it resembles the croup in many particulars yet appears to be a very different disease in some symptoms in the cure and appearances after deaths  dr russel in his economy of nature describes in a few lines a disease very similar to this in most of its symptoms but it seems not exactly the same as it was attended with ulcers about the larynx and terminated often in a sphacelus of the lungs besides had it been the same disease with our croup the same appearances must have occurred upon dissection to him as to us  i shall therefore treat this disease as entirely unknown as to its nature cause effects and cure and try how far our facts will carry us toward a discovery of these  how so singular and dangerous a disease has been totally neglected while such attention has been paid to most others is not the least surprising circumstance belonging to it its external features ought to have been sufficient to have roused an inquisitive searcher into diseases its internal appearances if but once seen must have raised from their singularity the strongest desire to investigate its nature but these seem to have been more than counterbalanced by its local situation the unfrequency of its appearance the subjects which it attacked these being generally children and unable to give a distinct account of their complaints the rapidity of its course the apparent easiness of its symptoms and their similitude to other catarrhal or peripneumoniac distempers these seem to be sufficient reasons for its being so long undistinguished and undescribed without laying us under any necessity of looking on it as a new disease probably it has existed more or less in all ages for the same productive causes must have operated formerly as they do at present  this disease happens or at least is observed so seldom in this city that very few cases must occur to any particular person during the course of a whole lifetime to have the power of seeing more one must put himself in the way of intelligence especially at places situated on the coast by that means i have had an opportunity of attending more cases than otherwise would have fallen to the share of any one the danger of the symptoms under such apparent ease and the singularity of its appearances after death in the first examination excited my curiosity the subsequent cases were sufficient to show me its nature though perhaps not to point out a certain cure that is not always allowed to mortals to be able however to distinguish it from other diseases to discover the nature of it to point out when it is cureable and when not perhaps to lay a foundation for improvement in its most desperate state that is the design of the following pages  to be the first author in treating a disease to have no assistance from preceding experience is a situation a little uncommon in these modern times to this cause and to the rarity of the disease must be imputed my not bringing it to that degree of improvement that i could wish and that has happened in other diseases if this can serve for a foundation to excite others to inquire to preserve and to communicate facts observed by them my labor will be well bestowed  this disease appears to belong peculiarly to children and the younger they are after they are weaned the more liable they seem to it on the breast they appear less subject to it or which is as probable as they cannot tell their complaints it is taken for some other disease i never saw or heard of one above twelve years of age affected by it after this the body gains a strength capable of resisting the cause or of expelling it when received about this time or a little after very great changes happen in the human frame  it seems likewise in a great measure to have a local situation and to be very seldom found at any great distance from the seashore it appears much less in edinburgh than in leith or musselburgh it is often seen along the coast of fife and is very common i am told along the coast of airshire and galloway though i never heard of it in the neighboring coast of england yet probably it is to be found there too the same causes that kept it from being so long attended to here may still make it neglected there very wet and marshy situations sometimes produce it  in the first history of a disease it becomes absolutely necessary to set down the cases and the facts as they really happened in diseases that have already been described it is sufficient to enumerate the symptoms as they generally appeared by which the difference betwixt that species and any of the former may be observed but in a new disease as little ought to be left to the fancy or judgment of the historian as possible for from the natural appearance of the symptoms all our reasoning and conclusions must take their rise as cases are analogous to the experiments of natural philosophy they ought to be described as circumstantially hipporates that great historian of diseases treats his epidemics as they were new distempers in this way  case i march   th was called to miss aged fifteen months of an inflammatory constitution and living within a quarter of a mile of the seashore the day before she had appeared duller and hotter than usual this morning she was attacked with a difficulty of breathing her pulse was strong and about     in a minute five ounces of blood was immediately taken from her after which she was seized with the sharp stridolous voice which i can resemble to nothing more nearly than the crowing of a cock and which is the true diagnostic sign of this disease she had a quick and high breathing and unusual heat in her forehead and palms of her hands her feet and hands were swelled and had an aedematous appearance as her pulse was still strong five ounces of blood was again taken from her which seemed to ease her greatly the steams of warm water and vinegar made her spit up and did her service her belly was kept constantly loose with magnesia alba and that night a blister was applied round her neck on the third day she was a little easier but the voice still remained shrill the breathing high and pulse strong at night four leeches were applied to her throat and the orifices constantly fomented with warm water continued blooding for four hours next morning all the symptoms went off in this case the repeated bloodings especially the local one with internal and external fomentation did most remarkable service i was not so certain about the effects of the blister  case ii miss  aged eighteen months healthful living near a great loch and about a mile distant from the sea was seized march  0th with the croup she had immediately lost five ounces of blood by leeches and had got a vomit next morning she had taken a second vomit after which i first saw her her voice had the characteristical shrillness only when she raised it or coughed her breathing was quick pulse about   0 and rather weak dry rough short cough she had no pain in swallowing but showed uneasiness when she turned about her head urine clear and without sediment the steams of warm water and vinegar and a blister round the neck were ordered in the evening she was better and her lungs appeared somewhat moister that night she rested pretty well and on the third day her voice was natural except when she coughed she had a running at the nose and there was a cloud in the urine the vomit repeated on the fourth day the voice was still somewhat unnatural the urine now deposited a light sediment which lasted for three or four days during which she gradually recovered she had the same disease again six months after but in a slighter manner  case iii a child two years old who had had the small pox six weeks before had been seized august  th with the croupy voice leeches had been applied and blisters behind the ears and to the throat on the   th i saw him and sound his breathing bad great stuffing shrill voice and a swelling externally on the superior part of the trachea pulse   0 every thing looked ill steams external fomentation poultices and several leeches were applied to the throat   th the child greatly relieved more cheerful and voice more natural   th pulse much better and the peculiarity of voice and the swelling almost gone  i need not relate more cases of this kind as such like commonly occur and as they are sufficient to prove its nature in this situation the only remark that i shall make is that the symptoms of these three patients and their cure show plainly the croup in this state to be a disease of an inflammatory nature attacking the organs of voice and respiration particularly the superior parts of the trachea and that the local inflammation often ends by resolution this disease appears to be confined chiefly to the trachea as the patients have no pain in deglutition as they generally complain when they are of an age to speak of a dull pain in the upper part of it as sometimes an external swelling is seen there and as the fauces are at most but a little redder  let us now see what light other situations of the disease and inspection into the morbid body will give us  case iv september   th    0 was called to a boy of seven years of age who had been some days sick he lived on leith bridge had been ill of the chincough the preceding winter and had recovered of the measles about six weeks before this he had been frequently purged and had been tolerably well excepting a slight cough till he was seized four days before i saw him with fever heat thirst and the shrill croupy voice when i saw him his pulse was quick with a little degree of hardness but not strong he swallowed easily but complained of a pain in the trachea when he spoke or when i pressed it with my fingers his face had been swelled great drought breathing high but not very quick he sometimes expectorated and had often frothy saliva upon his lips the urine had a white ouzy sediment his senses and his head were quite clear and distinct he was immediately blooded and at night had leeches applied to his throat and a blister round it the next day his pulse was weaker and beat     in a minute breathing quicker and often altered distinct in all his senses died that night  on laying open the parts there was no appearance of any inflammation on the fauces but to my great surprise the whole superior internal surface of the trachea was covered with a white soft thick preternatural coat or membrane easily separable from it and generally lying loose upon it and purulent matter lodged below and around it the subjacent parts were red but no great degree of inflammation as we searched downwards the same appearances continued through the ramifications of the aspera arteria though the membrane seemed here softer thinder and to become of a more purulent nature all the branches of the windpipe and bronchiae were filled with purulent matter and we could easily squeeze it out in great plenty from all these pipes the substance of the lungs was quite sound and in a natural state  these circumstances appeared at that time so new and surprising to me that i looked on them as accidental and not the natural effects of the disease but i was soon convinced of the contrary  case v october  th i was calledto the last boys sister aged five years who had been observed only the day before to complain of a dull pain in the throat she had been immediately blooded and had got a mixture of spt minder and theriac with a blister to the neck she had been in a constant sweat since she began to take the mixture when i saw her she had the dry shrill voice and difficult breathing with great motion of the ribs and scapulae her face was a little swelled and red deglutition easy her pulse was quick and of a proper degree of strength what she expectorated seemed to be of a purulent nature her senses were all in the natural state leeches were immediately applied to her neck and afterward a warm fomentation and the steams of warm water and vinegar these appeared to give her some ease at night she seemed worse and could not ly long in one posture she was vomited with the sir scillit and threw up a great deal of gross ropy defluxion i tried her with a mixture of camphire and nitre the next day her pulse was     and weaker the amygdalae appeared a little swelled and covered with mucus she had a little difficulty of deglutition frequent reachings she called often for drink but drunk little at a time tongue white and furred breathing rather quicker today and often altered eat some spoonfuls of panada and wine she was ordered an emollient injection and garlic cataplasms to her feet in the afternoon all the symptoms were worse the injection had operated thrice breathing difficult and quicker great restlessness and anxiety pulse weaker and intermitted she died in the evening all her senses being distinct and having eat somewhat just before what she spit up appeared thin but what came up with the short stiffled cough was always thick and yellow like matter  when she was opened by mr gibson surgeon we perceived the glands at the root of the tongue turgid covered with mucus and their excretories open the amygdalae were larger than usual but neither they nor the neighboring parts were inflamed all about the glottis was covered with a tough viscid mucus when the trachea was opened no inflammation appeared but all its superior internal surface particularly the back part next the oesophagus was covered with a soft halfdissolvedlikemembrahe detached from the subjacent parts lying loose like the blankets of a bed that has been lain in and matter like pus on each side of it and betwixt it and the membrane of the trachea some of the small glands about the glottis were turgid the farther down we searched the more purulent matter we found but no membrane appeared here when we came to where the trachea enters the lungs by squeezing them we could force out through it a great deal of whitish glutinous liquid the same matter appeared in all the ramifications of the lungs and they seemed to be entirely full of it as we could squeeze it our mixed with a little blood from the smallest divisions of that canal the substance of the lungs appeared quite sound the internal coat of the stomach seemed likewise very soft and covered with a great quantity of mucus  case vi juanuary  d i was called to a boy of seven years of age at musselburgh who had gone about till this morning but had complained for four days of a great difficulty in his breathing and of a constant dull pain about the head of the trachea attended with a shrill voice as his pulse was quick and his breathing difficult the surgeon had that morning taken twelve ounces of blood from him and given him gum ammon sal c c gr iv when i saw him at night his pulse was very frequent and weak his breathing quick still a little pain about the head of the trachea no inflammation to be seen in the fauces and his urine deposited an ouzy sediment his voice was feeble and the shrillness had gone off as i saw he would soon die i desired the surgeon to open him and to be particularly attentive to every circumstance in the whole course of the trachea as some unusual appearances there had occurred to me in this disease  he told me afterward that the lungs were not in the least inflamed that he found a little below the aperture of the glotttis a quantity of what appeared to him pure matter but had not observed whether or not there was any membrane nor whether the ramifications of the trachea were filled with the matter this however must certainly have been the case as matter was actually found in the superior parts of the trachea as his lungs appeared otherwise sound and could not be the cause of his death and as he had the same purulent sediment in his urine which i had observed in the former cases and which attends all collections of matter in whatever part of the body they are contained to our purpose it is sufficient that matter of a purulent kind was found in the trachea  case vii a bookbinders child four years old in this town was seized with a cough and quick breathing saturday october  th      as it appeared of the croupy kind he was blooded with leeches that day and blistered next day after this he seemed better and went coughing through the house that week sunday   th i first saw the child the voice was rather more hoarse than usual in the croup the pulse very quick and the breathing very laborious with a little pain in the throat in swallowing dry short cough i suspected that there was a considerable mixture of the angina with the croup here leeches were applied to the neck with fomentation and steams   th breathing much better and all the symptoms easier   th all the symptoms worse pulse and breathing very quick died the   th  the trachea when opened by mr wood surgeon was covered for half an inch from the glottis downwards with a firm white thick membrane from which for an inch further down was a soft yellowish purulentlike matter not yet hardened all the membranes of the trachea were entire under these but much inflamed and red in some parts of the lungs the vesicles contained the same kind of matter but in no great quantity  case viii october  0th      a girl aged four years coughed a little was out the day following and at night the cough increased with hoarseness on the   d mr wood the familysurgeon by accident saw her playing and observing her breathing laborious and her pulse quick though she was otherwise well he blooded her   d she was worse and had a blister applied to her throat and back and got an injection   th i saw her first her breathing quick and hoarse pulse   0 urine with an ouzy sediment and was told that she had coughed up what seemed to the family pure matter by her breathing more of the same kind still seemed to be left behind she eat and drank without any pain to expel the matter if possible she got a vomit of squills but nothing came away   th she was much in the same way and i observed some matter mixed with the saliva that she had coughed up breathing exceeding quick and laborious ordered the steams of warm vinegar to be drawn into the lungs on purpose to produce a fit of coughing but it had no such effect and she died in the evening  when the trachea was opened by mr wood the whole internal surface was covered with a membrane for three inches downwards from the glottis this membrane was complete all around did not adhere to the trachea and came off in the shape of a hollow tube the natural coats of the trachea seemed entire and not ulcered the substance of the lungs was quite sound but the vesicles of the left lobe were filled with yellow thick pus which sunk in water the new formed membrane had some degree of tenacity and when steeped in milkwarm water for two days did not dissolve but preserved some degree of cohesion mo fibers could be observed in it  the preceding facts excited the curiosity of some gentlemen and have been confirmed from similar observations made by them and which they lately transmitted to my hands  case ix mr wardrobe surgeon related to me the the following case a boy eight years of age and healthful had been ill two days his breathing was difficult his voice was croupy he was feverish and had all the other symptoms of the disease he was blooded blistered etc but all to no purpose and died the fourth day  the whole trachea externally appeared swelled and rather oedematous than inflammatory when he opened it the whole inside was covered with a soft thick palecoloured membrane which easily separated from the parts below those had a slight degree of inflammation when he pursued the ramifications of the trachea through the lungs there was found there a considerable quantity of real pus which seemed to fill all those pipes the lungs themselves were sound nothing can be liker the former cases than this and as mr wardrobe had no occasion of ever seeing it again he had concluded as i had done before in similar circumstances that it was an anomalous case it now appears to be the common course of nature in that disease when mortal  case x the following case in confirmation of the preceding was communicated to me by mr balfour surgeon and which i shall deliver in his own words november  st      i was desired to visit a child between two and three years old living at the canonmills his face was flushed his breathing laborious his cough of the hard croupy kind his pulse was frequent his tongue clean with little drought and no pain i was informed by the parents that the child had been very healthful but for eight days past had been troubled with a cough which did not put on the present appearance till the night before i was called and that the child had till that time gone about and eat his meat heartily they had then applied leeches to his neck which bled a great deal and had with difficulty been stopped i immediately took away from the jugular vein two cupfulls of blood more which was sizy and being informed that he sometimes reached i ordered a vomit of tinct ipecacuanh with an addition of acet scillit which was given about an hour after he was blooded and brought up a great deal of tenacious mucus that night he got a blister to his back and the saline mixture every two hours nov  d his pulse was as frequent but not so firm all the other symptoms rather worse he was ordered a decoction of the bark the oily saline mixture to be taken internally and the camphorated volatile oil to be applied externally the child took two or three doses of the decoction and mixture but toward the evening the symptoms growing worse the medicines were discontinued the child died next morning  when the trachea was laid open i thought that a suppuration had happened but upon nearer inspection found that it was only the mucus which had acquired a purulent color and that it was formed into a membranous crust which every where lined the internal membrane of the trachea from the larynx to its entrance into the thorax this preternatural membrane appeared thickest about the middle of the trachea and there seemed almost to fill up the passage it was so firm that a considerable portion separateed at once leaving the natural membrane of the trachea bare and sound and with the appearance of a slight inflammation i put a considerable portion of the preternatural membrane into water and after that it still retained a degree of tenacity but had too little firmness to be preserved  case xi mr wood surgeon gave me the following a child about sixteen months old was seized with the croup and died the seventh day on opening the body there was found in the lower part of the larynx and beginning of the trachea a substance of a membranous appearance adhering slightly around the inside of these parts when it was removed the membranes of the trachea were found entire and somewhat redder than usual along the trachea and bronchial branches there was a considerable quantity of mucus it was frothy and somewhat tenacious this mucus extended as far as the membranous appearance and downwards into the minutest branches of the bronchiae in which it had a yellowish purulent appearance the surface of the lungs was somewhat reddish  case xii the following case which was communicated to me by  i think worth relating as it shows the disease in a different situation from all the preceding indeed under such circumstances as i never had an opportunity to see and must appear very seldom in for it is the only one of its kind that i have heard of  miss  about nine years old was seized with a slight cough on the   th of october owing to rainy weather and wet feet on the   th when i saw her first the scarcely had any heat thirst or sickness and no pain of any kind except when she coughed or was fretted which bringing on a quick inspiration she then felt some slight pain in the windpipe a little below the rima glottidis her voice was shrill like that of a young cock she was blooded got a gentle vomit emolient cataplasms to her feet and a blister to her back   th symptoms no better no difficulty of deglutition and no redness to be seen in the throat she never expectorated any thing like pus or phlegm during the whole course of the disease steams of warm water were tried   th her cough was incessant for some hours during which she coughed up a piece of a membrane this i believed to be a part of what lines the trachea as it had a mortified appearance and was like black shagg silk she died soon after this  upon opening the body the disease seemed seated solely in the head of the trachea as its membrane appeared to me mortified two inches downwards below that the trachea and its branches seemed quite sound  it was very natural for one who had never any opportunity of seeing this disease in its natural situation to think that a mortification had seized on the coats of the trachea but to one who has been accustomed to inspect bodies in this disease it must appear probable that it was only the preternatural and morbid membrane become black which gave the trachea the appearance of being mortified no wonder that the coats of the trachea were thought to be in a gangrenous state when i imagined they had suppurated in the first case that i met with the coughing up a piece of the membrane shows that it was this loosely adhering one and none of the natural ones which are so firmly attached and which having no fleshy parts below could not have been so easily separated this then appears to differ in no other point from the others but only that here the morbid membrane had dried and turned black whereas in all the former it was moist and white  these are all the cases that i have kept an account of or received from others though few they are leading ones and sufficient to establish many material facts and circumstances that have hitherto been unknown with regard to this disease we will now draw from them some conclusions which as we have proceeded so cautiously will be the more certain if we add any reasoning to set these conclusions in a clearer light we shall keep as close as possible to settled experiment and shall give it only as probable conjecture finding fault with no person who may reason differently  corollary i it seems easy in general to distinguish the croup from all other diseases hitherto described a peculiar sharp shrill voice not easily described a remarkable freedom from all complaints when in imminent danger so that they will eat a minute before they expire a quick laborious breathing a frequent pulse sometimes strong at first but always soft and weak toward the end scarce any difficulty of deglutition or remarkable inflammation in the fauces a dull pain often and sometimes an external swelling in the upper part of the trachea senses quite distinct to the last and all the symptoms most rapid in their progress characterise sufficiently this disease i have not mentioned a cough as that symptom is sometimes absent and when it attends the croup it is not of the common kind but more short and stiffled and less convulsive with little or no expectoration  the other symptoms that often attend it such as a red swelled face oedematous feet drought urine sometimes with and at other times without a sediment reachings etc are not so constant as the former and therefore are not so characteristical  those not conversant in this disease often mistake peripneumoniacal complaints and severe colds for it and as they frequently cure these they are apt to look on it as not so dangerous but we have seen that the lungs are totally free from any inflammation and are not the seat of the disease the catarrhus suffocativus of etmuller seems likewise to have been a peripneumony and as he describes no peculiarity in the voice as the symptoms seem to have been apparently severer and as it returned at stated and regular periods we must consider them as different diseases though similar in many points  as this disease has different vulgar names for i am told that on the west coast they call it the chock or stuffing a technical one becomes absolutely necessary a name is best given from the apparent symptoms which are always conspicuous while the cause is generally hidden and often doubtful the leading symptoms here are the shrill voice and difficult breathing it therefore may properly be called suffocatio stridula  corol ii as it appears peculiar to a certain age and local in a great measure as to its situation so it seems to attend certain seasons of the year all the preceding cases showed themselves during the course of the winter from the month of october to the month of march except one in august which was probably owing to the antecedent smallpox for long catarrhs from the small pox measles or chincough are strong predisponent causes to this disease the moist and cold weather in winter seems to have great power in producing this disease  corol iii very different have been the opinions with regard to the seat of the suffocatio stridula some placing it in the glottis and its muscles some in the coats of the trachea while others have fixed its seat in the lungs themselves none of all these opinions appear to be true the glottis is never found contracted or inflamed the lungs are quite sound and the coats of the tracked seem to suffer only by second hand  the seat of this distemper appears to be the cavity of the windpipe the place first and most particularly affected is the upper part of the trachea about an inch below the glottis for in that part they complain of a dull pain the external swelling has been observed there and the morbid membrane we have found stretching from that place downwards the back part of the trachea where there are no cartilages seems from the inspection spection of those that die of this disease to be its first and principal seat as this morbid membrane is often found there when it is in no other part  no wonder that the morbid appearances are chiefly found there for there are lodged the greatest number of glands designed for the secretion of mucus this fluid is separated from glandular bodies deposited betwixt the different membranes which are perforated by an infinite number of almost imperceptible small holes that give a passage to the excretory ducts of these glands the largest of these lie on the outer and posterior surface of that membrane which serves on the back part to make up the deficiency of the cartilages as they are not complete circles  in some of the former cases the whole glands at the root of the tongue and the amygdalae were turgid and the parts covered with mucus in the mucous glands in general this distemper ought to be considered as originally seated but from particular causes more directed to those of the trachea where from the nature of the part it becomes visible in a different shape  corol iv various have been the theoretical opinions of people who never had the opportunity or gave themselves the trouble to search into the real cause of this distemper some have attributed it to spasms of the muscles that contract the glottis that it was not occasioned by spasms of the muscles that contract the larynx might have appeared from the symptoms themselves had this been of the class of spasmodic nervous diseases it would have come in paroxysms with remission and exacerbation the urine would always have been pale convulsions would have come on before death and antispasmodics instead of evacuants would have been the remedies  had these muscles or any of the coats of the trachea been inflamed or mortified as others have thought the pain would have been greater than it is before the mortification and the pulse would have been stronger than it generally is as the parts are membranous  if according to the opinion of many the lungs had been inflamed and suppurated the cough would have been more incessant and violent the pulse full and soft with a sensation of weight in the breast sizy blood dry tongue and delirium  but all these fanciful erroneous opinions fall to the ground when we once inspect the morbid body from that true source of knowledge we learn that the cause of this disease is a preternatural white tough thick membranous crust covering often for many inches the inside of the trachea this membrane is of so tenacious a consistence that it can remain soaking in warm water for many days without dissolving it is not attached to the parts below but is easily separable from them as there is always matter behind it when it ends the trachea is covered with good pus or purulent mucus as are generally the ramifications of the bronchiae and vesicles which in some cases were quite filled with it to account how this matter as there is no ulceration and how this membrane are formed we must trace things from their source  the blood consists of three principal parts the crassamentum serum and lymph the last of which is a diaphanous liquor full of gelatinous and nutritious particles this liquor very similar to the white of an egg is coagulable by heat alkohol acids and by every method which attracts or evaporates the watery particles this coagulable part probably is the nutritious part of our blood  this gelatinous lymph abounds more in young animals than in those come to maturity geoffroy le cadet in the mem acad des sciences for the year    0 by many experiments shows us this fact and makes it appear that there is twice as much nutritive jelly in veal as in beef the final reason for this is selfevident for young creatures on account of their growing require a greater supply of nourishment children must therefore abound more with it than men  the mucus separated from glands in different parts of the body viz nose fauces oesophagus stomach guts trachea and bronchiae appears to be very analogous to this lymph the former differs from the latter only in its greater spissitude and this alteration is brought about after its secretion the more watery parts being volatilized and dissipated while the more heavy and viscous remain behind this mucus is extremely disposed to inspissation as appears from experiments even the admission of cold air into the trachea thickens this mucus often to such a degree that it stagnates in the glands and all secretion is entirely stopped  in children as well as in old people this secretion is plentiful owing to the great quantity of it they contain and to the laxity of their vessels this evacuation is particularly increased during the cold and moist weather of winter when the perspiration is diminished and the glandular secretions increased  this evacuation is promoted by all stimulants operating on the trachea and lungs as we observe from the effects of snuff and the smoke of tobacco the maritime air supplies a stimulus calculated to increase the secretion from the mucus glands of the trachea and lungs along with the moisture sweeped from the sea by the winds is carried likewise a great quantity of sea salt as every thing at some distance from the shore tastes salt this inspired into the lungs stimulates the orifices of the tracheal glands and increases the mucous secretion this effect will happen more particularly in children as their nerves are more irritable than those of people advanced in years hence we find that in moist winter weather particularly along the seashore children should have an unusual secretion of mucus from the glands of the windpipe diseases such as the smallpox measles chincough etc and other natural causes have the same effect in increasing this discharge when these are combined there exists the greatest predisposition to this disease  when there happens a very great secretion of this coagulate fluid from the glands of the trachea in children they are either not sufficiently attentive or often too young to spit it up the thinner parts are carried off during expiration while the remainder is thickened and compressed by the obstruction that the narrowness of the glottis must make to the exit of the air from a larger canal every circumstance encourages its concretion into a solid firm membrane while the more internal parts of the mucus continuing still fluid and the continual secretion of more keep it separated from the parts below  but how happens it that we find pure matter which sinks in water behind the membrane and in the different ramifications of the trachea when there is no ulceration matter does not seem to be formed as was generally thought by the vessels of the ulcer but to exist in the blood particularly in the serous and lymphatic liquors nearly in the fame state and to be probably the true nutrititious nay perhaps the coagulable part of our fluids dr pringle in his ingenious useful and accurate experiments upon septic and antiseptic substances found that the serum when stagnating and exposed to heat let fall a white substance like pus and from thence justly concludes that the pus of ulcers is formed in the same way by the evaporation of the more watery particles and the subsiding and inspissation of this part this fluid shows a great tendency to become solid by restoring quickly all loss of substance  there cannot be a fitter situation for the formation of pus from the mucous secretion than the trachea and lungs there the same secretion evaporation stagnation and heat exists as in an ulcer and therefore the same consequence should and does happen we often see real pus spit up in the end of a cold perhaps this change from mucus to pus happens before the membrane is formed as pus shows such a tendency to assume a solid form and is designed by nature to repair all deficiencies in the solids  this disease now appears of a very singular nature and unlike any other that we know du haen has indeed lately told us that he has sometimes found in dissection the viscera covered externally with a white tough crust i wish he had given us the history of some of these patients he imagines that it was formed from the inflammatory crust in the blood but here these never is found any  i have lately met with a description in the philosophical transactions abridged vol  d page   th of a membrane formed in the inside of the trachea a boy five years old died of a consumption a year before his death he was troubled with a dry cough which continued ever after spitting now and then a little quantity of blood ten or twelve days before he died his nurse took notice of some thick skins he spit up his physcian having examined one of them sound it had the shape and consistence of a vessel which made him think it might perhaps be some vessel of the lungs the child being dead i opened the body in the left side of the lungs i found a little purulent sanies the inside of the trachea was incrustated with a slimy membrane which i took off from the trachea and the branches in the lungs insomuch that that pellicula made a perfect vessel from the larynx to the very extremities of the bronchiae from which it came off very easily without breaking either the trunk or the branches it adhered to the inward coat of the trachea only by some small filaments which were so tender that they broke off easily and made me think the production of that extraordinary vessel was nothing but the mucilaginous humor continually discharged by the glands of the trachea grown more clammy by the distemper and so dry that it could not be spit out this incrusting the inside of the trachea and bronchiae and growing thicker was at last shaven off by the violent fit of coughing the child was sometimes taken with and then was renewed again by the succeeding mucus this new vessel would not dissolve in hot water the vessels of the lungs that is the trachea and bronchiae the pulmonary arteries and veins were as whole as could be  it appears by the dissection that there was no imposthume formed in the lungs and that the child died from this preternatural membrane perhaps many of the polypuss thrown up from the bronchial vessels of grown up people might have the same origin these cases show how apt the mucus is to acquire a solid form  we have an account in the philosophical transactions abridged vol  d of a disease in cornwall called the morbus strangulatorius which from the pustles petechiae and putrid disposition of the fluids appears more nearly allied to the malignant sore throat although it sometimes attacked the aspera arteria a case is there related where a hollow membranous coat of the shape of the trachea and its branches was coughed up and supposed to be the natural membrane of these parts another similar to the former came up afterward the patient lived about a day after this  corol v there appears from the preceding facts two very different situations of the suffocatio stridula the former more inflammatory and less dangerous the latter less inflammatory and highly dangerous in the former the pulse is generally strong the face red drought great and they agree with evacuations in the latter the pulse is very quick and soft great weakness tongue moist less drought great anxiety and evacuations hasten death the former may be called the inflammatory and the latter the purulent state  these are two very different stages of the distemper and must be carefully distinguished by the practitioner that he may know how to direct his applications or at least how to form a just prognosis as he is generally not called till the patient is in the latter stage if this disease comes on with an old habitual cough or by slow degrees the inflammatory stage will scarcely be perceivable  if the pulse is very soft and feeble especially after being strong or any purulent matter comes up with spitting vomiting or coughing which happened in some of the former cases we have a proof that the purulent state is already formed experience has taught me another mark by which i can distinguish these different states i have observed that the urine which during the inflammatory state is thin had always after the purulent state came on a light ouzy purulent sediment such as people have from matter collected any where that has no vent outward  no wonder that the matter is speedily absorbed in this situation as it is contained in the bronchiae and vesicles and of course imbibed by the whole internal surface of the lungs and trachea a surface infinitely greater than any imposthume can have hence the blood will be suddenly filled with it and the urine have that white purulent sediment which arises from absorption of matter  in the latter stage we find the membrane completely formed is it so in the former i suspect that it has not yet got a firm consistency otherwise evacuations would not have so sudden and salutary an effect as they produce in this stage perhaps the turgid and inflamed glands are but yet expelling the thick mucus which is circulating through the vessels in too great a quantity and in too inspissated a state this is strongly confirmed by the great quantity of mucus sound in the stomach and the swelling of the mucous glands at the root of the tongue even after death we perceive some degree of inflammation in the coais of the trachea which probably has been greater at the beginning when the flux of humor commeneed and the irritation was stronger  corol vi it seems to be no very difficult matter to account from the cause for all the symptoms of this disease a straitening of the trachea and dryness of the parts will mechanically alter the voice and make it more shrill for we find in all wind instruments the notes are acute in proportion to the smallness of the bore mr balfour surgeon told me that he attended a child in a disease which from the similarity of voice appeared to him the croup the child died when opened a piece of shell which the child had sucked in with it is breath was lying across the trachea about an inch below the glottis and the membrane was inflamed and dry here was an artificial croup raised from which we may evidently perceive how the voice is altered in the natural disease  when there appears to be a great quantity of mucus circulating in the vessels when there is often so much mucus or pus in all the pipes of the lungs when there is a preternatural membrane formed in the trachea no wonder that nature excites a fever her general and constant resource when she is violently attacked and in danger  considering the acuteness of the fever considering the obstruction in the trachea bronchiae and vesicles with what difficulty the air must gain admission to distend them and what hindrance that must give the blood circulating through the lungs a laborious breathing must necessarily attend the other symptoms  as the blood passes with some difficulty through the lungs an unusual weakness must certainly come on the face become swelled and the extremities appear oedematous  to account for that total want of pain or so slight a one that they dont attend to it unless when asked is a matter of some difficulty that the membrane of the windpipe in general so very irritable from every slight cause should calmly bear the presence of such a quantity of matter and of so thick a membrane is not the least surprising circumstance of this uncommon distemper the mucus being a humor natural to these parts its slow and gradual collection and inspissation fresh mucus constantly separated which hinder the membrane from hurting the trachea unless in motions of the neck these reasons may account in part for the diminution of that natural irritability which resides in these places but they do not satisfy me altogether we cannot expect to have all our doubts removed  corol vii this disease appears in general to be a very dangerous one and the more so as it is silent in its progress and gives no visible alarm till death is near at hand the first stage of this distemper often passes unobserved and before we see it is beyond all remedy as it happens frequently to young children who are unable to speak or describe their feelings we have double reason to be afraid  if we be not called till the third or fourth day if the breathing appears much affected the pulse quick and weak the face red great anxety and frequent tossing the danger is great and pressing but if we see the patient the first or second day of the attack if the breathing is not very bad the pulse though frequent strong and firm and more especially if the voice is only altered in its stronger exertions of crying or coughing but more natural in its common state we may entertain hopes of a recovery the first sign commonly of safety is the cough becoming stronger and less dry with that peculiar sound which attends moistened lungs for this shows that the membrane is not formed or is already dissolved and that the inflammatory state is abated  the case seems very desperate when the membrane is once formed and the lungs filled with matter in the latter case the patient is soon suffocated as effectually though more slowly as if he was immersed over the head in it  it appears from the preceding cases that the membrane alone is sufficient to kill as there was but little matter found in the lungs of some of them  desperate as the case is the patients recovery is perhaps not altogether impossible nature by the means of a critical cough may eject the membrane and matter though indeed the sensation of these parts by which it must effectuate this seems almost altogether destroyed if that happened the patient would recover as the lungs are quite sound  in one of the former cases part of the membrane was thrown up but the patient died i was told by mr gibson surgeon that a patient of his escaped after throwing up a great quantity of matter and coughing up large pieces of a membrane  the following curious case was communicated to me lately by mr rae surgeon a boy betwixt five and six years of age was seized august  th      with a slight cold and hoarseness on the  th had a difficulty of breathing the shrill voice and a little fever as the boy was in a natural sweat he ordered a mixture with spt minder  th pulse quicker and no expectoration was blooded got an injection and had a blister applied to his throat   th this morning he was told that after a severe fit of coughing a membranelike substance about two inches long pretty tough and resembling a piece of thin white leather had been thrown out in the evening some pus was observable in the phlegm expectorated up and easily distinguishable from it the boy did not recover his voice for three months  art though not in the way of internal medicine may attempt effectuating the same end  corol viii we have had occasion to see in the preceding cases great variety of different applications and their good or bad success let us deduce some general rules with regard to practice in the inflammatory state bleeding appears to have been attended with immediate good effects and to be a powerful remedy in this situation this ought to be done expeditiously and plentifully while the pulse will allow it it is best to take blood at first with the lancet so that a sufficient quantity may soon b drawn off and afterward by leeches applied to the upper and fore part of the throat their orifices when kept open by the application of warm wetcloths will allow the blood to onze from them for many hours  it seems necessary to keep the patients belly constantly loose by such medicines as children will take for we ought to be very attentive not to set them acrying as that may suddenly suffocate the child for this purpose i generally use tablets of magnesia alba made palatable with sugar some of the cooling resolvent salts such as the chrystalised sal polychrest dissolved in whey will be of service provided the patient will peaceably take them  blisters applied round the neck after the vessels are well emptied do great service they seem to do none when applied before this time nay if the state is very inflammatory must do much hurt from their violent stimulus on the vessels emollient fomentations and cataplasms applied round the neck are of considerable use and keep up a local evacuation  these evacuations operate in several different ways viz by thinning the dense mucus while yet circulating in the blood by diverting its flux from the parts affected as there is a great communication and consent betwixt the different mucous glands through the body but particularly by increasing the absorbent power of the vessels on emptying them by which means the purulent matter will be sucked in from the lungs it was found in the urine of one of the foregoing convalescent patients  the resolvent and gently stimulating steams of warm water and vinegar drawn in with the breath seemed always to have an immediate good effect is it from dissolving the thick mucus and so opposing its concretion that is probably the case as the patient always spits a great deal after it and the lungs appear moister  vomits are frequently given in this stage of the disease they are generally thought to be of use but i never saw any advantage arising from them i rather suspect that they must be often pernicious as they increase the secretion of mucus in the lungs without expelling it which is the very circumstance that if possible we ought to guard against the evacuation that they make otherways is but small  gentle sudorifics may be of service as they divert the flux from the more internal parts to the external others think that these are of use and prescribe the vin emet in small quantities i cannot say that i ever saw any great advantage from them  but when the membrane is once formed or the purulent matter in great quantity collected in the lungs evacuations can be no longer of any use they rather hurt as the pulse is then weak hence the reason why people differ about the effects of evacuations in this disease some deeming them the only certain remedy while others hold them to be destructive both have built their opinion on fats and observation but as their applications were made in different stages of the distemper the effects behoved to be different what was the only remedy in the inflammatory state must appear hurtful in the purulent  in this state of purulency we plainly see that nothing can do service but what brings up the matter from the lungs and that speedily too and pray what medicines can do this vomits only evacuate immediately the stomach but by means of the sympathy of the nerves they often bring on a coughing during their action they might be of service if they had this salutary effect but i never saw them answer this purpose though often given with that design the nerves are indeed so unactive that we can entertain no reasonable hopes from this quarter  shall we endeavor to excite a cough by the means of effluvia or steams inspired into the lungs that has been tried to no purpose for the membrane which covers the trachea and the mucus or matter which covers the lungs render these parts insensible to any external irritation  to effectuate a solution of the morbid membrane after it is once completely formed and consolidated seems to me impossible by any internal or external medicine that i know to effectuate its expulsion appears equally impossible we have then no method remaining to save the patients life but that of extraction that cannot be done through the glottis when the case is desperate may we not try bronchotomy i can see no weighty objection to that operation as the membrane can be so easily got at and is very loose many a more hazardous operation is daily performed i would propose however that it should be first tried on a dead subject that we may proceed with all manner of caution and assistance but something ought to be tried in this dangerous situation  we have now brought our inquiry to a conclusion the facts we hope will appear curious exact and sufficiently numerous for our purpose the method such as as is used in mathematics and natural philosophy for discovering unknown truths and the conclusions new surprising and naturally arising from the facts if we have not brought this inquiry to that degree of perfection in every point that we could have wished we have the satisfaction at least to think that so far as we go our discoveries are certain as they are built on the foundation of nature shunning with all imaginable care fruitless and deceitful speculations however entertaining we have constantly kept our facts and experiments in view as the only road to the improvement of medicine and the good of mankind  finis
