british zoology  illustrated by plates and brief explanations  london printed and sold by b white in fleet street  mdcclxx  to william constable esquire of burtonconstable dear sir as you have quitted your philosophic retirement give me leave to wish every felicity may attend you and that you may soon be enabled to resume those beloved studies and all the agreeable amusements of which you have so fully learnt the true enjoyment may the tour through the different parts of europe you propose visiting be prosperous and entertaining and to ensure that may your primary object the reestablishment of your health meet with the most perfect success may you return with the same inclinations you set out with with that munificent disposition and that benignity which a retreat from the world instead of impairing as is too often the case has exalted and improved  to the last it is possibly owing that you have entertained such a favorable opinion of my labors in a science we are both so enamoured of to you therefore i address this little supplementary work it may perhaps overtake you on the road and if it does not afford you a transient amusement will at lest give you a proof that absent or present at home or abroad i remain unalterably and with the truest esteem  dear sir your affectionate friend and obedient humble servant thomas pennant downing jan      0 advertisement this publication is intended to illustrate the zoology of great britain and particularly to supply the deficiency of plates in the three first volumes and to correct any errors that may have crept into them every defect of that nature which can be discovered and introduced with propriety into this work will be fairly confessed it being far from the editors design to conceal any mistakes which through his own fallibility through misinformation of others or too great confidence in preceding writers have found a place in the arduous task he has undertaken  the few subjects engraved in this volume which have been before inserted in the folio edition are such only as have been ill expressed in the great book or are intended to exhibit some very different variety or in a few instances merely to fill the plate a very few must be excepted which are repeated in order to give here a series of birds of every british genus and this will apologize for regraving the cuckoo wryneck and a

 on michaelmas day      had the good fortune to have ocular proof of what may reasonably be supposed and actual migration of swallows traveling that morning very early between his house and the coast at the beginning of his journey he was environed with a thick fog but on a large wild heath the mist began to break and discovered to him numberless swallows clustered on the stunted bushes as if they had roosted there as soon as the sun burst out they were instantly on wing and with ix swallow swift an easy and placid flight proceeded toward the sea after this he saw no more flocks only now and then a straggler in kalms voyage to america is a remarkable instance of the distant flight of swallows for one lighted on the ship he was in september   when he had passed over only two thirds of the atlantic ocean his passage was uncommonly quick being performed from deal to philadelphia in less than six weeks and when this accident happened he was fourteen days sail from cape hinlopen   this rendezvous of swallows about the same time of year is very common on the willows in the little isles in the thames they seem to assemble for the same purpose as those in hampshire notwithstanding no one has yet been witness of their departure on the   th of september last two gentlemen who happened to lie at maidenheadbridge furnished at lest a proof of the multitudes there assembled they went by torchlight to an adjacent isle and in less than half an hour brought ashore  0 dozen for they had nothing more to do than to draw the willow twigs through their hands the birds never stirring till they were taken  the northern naturalists will perhaps say that this assembly met for the purpose of plunging into their subaqueous winter quarters but was that the case they would never escape discovery in a river so perpetually fished as the thames some of them must inevitably be brought up in the nets that harass that water  other witnesses crowd on us to prove the residence of those birds in a torpid state during the severe season first in the chalky cliffs of sussex as was seen on the fall of a great fragment some winters ago  secondly in a decayed hollow tree that was cut down near dolgelli in merionethshire  thirdly in a cliff near whitby yorkshire where on digging out a fox whole bushels of swallows were found in a torpid condition  these are doubtless the lurking places of the latter habitations of those young birds who are incapable of distant migrations there they continue insensible and rigid but like flies may sometimes be reanimated by an unseasonable hot day in the midst of winter for very near christmas a few appeared on the moulding of a window of merton college oxford in a remarkable warm nook which prematurely set their blood in motion having the same

enlightened times disproved of the former except the small time it takes for sleeping and what it devotes to incubation every other action is done on wing the materials of its nest it collects either as they are carried about by the winds or picks them from the surface in its sweeping flight its food is undeniably the insect tribe its drink the dew even its amorous rites are performed on high few

height above the head surpass the beauties of our weeping willow  the southern extremity is particularly magnificent the mountains form there a vast theater the bosom of which is covered with extensive forests of pines above the trees grow scarcer and scarcer and then seem only to sprinkle the surface after which vegetation ceases and naked summits of a surprising height succeed many of

is brought on shore the herring is too common a fish to attract the attention of a stranger but the size and form of the tunny is what immediately catches his eye  this fish is the follower of the herring on which it preys and often during night strikes into the nets and does considerable damage when the fishermen draw them up in the morning the tunny rises at the same time toward the surface ready to catch any fish that drop out a strong hook baited with a herring and fixed to a rope is immediately flung out and the tunny seldom fails taking it but as soon as hooked loses all spirit and after very little resistance submits to its fate  they do not come in shoals like the tunnies of the mediterranean for not above two or three are taken in a night which are dragged on shore and cut up

the lower figure is the common species the upper are two white seals taken from a painting in the museum at oxford and probably are young ones  seals are found in great numbers on the north coast of scotland and are seen floating amidst the waves near the foot of the rocks they prey entirely on fish never molesting the birds which swim with great composure amongst them they eat their prey beneath the water and if they are devouring any very oily fish the place is known by a certain smoothness of the waves immediately above  on the coast of caithness are immense caverns opening into the sea and running some hundreds of yards beneath the land these are the resort of seals in the breeding time where they continue till their young are old enough to go to sea which is in about six or seven weeks the first of these caves is near the ord the last near thrumster their entrance is so extremely narrow as only to admit a boat their inside very spacious and lofty in the month of october or the beginning of november the sealhunters enter the mouths of the caverns about midnight and rowing up as far as they can they land each of them being provided with a bludgeon and properly stationed light their torches and make a great noise which brings down the seals from the further end in a confused body with frightful shrieks and cries at first the men are obliged to give way for fear of being overborn but when the first crowd is past kill as many as straggle behind chiefly the young by striking them on the nose a very slight blow on that part dispatches them when the work is over they drag the seals to the boat which two men are left to guard this is a most hazardous employ for should their torches go out or the wind blow hard from sea during their continuance in the cave their lives are lost the young seals are most esteemed yielding more oil than their emaciated dams above eight gallons having been got from a single whelp the oil sells from   d to   d per gallon the skins from   d to    d the growth of the seals is very sudden the sealhunters say that after nine tides from their birth    hours they are as active as their parents this is certain that a whelp which yields that great quantity of oil is not above five or six weeks old  on this coast and on the rock hiskyr one of the western isles is the species of seals as i conjecture described by doctor parsons ph tr no

that it derives its lineage from monaki shaduhi of the pure race of horses purer than milk vide the arabian certificate in a following note for the meaning of this phrase   arabia produces these noble animals in the highest perfection first because they take their origin from the wild unmixed breeds that formerly were found in the deserts leo africanus who wrote in the time of leo x says that in his days great numbers of wild horses were found in the numidian and arabian deserts which were broke for use he adds that the trial of their swiftness was made against the lant or the ostrich and if they could overtake either of those animals they were valued at a hundred camels hist africa      which had as little degenerated from their primaeval form and powers as the lion tiger or any other creature which still remains in a state of nature unchanged by the discipline of man or harvested provision  the arabs place their chief delight in this animal it is to them as a proof of this receive the following lamentation of an arab obliged through poverty to part with his mare my eyes says he to the animal my soul must i be so unfortunate as to have sold thee to so many masters and not to keep thee myself i am poor my antelope you know well enough my honey i have brought thee up as my child i never beat nor chid thee i made as much of thee as ever i could for my life god preserve thee my dearest thou art pretty thou art lovely god defend thee from the looks of the envious to understand the first part of this speech it must be observed that it is usual for many arabs of the poorer rank to join in the purchase of a horse the original owner generally retaining one share this as well as most of the other particulars relating to the arabian horse are taken from m darvieuxs curious account of arabia p     london      as dear as their family and is indeed part of it men women children mares and foals all lie in one common tent and they lodge promiscuously without fear of injury  this constant intercourse produces a familiarity that could not otherwise be effected and creates a tractability in the horses that could arise only from a regular good usage little acts of kindness and a soothing language which they are accustomed to from their masters they are quite unacquainted with the spur the lest touch of the stirrup sets these airy coursers in motion they set off with a

switch taverniers  travels i      paret in obsequium lentae moderamine virgae verbera sunt praecepta fugae sunt verbera fraena nemesiani cyneg      several things concur to maintain this perfection in the horses of arabia such as the great care the arabs take in preserving the breed genuine by permitting none but stallions of the first form to have access to the mares this is never done but in the presence of a witness the secretary of the emir or some public officer he asserts the fact records the name of the horse mare and whole pedigree of each and these attestations the reader is here presented with an original attestation some of which m d arvieux says have been preserved for above  00 years in the public records taken before abdorraman kadi of acca the occasion of this present writing or instrument is that at acca in the house of badi legal established judge appeared in court thomas usgate the english conful and with him sheikh morad ebnal hajj abdollah sheikh of the county of safad and the said consul desired from the aforesaid sheikh proof of the race of the gray horse which he bought of him and he affirmed to be monaki shaduhi these are the names of the   breeds of arab horses which are reckoned pure and true and those which are of both these breeds by father and mother are the most noble and free from bastardy but he was not satisfied with this but desired the testimony of the arabs who bred the horse and knew how he came to sheikh morad whereupon there appeared certain arabs of repute whose names are undermentiond who testified and declared that the gray horse which the consul formerly bought of sheikh morad is monaki shaduki of the pure race of horses purer than milk a proverbial expression and that the beginning of the affair was that sheikh saleh sheikh of alsabal bought him of the arabs of the tribe of al mohammadat and sheikh saleh sold him to sheikh morad ebn al hajj abdollah sheikh of safad and sheikh morad sold him to the consul aforesaid when these matters appeared to us and the contents were known the said gentleman desired a certificate thereof and testimony of the witnesses whereupon we wrote him this certificate for him to keep as a proof thereof i e    jany      dated friday    of the latter rabi in the year       witnesses sheikh jumat al falibau of the arabs of al mohammadat ali ebn taleb al kaabi ibrahim his brother mohammed al adhra sheikh alfarifat khamis al kaabi    are carefully preserved for on these depends the future price of the foal  the arabs whose riches are their horses take all imaginable care of them they have it not in their power to give them grass in their hot climate except in the spring their constant food is barley and that given only in the night being never suffered to eat during the day  in the daytime they are kept saddled at the door of the tent ready for any excursion their masters may make the arabs being fond of the chase and living by the plundering of travelers the horses are never hurt by any servile employ never injured by heavy burdens or by long journies enjoy a pure dry air due exercise great temperance and great care  every horse in arabia except those which by way of contempt are called guidich or pack horses has a degree of good qualities superior to those of other places but it is not to be supposed but that there are certain parts of that country which have attained a higher perfection in the art of management than others  thus we find by some late information wall on horses     that yemine in arabia felix is at present in great repute for its breed for the jockies of that part have acquired such a superior name as to be able to sell their three year old horses for two or three hundred guineas apiece and when they can be prevailed on to part with a favorite stallion they will not take less for it than fifteen hundred guineas it is from this country that the great men in india are supplied with horses for india itself is possessed of a very bad kind these noble animals being much neglected there from the constant use of the buffalo not only in tillage but even in riding  it may be allowed here to give some account of the horses of other countries which derive their origin and at lest receive their improvement from the arabian kind for wheresoever the saracens spread their victorious arms they at the same time introduced their generous race of horses  those of persia are light swift and very like those of arabia but formed very narrow before they are fed with chopped straw mixed with barley and instead of soiling are fed with neweared or green barley for about fourteen or twenty days taverniers travels i       aethiopia has with some writers the credit of having originally furnished arabia with its fine race of horses but we believe the reverse and that they were introduced into that empire by the arabian princes whose lineage to this day fills that throne the horses of that country are spirited and strong and generally of a black color they are never used in long journies but only in battle or in the race for all servile work is done by mules the aethiopians never shoe them for which reason on passing through stony places they dismount and ride on mules and lead their horses ludolph hist aethiop     so from this we may collect that this nation is not less attached to these animals than the arabs  egypt has two breeds of horses one its own the other arabian the last are most esteemed and are bought up at a great price in order to be sent to constantinople but such is the discouragement arising from the tyranny of the government that the owners often wilfully lame a promising horse univ modern hist quoted from maillet and pocock lest the beys should like it and force it from them  barbary owes its fine horses to the same stock which in general are far inferior in point of value and for the same reason as is given in the last article the great insecurity of property under the turkish government the breed was once very famous m darvieux darvieux     says that when he was there in      he met with a mare that he thought worthy of the stud of his grand monarque when in the height of his glory but doctor shaw informs us that at present the case is entirely altered shaws travels       notwithstanding spain has been celebrated of old for the swiftness of its horses yet it must have received great improvement from those brought over by their conquerors the saracens according to oppian cyneg lib i v      the spanish breed had no other merit than that of fleetness but at present we know that they have several other fine qualities  to sum up the account of this generous animal we may observe that every country that boasts of a fine race of horses is indebted to arabia their primaeval seat no wonder then that the poetic genius of the author of the book of job who not only lived on the very spot but even at a time when the animal creation still enjoyed much of its original perfection should be able to compose that sublime description which has always been the admiration of every person of genuine taste job chapter xxxix v    to      li sea eagle   lii peregrine falcon

four first classes of british animals catalogue of the european quadrupeds birds and reptiles extrabritannic since the great use of mr rays sylloge stirpium europaearum extra britannias stirpium europoearum extra britannias nascentium sylloge      has been so fully approved by the traveling botanist it is thought a similar enumeration of the species of certain classes of the animal kingdom would be equally agreeable and serviceable to the traveling zoologist it comprehends the extrabritannic quadrupeds birds and reptiles of europe formed from the works of the general naturalists from the fauna of different countries and from my own observations the arrangement of the subjects are according to the excellent method of our countryman mr ray a little altered or reformed as there are not at this instant english names for most of the articles we have been obliged to substitute those used by linnoeus and other foreign writers but to gratify the english readers curiosity who may wish for fuller accounts of the quadrupeds in his own language we refer him to the second column to out own synopsis of quadrupeds speedily to be published and in respect to the birds to the english
