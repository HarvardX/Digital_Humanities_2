a treatise on the gout in which the cause is first briefly assigned and secondly an effectual and certain cure is pointed out  by arentius ferdinand lambrechts m d  studere verum invenire london

christopher kene m d of middelburgh in zeeland  the following concise treatise is humbly inscribed  that by its usefulness and service it may merit your esteem and obtain your kind acceptance is the sincere desire of the author  a f lambrechts  the introduction the learned dr wintringham in the introduction to his treatise on the gout tractatus de podagra in  vo  very justly observes that the phenomenon of this disease have been variously treated by authors and rendered intricate by the numbers of hypotheses which have wholly obscured the true nature of this malady or at least have only given us a lame and uncertain account wherefore he closes it in the following manner it is clear that this disease as yet remains in the dark which we hope may one day appear in its proper light i have already made some small mention concerning this malady in my compendium anatomicomedicum practicum published in latin anno       it is not the empty zeal of applause that pushes me on to make public the following treatise but the real service of mankind and the welfare of those who are afflicted with this severe disorder  benevolent reader  i beseech your acceptance of this short essay with humanity and candor humbly desiring that any errors you may meet with may in a humane and friendly manner be set to rights  if this should prove acceptable to mankind i will in a short time make public all my particular observations on the gout  it will be to no purpose to detain you any longer from the treatise itself therefore i close this introduction with the following lines  tu scio tu fateor novisii rectius istis tu scio tu fateor me meliora facis sed rogo sufficiat tibi cum meliora nequirem reddere debendi semper habere reum farewell  a treatise on the gout the gout is a tensive and lacerating pain about the joints chiefly returning in hippoc sect vi aphorism    spring and autumn arising from an obstruction in the nervous vessels and acrimony of the fluids whence redness swelling and chalky concretions herm boerhaave aphoris        etc  in general it is called arthritis from the greek word  signifying a joint because this complaint chiefly seizes those parts it likewise takes its name from the several parts of the body it attacks to wit in the hands chiragra from  a hand and  a prey or seizure thereby denoting its cruel ravages and injury wheresoever it comes  the sciatica or hipgout from  the hip in the knees gonogra from  the knee and   podagra in like manner is from  the foot and  whence the gout in the feet is so termed  there are various other denominations which all take their origin from the parts affected the cause being still the same sometimes seizing one place sometimes another  many are apt to believe the rheumatism to be either gout or scurvy but improperly it has its name from  to flow hence  a rheum thereby denoting a flowing of humors to a part yet the rheumatism partakes somewhat of these diseases  the renowned sydenham has well treated this disease yet must own in my opinion he makes use of bleeding too frequently it chiefly shows itself in the same places where the gout appears whence in some measure the mistake arises  the lumbago was observed by the ancients in which the pain in the loins is so great that the patient is obliged to sit or stand upright if he moves to either side or endeavors to bend forward or backward then he suffers excruciating pains and sometimes even convulsions the same difficulties are found in moving the neck if that part is afflicted as it often happens to be when it seizes the region of the os sacrum it is often termed the lower rheumatic lumbago by some also it is called the rheumatic gonogra if in the knees yet this disease may for the most part be distinguished from the gout and scurvy if the person has not had either of these before then i should esteem it the rheumatism and not the gout  it is not necessary for me here to explain the cause of the regular fit of the gout which invades a little before the vernal equinox and after the autumnal for wintringham has learnedly treated of this cap iv see also de gorters commentary in his medicina hippocratica on hipp sect vi aphorism      the noble willis and heinsius also who has wrote in dutch a tract of this malady deserves to be read again and again which makes good the old proverb  lectio lecta placet decies repetita placebit the gout under its various denominations is either hereditary or acquired its cause is two fold  first from a straitness and rigidity or stiffness of the nervous vessels  secondly from an acrimony and tenacity of the fluids h boerh aphorism          hence every fault committed in the nonnaturals to wit air meat and drink sleep and watching motion and rest retention and excretion and the passions of the mind as they are termed by physicians hasten and bring on the fit it principally afflicts in parts remote from the brain the defect lies in the last office of digestion  st from our food is chyle produced  dly the serum or whey  dly the blood and lastly the nervous spirit  the viscera or organs of the first concoctions are good but that ultimate or last effect is not properly performed our master of the faculty the great boerhaave is of the same opinion for he saw a patient who had about the joint a swelling that broke without pain he forced a needle quite through to the bone without any uneasiness and took out this chalky matter which was made up with the smallest vessels thus destroyed and changed it is also plain that the blood serum etc are not in fault for they equally exercise their several functions the gouty subject can reason properly and feels the power of love as before hence i have often admired hippocrates where he says the gout cleanses the most minute recesses of the blood in old men for after a fit they for the most part remain free and well for months and in this course they may obtain the good old age of fourscore or upwards wherefore this disease must not be in the blood but in the ultimate  or spirit of the blood  hence it is necessary as also paracelsus and helmont observes that the whole body be recruited in the solids and the fluids mended and corrected before the cure can be accomplished but this is to be done by restorative medicaments and not those of a purgative quality  otto tachenius in his tract de morborum principe says that a subtle corroding acid is the cause of the gout and hence an alcali it being quite an opposite destroying and driving out the malady he esteems as a specific which acrid cause arising from too great rigidity or straitness in the vessels venery etc destroys the best and finest part of the nerves he got great profit by this invention yet the medicine did not answer it is inscribed on the statue erected to the memory of paracelsus that he could cure the gout by which i suppose is to be understood he cured the fit by ordering a good diet giving proper anodynes etc but this does not root out the seeds of the disease nature left to herself would have performed thus much  a man in holland made trial of all the remedies he could pick up among the rest the caryocostinum but was much the worse for it notwithstanding the great praises given it by its inventor eugenius  in england as well as in holland there is a noted powder highly recommended in this disease it is made with germander ground pine the lesser centaury the roots of birthworth and gentian and distinguished by the title of the great and noble duke of portland it is true this powder will mitigate the pains but in my practice i have found it to produce obstructions in the smaller vessels and cause the morbid matter to attack fresh places hence if it should retire to some of the more noble viscera death in a short time must be the event i readily own that if the gouty person having this malady only in a recent and slight manner observes a good diet during the use of this powder he may for a time have his pains lessened and abated but it is not in the power of this remedy to eradicate the peccant matter  the gout is not only dangerous in itself but likewise of all diseases the most severe and obstinate in its continuance tormenting poor mortals for the most part as long as lise lasts from whence the saying  tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram juvenal we may further add the words of dr wintringham in the end of his treatise where he observes that notwithstanding the vain boastings of empirics it is quite evident that no specific has been given by the help of which this disease has been rooted out  hippocrates takes notice that eunuchs have not the gout neither are bald or bareheaded also that women in our days this holds not good but pray can we find no reason for this crescentibus delictis crescunt paenae  frigora vina venus podagrant corpora nostra   are free from it unless their natural courses are deficient and further that youth have it not before they use venery hipp sect vi aph       and  0 h boerhaave aphorism       h boerhaave aphorism          our father hippocrates has here declared things worth notice but yet he does not say this disease is incurable  the excellent boerhaave observes that this disease cannot be cured unless by medicines which have power to correct and change the bad state of the body whence this disorder arises  the hereditary gout and that attended with stony concretions are of all the most difficult to cure for the hereditary is the effect of the whole compages of the human machine and shows itself in its own proper time in like manner as the secretion of the male seed appears after puberty having its origin from the nerves so ingendered  the tophi or chalkstones do not happen till after all the juices of the body have been infected hence we may plainly learn why they are the worst and most difficult to be cured the celebrated john de gorter late professor at harderwych but at present of petersburg observes in his chirurgia repurgata lib ii cap ii par  0  that the tophi or nodes in the lues venerea are to be treated in the same manner as a caries or rottenness of the bones but that no remedy has been given for the gouty tophi there is good reason in what this worthy man mentions for ointments emplasters etc externally applied do nothing it being necessary first to remove the cause and then the tophi will spontaneously disappear   now to the method of treating this disease herm boerhaave aphorism    0   during the paroxysm or fit i carefully avoid every thing which may hinder or disturb the evacuation of the peccant matter therefore i shun bleeding for the blood being lessened in quantity the pressure toward the excretory vessels is likewise diminished and thus the matter which should be evacuated is retained whereby grievous and heavy symptoms ensue  dr wintringham directs emetics and purgatives to be repeated occasionally in order to clear the primae viae of their crudities but i abstain from such remedies for they occasion a tumult in the nervous juices draw off the more fluid parts and destroy their expulsive power herm boerhaave aph       whereby the natural secretions are much hindered  medicines that encourage sweat and also those that pass by urine make the circulation of the blood more rapid and of course the offending matter is determined in a larger quantity to be separated and carried off hence the present fit will be increased it is best that the concoction and evacuation of the gouty matter be left to the sole work of nature  i would refer the reader to the     d aphorism of the immortal boerhaave it deserving a particular regard nay even all of them on this subject are well worth our perusal  during the fit we can only endeavor to render the pain as mild as possible by blunting the acrimony or sharpness of the morbid matter and gently helping forward its expulsion out of the body to effect this i endeavor to dilute and thin the blood that the matter unfit for circulation and lodged at the joints may flow with more facility and ease i order a temperating powder three or four times in a day with a medicated liquor to be plentifully drank when the pain is severe and scarce sufferable i give fifty sixty or seventy dops of an anodyne elixir in a large draught of the above drink i never use any outward application during the fit unless the sick person should be very impatient and desirous of it in which case i apply an anodyne cataplasm or fomentation if the gouty matter should recoil to the internal parts and there attack some of the noble viscera or bowels we must immediately try all in our power to drive it out again to the joints with large draughts of an aromatic decoction fomentations and blisters too if requisite herm boerhaave aphorism      by these means many may be preserved from sudden death  out of the fit i take care to prevent the increase of the gouty matter also to shake off that which has in some measure begun to fix itself and for that purpose  first the patient must carefully observe a good diet especially a milky one for milk has been separated from every gross part having already passed through the several digestions in the animal hence it does not beget those crudities any other diet is liable to  the gouty patient while he is under his course of medicines ought to have the following verse inscribed over his chamberdoor  esto pius domino sobrius tibi justus in omnes ista tria animae causa salutis erit the celebrated dolaeus writ well on this head encyclop med p      learn a lesson says he from the rank herd of debauchees who in our tipplinghouses gorge themselves with strong beer what foul savours exhale from their impure bodies how are they agitated by an unquiet and restless life how great a dullness to their wit how benumbed their senses how feeble their limbs how overwhelmed is that noble part their brain as when the earth is wet by heavy rains linen and paper grow limp and moist standing waters and sewers stink and are offensive even so when too much liquor has diffused itself through the whole body the breast etc are beset with catarrhs the ears have a tinkling noise the eyes grow dim a cough invades the lungs the head is seized with giddiness the nerves and muscles are tortured with pains not unlike those of the gout and all this is the effect of too hard drinking  qui vult alterius cyathis haurire salutem ille lucrum referet perdat ut ipse suum ense cadunt multi perimit sed crapula plures nec facit ad multos rapula multa dies the great boerhaave directs the use of aromatic bitter and antiscorbutic plants lixivial fixed salts in a small dose often repeated and continued a a long time nourishing meats and drink that are light and easy of digestion constant riding on horseback in a pure and clear air with frequent friction and motion of the parts lastly going to bed early and sleeping late in the morning herm boerh aphorism        the reader may farther compare this with the words of doctor wintringham in his beforementioned treatise he may also see my dissertatio medica de sanitate ejusque conservatione where i have expressly wrote on diet and the preservation of health  constant exercise is directed by the noble boerhaave and very justly too for sloth is sepulcher of the living to stand still and be unactive is pernicious if the air stagnates it becomes pestilential if water is without motion it soon is putrid and corrupt if the land is not cultivated it becomes desert and waste in like manner the warrior laying aside his arms rust and canker prey upon them the musician too neglecting his instrument the chords of harmony decay and are useless the moth also makes his inroads on our horded garments thus sings the poet ovid  cernis ut ignavium corrumpunt otia corpus ut vitium capiunt ni moveantur aquae lib ii eleg vi what says the old divine hippocrates indolence moistens and renders the body weak and flaccid labor and industry throws off the superfluous juices and makes it firm and robust  the disease of drowsiness and unstable judgment is the offspring of negligence and want of care rolfinck meth med spec praef ad lect in princip   always to sit is bad for the pancreatic juice and bile which is a balsam necessary to be mixed with the chyle is by this inactivity precipitated in the smaller intestines hence arises a cacochylia or bad state of chyle wherefore instead of a sweet nutritious chyle an acid aquose fluid enters the lacteals  also the ferment in the stomach becomes acid which afterward changes whatever it receives into the same acidity after the manner of the fermentation in making bread for a little yeast being mingled with the flour etc soon communicates the same ferment to the whole mass hence varirious diseases arise  blautus palinurus in curcurl act    p     directs a cappadocian whose blood had not a free circulation to walk it being the best remedy for the spleen  agreeable to boerhaave every gouty person ought to ride in a clear but not a cold air as chilliness or cold is the forerunner of mortality thus a due warmth shows the vital intestine motion that is so necessary to life for as long as we live we must enjoy a more or less degree of heat cold is injurious to the nerves as euripides bears testimony where he says  that is cold is very hurtful to a thin or lean habit of body  hippocrates also takes notice that those who travel through snow or in extreme cold weather so as to have their feet hands etc benumbed thereby are much afflicted by their approach to any sudden heat and have intolerable itchings and that in some even blisters arise like those from a burn but this happens not till after they begin to grow warm  cold bathing is prejudicial for it produces a sudden hurry and tumult to nature because of the immediate change from the warm air into cold water thus the perspiration is in a moment checked and all the moist impure and saline effluvia remaining within the pores they putrify and inflame the whole mass of blood and so produce fevers inflammations gout etc concerning the disadvantages of cold bathing see oration d wesserhausen de diaeta stud s   p   it zeil handb p    p  0  zacut lucit h ephem germ an   obs    dol d   p   0   the reason is that the body undergoes a greater alteration by air from  transpiration or breathing of vapors through the pores than from  inspiration or taking air into the lungs hence an  or obstruction of the natural perspiration is the mother of many diseases  it is observed that many who labor under fevers etc in the spring if they do not guard themselves well against the air though they may escape death yet are subject to relapses  moreover the sick man should be early in bed in the evening and late in the morning as boerhaave observes for sleep is the best specific in all diseases it is a secret in medicine more valuable than gems or precious stones and that physician ought to be much esteemed who can assist the wants of nature in this respect with security and advantage to the sick croll basil chym p  0   sleep is health to the body and a refreshment to nature as necessary as our meat and drink it is beautifully described in the following lines of the poet viz  somne quies rerum placidissime somne deorum pax animi quem cara fugit tu

tired with vain rotations of the day sleep winds us up for the succeding dawn fresh we spin on till sickness clogs our wheels or death quite breaks the spring and motion ends secondly he must every morning rub well the gouty parts especially about the joints with a flannel full of the smoke from a suffimugation which is made by a powder sprinkled on live coals for that use and take one dram of an arcanum antipodagricum reformatum three times a day when the stomach is most empty drinking after it a draught or two of medicated drink  the gouty subject must regularly continue this course of
