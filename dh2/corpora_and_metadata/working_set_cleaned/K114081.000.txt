a prospect of society one sink of level avarice shall lie and even the worth of kings unhonord die yet think not thus when freedoms isles i state i mean to flatter kings or court the great think not i mean to sap my countrys good i would not heaven be witness if i could but when i see contention hem the throne a bridging kingly power to stretch her own when i behold a factious band agree to call it freedom when themselves are free senates in blood the code of justic draw laws grind the poor and opulence the law the wealth of climes where savage nations roam pillaged from slaves to purchase slaves at home i cannot forbear but all my passions start to tear the barb that grides my swelling heart i cannot forbear but half a coward grown i wish to shrink from tyrants to the throne yes my loved brother cursed be that hour when first ambition toiled for foreign power when britons learnt to swell beyond their shore and barter useful men for useless ore to shine with splendors that destruction haste like flaring tapers brightening as they waste have we not seen at pleasures lordly call an hundred villages in ruin fall beheld the duteous son the sire decayed the modest matron and the blushing maid forced from their homes a melancholy train to traverse climes beyond the western main where wild oswego spreads her swamps around and niagara stuns with thundering sound even now perhaps as there some pilgrim strays through tangling sorests and through dangerous ways through woods where beasts divided empire claim and the brown indian takes a deadly aim there while above the forceful tempest flies and all around distressful yellings rise the famished exile bends beneath his woe and faintly fainter fainter seems to go casts a fond look where britains shores recline and gives his griefs to sympathize with mine war in each breast and freedom on each brow how much unlike the sons of britain now flushed at the sound my genius spreads her wing and flies where britain broods the western spring where lawns extend that spurn arcadian pride and brighter streams than famed campaspe glide there all around the gentlest breezes stray there gentle music melts on every spray creations mildest charms are there combined extremes are only in the masters mind stern over each bosom reason holds her state with daring aims irregularly great i see the lords of mankind pass me by with haughty port defiance in their eye intent on high designs a thoughtful band by forms unfashiond fresh from natures hand fierce in a native hardihood of soul true to imagined right whatever control while even the peasant boasts these rights to scan and learns to venerate himself as man thine freedom thine the blessings pictured here thine are those charms that dazzle and endear happy indeed were such without alloy but even from freedom issuing ills annoy that independence britons prize too high keeps man from man and cuts the social tie there though by circling deeps together held minds combat minds repelling and repelled ferments arise imprisoned factions roar represt ambition struggles round her shore whilst overwrought the general system feels its motions stopped or phrenzy fire the wheels nor rest their ills as social bonds decay as duty love and honor fail to sway fictitious bonds the bonds of wealth and law still gather strength and force unwilling awe hence all distinctions paid to these alone talent must sink and merit weep unknown till time may come when stripped of all her charms that land of scholars and that nurse of arms where ancestry avows the noble claim and statesmen toil and poets pant for fame to men of other minds my fancy flies embosomd in the deep where holland lies methinks her patient sons before me stand where the broad ocean leans against the land and sedulous to stop the coming tide lift the tall rampires artificial pride that spreads its arms amidst the swelling main and scoops an empire from the watery reign onward methinks and diligently slow the firm connected bulwark seems to go while ocean pent and rising over the pile sees an amphibious world beneath him smile the slow canal the yellow blossomed vale the willow tufted bank the gliding sail plains forests town in gay profusion dressed a new creation ravish from his breast thus while around the wavesubjected soil impels the native to repeated toil industrious habits in each breast obtain and industry begets a love of gain hence all the good from opulence that springs with all those ills superfluous treasure brings are here displayed their muchloved wealth imparts convenience plenty elegance and arts but turn the medal craft and fraud appear even liberty itself is bartered here at golds superior charms all freedom flies the needy sell it and the rich man buys a land of tyrants and a den of slaves here wretches seek dishonorable graves and calm beneath their injuries conform dull as their lakes quiescent in a storm heavens how unlike their belgic sires of old rough poor content ungovernably bold where shading elms beside the margin grew and freshend from the waves the zephyr blew and happily though my harsh touch faltering still but mocked all tune and marred the dancers skill yet would the village praise my wondrous power and dance forgetful of the noontide hour alike all ages dames of ancient days have led their children through the mirthful maze and the gay grandsire skilled in gestic lore has friskd beneath the burden of threescore so blessed a life these thoughtless realms display thus idly strenuous rolls their world away theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear for honor forms the social temper here honor that praise which real merit gains or even imaginary worth obtains here passes current paid from hand to hand it shifts its splendid traffic round the land from courts to camps to cottages it strays and all are taught an avarice of praise they please are pleased they give to get esteem till seeming blessed they grow to what they seem but while this softer art their bliss supplies it gives their follies also room to rise for praise too dearly loved or warmly sought enfeebles all internal strength of thought and the weak soul within itself unblest leans for all pleasure on anothers breast hence ostentation here with tawdry art pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart here vanity assumes the pert grimace and trims her robes of frize with copper lace here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer to boast one splendid dish for once a year and scarce a man is found who rightly weighs the solid transports of internal praise these are the charms to barren states assigned their wants are few their wishes all confined yet let them only share the praises due if few their wants their pleasures are but few since every want that stimulates the breast becomes a means of pleasure when possessed hence from such lands each pleasing science flies that first excites desire and then supplies unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy to fill the languid pause with finer joy unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame catch every nerve and vibrate through the frame their level life is but a smouldring fire nor quenched by want nor fand by strong desire unfit for raptures or if raptures cheer on some high festival of once a year in wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire till buried in debauch the bliss expire but not their joys alone thus coarsly flow their morals like their pleasures are but low for as refinement stops from sire to son manners in one unmending track will run and love and friendships finely pointed dart fall blunted from each indurated heart some sterner virtues over the mountains breast may sit like falcons cowring on the nest but all the gentler morals such as play through lifes more cultured walks and charm our way these far disperse on timorous pinions fly to sport and flutter in a kinder sky to kinder skies where gentler manners reign we turn where france displays her bright domain thou sprightly land of mirth and social ease pleased with thyself whom all the world can please how often have i led thy sportive choir with tuneless pipe along the sliding loire no vernal bloom their torpid rocks display but winter lingering chills the lap of may no zephyr fondly sooths the mountains breast but meteors glare and frowning storms invest yet still even here content can spread a charm redress the clime and all its rage disarm though poor the peasants hut his feasts though small he sees his little lot the lot of all see no contiguous palace rear its head to shame the meanness of his humble shed no costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal to make him loath his vegetable meal but calm and bred in ignorance and toil each wish contracting fits him to the soil cheerful at morn he wakes from short repose breasts the keen air and carrols as he goes with patient angle trolls the finny deep or drives his venurous plowshare to the steep or seeks the den where snow tracks mark the way and drags the struggling savage into day at night returning every labor sped he sits him down the monarch of a shed smiles by his cheerful fire and round surveys his childrens looks that brighten at the blaze while his loved partner boastful of her hoard displays the cleanly platter on the board and happily too some pilgrim thither led with many a tale repays the nightly bed thus every good his native wilds impart imprints the patriot passion at his heart dear in that shed to which his soul conforms and dear that hill which lifts him to the storms and as a babe when scaring sounds molest clings close and closer to the mothers breast so the loud torrent and the whirlwinds roar but bind him to his native mountains more for wealth was theirs nor far removed the date when commerce proudly flourished through the state at her command the palace learnt to rise again the longfalln column sought the skies the canvass glowed with animation warm the pregnant quarry teemed with human form but more unstable than the southern gale soon commerce turned on other shores her sail and late the nation sound with fruitless skill their former strength was now plethoric ill yet though to fortune lost there still abide some splendid arts the wrecks of former pride from which the seeble heart and long fallen mind an easy compensation seems to find here may be seen in bloodless pomp arrayed the pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade processions formed for piety and love a mistress or a saint in every grove at sports like these are all their cares beguiled the sports of children satisfy the child at sports like these while foreign arms advance they proudly swell and leave the world to chance when strenuous aims have suffered long control they leave at last or feebly man the soul while low delights succeeding fast behind in happier meanness occupy the mind as in those domes where caesars once bore sway but now by time dismantled in decay amidst the ruin heedless of the dead the shelterseeking peasant builds his shed and wondering man could want the larger pile exults and owns his cottage with a smile my soul turn from them turn we to survey where rougher climes a nobler race display where the bleak swiss their stormy mansions tread and force a churlish soil for scanty bread no product here the barren hills afford but man and steel the soldier and his sword far to the right where appenine ascends bright as the summer italy extends her uplands sloping deck the mountains side woods over woods in gay theatric pride while often some temples mouldering tops between with venerable grandeur marks the scene could natures bounty satisfy the breast the sons of italy were surely blessed whatever fruits in different climes are found that proudly rise or humbly court the ground whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear that dress in bright succession round the year whatever sweets salute the northern sky with vernal leaves that blossom but to die these here disporting own the kindred soil nor ask luxuriance from the planters toil while seaborne gales their gelid wings expand to winnow fragrance round the smiling land but small the bliss that sense alone bestows and sensual bliss is all the nation knows in rich luxuriance plants and flowers appear men seem the only growth that dwindles here contrasted faults through all their manners reign though poor luxurious though submissive vain though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue and even in penance planning sins anew all ills are here to pejorate the mind that opulence departed leaves behind nor less the patriots boast wherever we roam his first best country ever is at home and yet perhaps if states with states we scan or estimate their bliss on reasons plan though patriots flatter and though fools contend we still shall find the doubtful scale depend find that each good by art or nature given to these or those but makes the balance even nature a mother kind alike to all still grants her blessings at industrys call and though the rigid clime or rough rocks frown these rocks by custom turn to beds of down from art more various are the blessings sent wealth splendours freedom honor and content yet these each others power so strong contest that either seems subversive of the rest hence every state to one loved blessing prone chiefly conforms itself to that alone
